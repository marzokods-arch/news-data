Named the Dark Perk Ergo and Dark Perk Sym , both mice sport a 110-hour battery life (at 1000 Hz), 55 g weight, 8000 Hz polling rate (even while wireless), and a DPI of 32,000. The main difference is that the Sym is symmetrical and the Ergo is reportedly ergonomic. Be Quiet! says the Ergo is \"intuitively easy to grip\", but we'll need to go hands-on with it to feel how true that is. Be Quiet! CEO Aaron Licht says, \"Our move into gaming mice had one goal: to deliver an extremely lightweight mouse that helps users compete at the highest levels of the leaderboards.\" On the internals, Be Quiet! shares that both mice have optical Omron D2FP-FN2 switches and a PixArt PAW3950 sensor. They can also be configured using a web-based app for Windows, iOS, and even Linux (via Chromium-based browsers) without the need for any software. This is a neat touch. Both the Ergo and Sym will be available from February 3 with a suggested retail price of $110. We do like plenty of Be Quiet! products: We declared the Light Mount the best gaming keyboard of 20…",

It is a radical move, relying on a more decentralized creative organization with faster decision making and best-in-class cross functional core services supporting and serving each Creative House.\" If that \"creative house\" term sounds familiar, you're likely thinking of Vantage Studios , the Tencent-backed operation announced in 2025 that now holds control over the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six games.

I feel stodgy and static without them. The argument for vaulting them, as laid out by Epic's design director Ted Timmins , is that Fortnite had a \"combat fleeing issue\" that spoiled fights. \"If we are being honest with ourselves,\" he said, \"as much as we all love shockwaves, is it actually skilful to just throw one at your feet and immediately be able to escape an engagement?\" This echoes some but not all of the arguments made by streamer NickEh30 in December . He too said that shockwaves made escaping fights too easy—but added they also negate high-ground advantage, ruin early rotations, and outclass all other mobility items. Fans wondered whether NickEh30's prompted Epic's move, but Timmins denied that in his post. I and most users on the game's subreddit disagree with the decision to vault shockwaves—I'll explain why in a minute—but I do sympathize with both Timmins and NichEh30. Shockwaves can be a crutch.

In case you're unaware, WoW's been of a mind to fix its UI mod (addon) problem for a long time. Specifically, combat addons—the idea being, a player shouldn't have a raw competitive advantage because they had a bunch of third-party plugins installed. Blizzard announced its plans to cull combat addons last year, and that day has finally come. (Addons that don't impact combat are fine, although they do need updating.) I've hopped in and had some time to fiddle around with the changes on my Outlaw Rogue—both the lack of combat addons, the class changes made to facilitate that, and Blizzard's updated \"Cooldown Manager\" and Personal Resource display.

While it's much more subtle and nebulous than these changes, Bungie has also claimed it's \"doubling down on the dark, gritty, and grounded sci-fi world\" through an updated visual style, \"deepened environmental storytelling\", and the narrative-tracking Codex. This focus on narrative and world in an extraction shooter is rather hard to understand without seeing it in action. Nevertheless, when Bungie announced the voice cast for Marathon , with the likes of Samantha Béart, Roger Clark, Darin De Paul, Jennifer English, Neil Newbon, and Ben Starr, I was very taken aback. It's stacked, especially for a game like this.

As I discovered, a Thunderbolt 5 hub runs anywhere from expensive to 'good lord, they can't be serious, can they?' The Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma I'm looking at today is more the latter at $400 / £400 . But do cheaper Thunderbolt 5 hubs come with RGB lighting? They do not—at least most I've seen. The Thunderbolt 5 Dock offers a range of ports to those willing to drop that sort of moolah on the thing: 3x Thunderbolt 5 (downstream), 1x Thunderbolt 5 (upstream; for the connection to your PC, with 140 W power delivery), 1 Gb ethernet, 2x USB Type-A 3.2 Gen2, 1x USB Type-C 3.2 Gen2, an SD card slot, and a microphone/headphone combo port. Thunderbolt 5 supports PCIe 4.0, DisplayPort 2.1 and USB4 standards for a properly universal dock over a few of those connections.

The original suit alleged the company had \"engaged in a systematic strategy\" of buying up competitors, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, in order to maintain its social media monopoly. The case was brought before a US district judge in Washington, who ultimately ruled last year that Meta had not violated antitrust laws with these acquisitions. In his decision, Judge James Boasberg even noted that the FTC itself had reviewed and approved both Meta's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, as well as the company's 2014 purchase of WhatsApp. Undeterred, the FTC is appealing that decision, and still highlights those same acquisitions as the motivation behind its most recent appeal .

    "body": "Internal OpenAI documents predict the AI specialist is set to bleed fully $14 billion in losses for 2026 according to a new report. It's also claimed that OpenAI will continue to make huge losses totalling $44 billion until 2029, when it won't just turn a profit, but will by then be generating Nvidia-style revenues. A new report from The Information claims to have seen internal OpenAI documents setting out various financial performance projections. That $14 billion loss for 2026 is said to be roughly three times worse than early estimates for 2025. Over the 2023 through end of 2028 period, the report claims OpenAI expects to lose $44 billion, before turning a profit of $14 billion in 2029. Somewhat incongruously, The Information also says that OpenAI's cash burn is not as bad as previously thought, with the company tearing through a mere $340 million in the first half of the most recent financial year. How that squares with overall losses counted in multiple billions isn't explained. The report further claims that OpenAI plans to spend an astonishing $200 billion through the end of the decade, 60% to 80% of which will be spent on training and running AI models. So, how does OpenAI…",

According to Kurt Kuhlmann, Bethesda's former Elder Scrolls loremaster and the co-lead designer on Skyrim, \"the main problem with Starfield is it didn't fully cohere as a game\". Kuhlmann left Bethesda in 2023, around the time of Starfield's launch, so he was there throughout development and thus was present for a lot of changes in regards to how Bethesda worked and how staff communicated. When he was working on Skyrim, itself a massive endeavour, things were simpler. \"I was working directly on the game, and I was a lead,\" he says. \"That was how all the leads worked then, and so I was directly working with all the people, all the quest designers, myself.\" But from Skyrim on, that started to change, and it was \"one of the main things\" that Kuhlmann \"didn't like\".

    "body": "For anyone hoping against hope that the memory supply crisis just might start to stabilise in 2026, I've got bad news: An executive at Kioxia, a memory manufacturer based in Japan, recently admitted that the company's production volume for the year is already sold out. The managing director of Kioxia's memory business unit, Shunsuke Nakato, made the admission during an interview with Korean news outlet Digital Daily , elaborating that the ever-hungry AI industry's demand for memory has led to a challenging supply and demand situation. Nakato went on to say that, as many companies are continuing to invest in AI out of a fear of being left behind, the situation is likely to continue into 2027 at least. Though memory supplies are limited, Kioxia is apparently deploying something of a 'gentleman's agreement' with its clients, remaining committed to existing contracts rather than adopting a 'first-come, first-served' or 'everything to the highest bidder' approach. However, Nakato also admits that even long-term Kioxia customers are having to contend with as much as a 30% year-on-year price increase. Also interesting to note from this interview is Nakato's scepticism about QLC tech. For…",

I'd forgive you for believing that your end goal right now is finding mithril ore, but that's not the case. Mithril's not actually available yet, despite it being required for several recipes listed in-game. The good news is that, when it's eventually added, it won't just be another block to break—presumably in the unreleased fifth zone. Hypixel's founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme, says , \"We got some fun ideas about Mithril… let’s say it won't be as simple to mine as the others\". As for what these ideas are, exactly, that of course remains to be seen, and it's added to an already long list of to-dos the team already has to tackle— Collins-Laflamme only bought back the project two months ago and whipped up the early access build in record time, after all.

It's not the biggest addition in PowerToys 0.97 , but Cursor Wrap might just be mana from heaven for some PC enthusiasts. As the name suggests, activating this tool essentially links the edges of multiple displays together, so as you pop off the edge of one monitor, the mouse cursor should seamlessly appear on the opposing edge of the next display. I know Windows already does this when you have, say, two monitors, but when you have something like two rows of three displays, stacked on top of each other, it actually does a poor job of moving the cursor around. This is especially true if you have the desktop expanded across the whole caboodle. With Cursor Wrap, that's no longer an issue, and you'll find that your mouse can now zip vertically through displays with ease. It does the same thing even if you only have one screen, linking the opposing edges into a uni…",

According to Digitimes (via Tomshardware ), \"Windows on Arm (WoA) platform notebooks using the N1X will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\" The report claims that after the launch of an initial variant of N1X in Q1 2026, three more versions of the chip will be released in Q2. What's more, Digitimes further says that Nvidia has a follow up, codenamed N2, lined up for release in the third quarter. If all this is true it's both exciting and somewhat peculiar. After all, we've just had the CES 2026 show , which surely would have been the perfect opportunity to get the maximum number of eyeballs on what Nvidia presumably plans to be a game changing chip for the PC industry.

    "body": "Amid a memory supply crisis, in small part fueled by a shortage of NAND flash, it's perhaps unsurprising that talk of a successor would now appear. Enter ReRAM, or 'resistive random access memory.' The tech has been in development for some time, though startup Weebit Nano Limited has just signed a licensing deal with semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments to finally bring it to a broader audience. According to Weebit Nano , this agreement will see its ReRAM tech \"integrated into [Texas Instruments] advanced process nodes for embedded processing semiconductors.\" Despite what the name suggests, ReRAM isn't actually Random Access Memory, but a Non-Volatile Memory (think NAND, but not—I'll elaborate shortly). So, why is this worth getting excited about? For a start, we've not really heard a peep about the tech in a long old time, and this high-profile deal pushes it back into the spotlight. For another, ReRAM will apparently give traditional flash memory a run for its money as Weebit describes it as a \"low-power, cost-effective NVM that has proven excellent retention at high temperatures.\" To elaborate, ReRAM is non-volatile, so it's more like NAND in that it can retain data aft…",

This is a Remedy game, after all. I don't remember a huge amount about its combat except that there's a lot of dashing, a lot of offensive levitating, and somehow office furniture is always involved. What I do remember well is the setting: Control is an action game, but it's also a very arch horror game set in the austere pebblecrete hallways of a brutalist tower called The Oldest House. Control's story and setting is often compared to the fictional SCP Foundation, which is basically hyper-conspiratorial crowdsourced weird fiction that has also inspired stuff like Lethal Company .

Since it's a global launch on all platforms, you folks living in Pacific time can play a day early on Wednesday, January 21, at 7 pm PST. The Arknights: Endfield client is available through Hypergryph's official site or Epic Games . If you plan on playing, I recommend at least checking out the official site (and missions ) ahead of tim…",

But after that, he says it's on employers and job seekers to, more or less, just start using AI. \"The demand side of this is a little bit like, every firm has to start by using it,\" said Nadella, throwing in some industry-standard hyperbole by calling AI a \"cognitive amplifier\" that gives you \"access to infinite minds.\" The…",

The scene would be unrecognizable without all the indie hits that first found a home on Steam, and early attempts to mimic that plumber in the red hat led to the tech that gave us Doom. So dust off that gamepad and embrace the inherent fun of jumping over stuff with me. It's a genre largely unbeleaguered by big-budget bloat, intent on retaining the purity of old-school action at its best. Platformers remain fascinated with the ability of the videogame to sate a primordial human urge: to run, be free, and soar weightlessly over certain doom. From cerebral puzzle platformers, to parkour simulations, to cotton candy collectathons, the genre is as diverse and worth celebrating as it’s ever been.

Nowadays, movie fans seem much less impressed by CGI in films. There's a general distaste for a perceived overuse of CGI in favor of practical effects, and there are a lot of complaints that recent CGI is less-convincing and more fake-looking than it used to be, even in the biggest budget films. In an interview with But Why Tho? , Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, Rango, and the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, was asked why visual effects in movies just don't look as good as they used to. \"I think the simplest answer is you’ve seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said. \"So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects.

It was a sticky situation for a while: Riot's decision to cancel Hytale and close Hypixel Studios after seven years of work (and for reasons that will probably never be entirely clear) seemed a definitive end to the story, but a seemingly faint hope that someone would step in to save the day became reality when Collins-Laflamme struck a deal to reacquire the whole thing in November 2025.

    "body": "Survival MMO Dune: Awakening has just been patched to version 1.2.40.0, introducing a feature every sleeper has been waiting for: character transfers. You're no longer tied down to the server you created your character on. You can pack up your things and find a new home—just make sure you pack all your things. \"You can now transfer your character, inventory, backed-up bases and vehicles, and bank contents (including your Solari) to a new Sietch and World,\" Funcom announced today . Transfers require a token, which every player has been given, and that token will replenish a week after using it. In other words, you'll get one server transfer per week. Players have been clambering for server transfers for a while now: for some it's because the world they started playing on no longer has enough players and feels like a ghost town, or because one particular faction is dominating the Landsraad, or because their friends have moved onto other games and they're looking for some new blood. It's taken quite a while for this feature to arrive—Dune: Awakening launched way back in June 2025—but it's great that it's finally here. If you're ready to hop to a new Dune, you can transfer your charac…",

How to get azure kelp in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) The best place to find azure kelp is in bodies of water like lakes and rivers in azure forest biomes found in Emerald Grove , the starting zone. These areas have distinctive blue trees, blueish grass (azure, you could say), and you'll often find lots of small ponds or rivers cutting through them. You can easily spot azure forests on your map, so zoom in to check if there's any water before trekking over. Search the bodies of water and you should find azure kelp, a bright blue plant that shimmers and often pokes out of the water. Since it's a plant, press F to harvest it. Breaking it with any tool or even your hands drops azure petals, which aren't what you want in this case. In …",

We've seen plenty of 4K dual-mode monitors before. But thus far, the 1080p alt mode has run at precisely twice the refresh rate of the panel's native 4K setting. But now Asus is launching two new monitors with 1080p modes that run at 3x and 4x the refresh of their respective 4K modes. By way of example, I reviewed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG last summer . That's a 27-inch 4K model that hits 160 Hz at 4K and therefore 320 Hz at 1080p. Now there's a new version of that display, dubbed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG Gen 2. As before, it'll do 160 Hz at 4K, but now hits 480 Hz at 1080p. That latter figure should be enough to satisfy pretty serious esports gamers and in turn allow the XG27UCG Gen 2 to offer the best of both worlds in terms of 4K image detail and 1080p speed. The other newcomer is the Asus TUF Gaming VG27UQEL5A. That's another 27-inch 4K model, but this time with a native 75 Hz 4K mode and a 4x 1080p 300 Hz mode. So, it's actually the 3x model that hits the higher refresh rate. It's just also starting at a much higher base 4K refresh. …",

It reportedly comes with deceptive names like \"Upcoming_Products.pdf\" and has an attached open-source PDF reader app. In many cases, this download would come with an uncompromised RAR file, which might make the parent folder seem real. When the reader boots it up, the file sideloads a malicious DLL file, which is placed in the same directory as legitimate ones. This not only evades detection but makes the downloaded file seem totally genuine as a result. That means one could go some time without realising their PC has been compromised. Once up and running, that malicious DLL file pops a Python interpreter onto the system, which runs a script to create a registry Run key. This ensures that the Python interpreter is active on login to the system, and can even give remote access to the user. From there, bad actors can take information from the machine.

If you're confused on the naming, the Konkr Fit is the one with an AMD chip, Windows operating system, and a larger frame. It comes with a seven-inch OLED screen. The Konkr Pocket Fit is Android-based, smaller, and presumably cheaper, with this model ranging from $299 to $329. The Pocket Fit comes with a six-inch LCD display.

    "body": "After the huge success of the game's launch, Ball X Pit developer Kenny Sun and Friends announced three big updates to come in 2026 . Now the first of the trio has been dated—and we've had a glimpse at what it's set to include. The Regal Update is due January 26, so it's not long to wait at all. It's adding two new characters, eight new balls, \"several\" more passives, and a \"nice surprise we don't want to spoil just yet\"—which all in all seems like a very robust set of features. (Image credit: Kenny Sun) While they don't sound too revolutionary, the two characters seem like fun additions to the roster. The Carouser's power is that when his balls return to him, they spin in a circle around him, which should make him particularly powerful at close range. Meanwhile the Falconer fires her balls from two birds on either side of her, who seem to sit against the walls of the stage and shoot inwards—a bit like a remix of the Cohabitants. The true Ball X Pit fiends among you will already be thinking of possible combos with other character powers. I'm wondering about using the Carouser with the Repentant for quick-returning balls to keep the spinning wheel of death going as much as possible…",

Though I have a Steam backlog many would envy, I'm still hopping between my rig and perhaps far too many consoles. What's a gamer to do? Crack each of those bad boys open and form something like a console Megazord? Well, one Chinese modder has basically done just that. Hong Kong-based tech creator 小宁子 XNZ has built a 3-in-1 console that swaps between a PS5, Xbox Series S, and a Switch 2 at the push of a button (via TechSpot ). It's a project vaguely reminiscent of Origin PC's The Big O , a liquid-cooled desktop with either a PS4 Pro or an Xbox One S console tucked inside, back in 2020. The creator calls her 3-in-1 effort the 'Ningtendo PXBOX 5,' and it turns out this hunk of hardware was no easy thing to create. Rather than simply strapping all of the hardware together (which the YouTuber demonstrates would be both unwieldy and weigh a hefty 10 kg), she stripped everything down to its electrical components and completely rethought the hardware's housing. Don't worry, no motherboards were folded ' like a book ' or otherwise harmed during this project. Noticing that individual PSUs and cooling …",

And to be fair, the actual sketch looks cool as hell—not exactly the Lara we know today, mind, but something that wouldn't be out of place as a Street Fighter character, or a member of Final Fantasy 7's party. The example 3D render in that very same scan is, uh, not what I'd call good. Uncanny, haunting eyes that catch none of the sketches' original charm, peering straight into the soul, as though they know all my sins. Like something that belongs in an analog horror video from the late 2000s. These images also cropped up in a 2021 X post by co-creator Paul Douglas, who writes: \"Quite late in TR1 development, Victor (Core's publisher in Japan) decided our western character design wouldn't go down well there.

I've even seen people recreate all sorts of characters: Link, Jinx, Aang, Beast Boy, the list goes on. So why then does Hytale's very generic-looking metal armour completely cover it up? Getting armour is one of the very first things you'll want to do, too, so you look fabulous for all of five minutes, and then you end up looking like everyone else. Where's the fun in that? It's even more baffling since all of the bonus items packaged with the more expensive versions of Hytale include new cosmetics. You could spend $83.99 to get a ninja costume, a forest fairy outfit, wizard robes, or even a pop star set, only to have it obscured by boring ol' metal plate. Thankfully, that won't be the case for much longer. Hytale Update 2, which arrives in pre-release testing sometime this week, will add the ability to hide your helmet and armour.
