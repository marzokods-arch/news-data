The division of Universal Music Group (UMG) focused on Latin artists and culture — whose high-profile artists include J Balvin , Karol G , Xavi and Ivan Cornejo — has slowly but surely become a front-runner since Seroussi launched it six years ago, ending 2024 as Billboard ’s No. 3 top Latin label and continuing the trek in 2025 on multiple fronts. “From the continued success of global stars like Karol G and J Balvin, to helping drive the next wave of música mexicana with the genre’s new leaders like Ivan Cornejo, Xavi and Gabito Ballesteros , to seeing tremendous growth in international markets like Spain, where artists like Bad Gyal and Judeline are really making an impact — it’s been a standout year,” Seroussi says …",
