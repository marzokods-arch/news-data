The Grammy-winning singer revealed in a statement posted to his social media accounts that his doctor found cancer in one of his lungs, and he&#8217;ll be postponing his January concerts for treatment. &#8220;As many of you know, I recently went through six weeks of bronchitis followed by a relapse of another five weeks. Even though I was over the bronchitis and back on stage at the Westgate Las Vegas, my wonderful doctor ordered an MRI just to make sure that everything was OK,&#8221; Manilow, 82, began. &#8220;The MRI discovered a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed. It&#8217;s pure luck (and a great doctor) that it was found so early. That&#8217;s the good news.&#8221; He added that now his Christmas shows are done, he is undergoing surgery to have the cancer removed. &#8220;The doctors do not believe it has spread and I&#8217;m taking tests to confirm their diagnosis,&#8221; he shared. &#8220;So, that&#8217;s it.

The story of the holiday is often referred to by the poem&#8217;s most famous first line: &#8220;&#8216;Twas the night before Christmas.&#8221; Hetfield&#8217;s version debuted on Friday (Dec. 19) on the band&#8217;s Maximum Metallia SiriusXM channel and then migrated to the band&#8217;s Instagram page, where it was accompanied by a cartoon image of a crackling fire. The group members&#8217; stockings were, of course, hung with care, one for drummer Lars Ulrich, another for Hetfield, as well as ones for bassist Robert Trujillo and guitarist Kirk Hammett.

An experimental Switch-style overlay menu and improved graphics handling stand out in the update. Android, macOS, and less common devices, such as Chromebooks, now receive better or expanded support. The Eden Switch emulator has just pushed out another substantial update, though extensive as it is, this one focuses on evolution rather than revolution. Version 0.0.4 is now live, bringing performance enhancements, game fixes, and expanded device support across Android, PC , and macOS. As detailed in the GitHub changelog , there is at least one new feature of Eden v0.0.4 you’ll probably notice right away. It now has an experimental overlay menu that works a bit like the real Switch. Once enabled, holding the Home button brings it up, making it feel more natural to jump into system-style options than to back out to the main app every time.",

We previously saw that this feature was in development in July, and it’s now rolling out broadly. Google’s made it even easier to find pictures of people in the Google Photos app. Photos has always offered an optional feature called Face Groups that groups similar faces together, creating automatically updating albums of all your pictures of any given person or pet, and today, Google announced that that feature is being more directly integrated into the app’s search functions. The change was quietly announced this morning by Google in a help forum post. Now, if you have Face Groups enabled, both Ask Photos and the app’s “classic search” feature prominently display a row of faces. Tapping any of the pictures in that row will take you to all the photos you have of that person or pet. We first caught a glimpse of this feature in an APK teardown back in July, and today, the change seems to be rolling out broadly.",

Early models, like the first Razer Kishi, folded up into a smallish square, but newer models all have the same H-shaped design that doesn’t pack up nearly as neatly. As my bag has slowly filled up with coloring books, crayons, cards, and other things to keep my kids entertained, bag space has increasingly come at a premium.

Early-bird pricing doesn’t usually disappear mid-preorder, but that’s what’s just happened with the Retroid Pocket 6. In a not-unfamiliar state of affairs for the industry, the company confirmed that it ended the RP6’s discounted pre-order pricing earlier than planned, citing a sharp increase in RAM costs. In a post on X , Retroid said it had intended to keep the Early Bird price through January. However, it has already burned through its initial memory supply, and replenishing stock now means paying “significantly higher prices.” With that, the company somewhat apologetically states it can’t sustain the discount.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung is purportedly pushing the Galaxy S26 Unpacked event to February 2026. You likely won’t be able to buy the phone until March. That would end the recent January streak set by the Galaxy S24 and S25, likely pushing the launch closer to MWC. For years, Galaxy S flagships have followed a fairly predictable early-year playbook. Now, a new rumor suggests the Galaxy S26 might change things not just in terms of its reveal, but also when you’ll be able to buy it. According to a new post on X by well-known leaker @UniverseIce, Samsung may move the Galaxy Unpacked event to February 2026.",

The updated media UI adds visual flair to the playback interface but hasn’t rolled out publicly yet. The change is part of a broader effort to standardize the media playback experience on Android Auto. Android Auto has been working on several changes in the pipeline for media apps. We’ve seen the likes of Spotify and YouTube Music test out the new Media Playback template , giving them a consistent look and experience. Google has also been working on making it easier to switch between different music apps . While we wait for these changes to go live, you can add another upcoming change to the list: Material 3 Expressive-style wavy progress bar!

It can use your location, routine, or other activity to suggest usual tasks. The feature is currently in testing and available only to a small set of users. With the recently launched Pixel 10, Google introduced Magic Cue to simplify how we use our phones. The feature is designed to offer us personalized, context-based suggestions or app actions within supported apps. Although it has been limited to the Pixel 10 series — and has failed to amaze us as it should have — since launch, Google may be cooking up something similar, albeit toned down and more generalized, for all other Android devices. We’ve learned that Google is working on something called Contextual Suggestions , which offer “helpful suggestions from apps and services based on their routine activities and locations.” The feature’s description also includes a relevant example: your usual workout playlist in your preferred music app boots up automatically when you arrive at the gym.",

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority There are plenty of mixed opinions on AI’s potential benefits and harms , but I’ll admit I’ve been somewhat hooked on it from day one. I tend to dive deep into subjects with AI for short bursts that might last hours or on-and-off for a few days, and then drift away for weeks or more when life gets busy with things that are obviously more important. Slowly but surely, though, I realized I was doing less and less when it came to other personal interests. While my AI use never disrupted my real-life obligations or relationships, it was starting to cannibalize my hobbies. Recently, I started scrolling through my massive ChatGPT log entries. Some were simple entertainment, and others were deep thoughts that frankly got a bit heavy. There were more interactions than I’d ever care to count. That’s when the thought hit me: “Has this become my new doom scroll?” I started wondering how I got to that point, how much time I was wasting, and why it felt so addictive. Eventually, I took a deeper look at my AI usage patterns and then took a step back.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority OnePlus typically launches its flagship with an R-branded companion. The latter is characterized by slightly less impactful specifications, including a relatively dull display, a less appealing camera, or a generation-old processor. This year, however, the OnePlus 15R has earned a separate launch, independent of the OnePlus 15 ‘s shadow. That’s because the gap between the two phones is closing, as they share several features on their spec sheets, and these similarities help elevate the OnePlus 15R closer to the status of a flagship Android phone — even though it’s still a flagship-killer at heart . My colleague Joe Maring reviewed the OnePlus 15R and wasn’t quite convinced it is the appropriate update to the 13R, especially given the downgraded cameras, OxygenOS 16’s shift towards an iOS-like aesthetic, and a $100 price bump. While I don’t disagree, I view the OnePlus 15R as packing all the essential bits from the flagship 15, especially for those craving performance and longevity. And if you’re not looking for the swankiest of features, the OnePlus 15R may be worth your consideration.",

    "body": "With the release of Android 12 back in 2021, Google made a somewhat controversial change to the Quick Settings panel. Gone were the individual toggles for Wi-Fi and mobile data. In their place was a new, expandable Internet tile that housed the old mobile data and Wi-Fi toggles. The change aimed to simplify things for users, but it had the side effect of making it more tedious to toggle Wi-Fi and mobile data. Years after rolling out this change, though, Google may be on the verge of reversing it in a future update to Android 16 .

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Android 16’s first major update made me fall back in love with Quick Settings. After Android 12 took away the smaller toggles and switched to the large pill-shaped buttons in the name of Material You, I started using Quick Settings less and less. See, any time a button is hidden away from my eyes and requires more than one or two swipes or taps, I just forget it exists. And this is what happened for me with Quick Settings on Android 12 to 15; I set up the ones I used the most up front and forgot about the rest. Android 16 QPR1 brought the ability to collapse each large pill into half its size and thus fit more toggles on one screen, and that’s what I immediately did. I now had more space to try new things with Quick Settings, like launch apps or start actions inside apps, but I blanked out for a while, not finding the right way to use the extra space. That is, until I realized that the action I needed the most is to control my smart home in general, and my standing desk in particular.",

Don’t get me wrong, Samsung phones are made in both of these countries, but the devil is in the details.

Samsung’s next in-house flagship mobile processor, the Exynos 2600 , was just officially announced as the world’s first smartphone chip built using the 2nm Gate-All-Around (GAA) manufacturing process. It’s rumored to be powering select Samsung Galaxy S26 models in some global markets, but there may be another upcoming Samsung flagship using the chip. The Samsung Exynos 2600 might also power the Galaxy Z Flip 8, according to a new report. As reported by The Bell , Samsung could use the Exynos 2600 chip in the Galaxy Z Flip 8, which is set to arrive next summer (via 9to5Google ). The report cites unnamed industry sources, and says that Samsung is considering the Exynos 2600 for its next flip phone — nothing has been decided yet.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Lenovo might release a new variant of its Legion Go 2 gaming handheld. Instead of Windows 11 or an ROG Ally-style Xbox interface, this Legion Go 2 version is expected to run SteamOS. SteamOS is likely to improve users’ experience with better power management and a console-like interface. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 gaming handheld was first showcased at the CES 2025 conference, but it didn’t make it to the market as late as the October. So, an upgraded version makes little sense. However, Lenovo may be looking to expand options for potential buyers by offering another variant that runs SteamOS instead of Windows. As per a recent leak, Lenovo may be gearing up to reveal this new variant of the Legion Go 2 at CES 2026, exactly a year after the first reveal. Windows Latest says the step to introduce a new variant stems from the unoptimized Windows experience on the small screen. While Lenovo had the option to choose the Xbox full-screen experience (FSE) , as did with the 2025 variants of ASUS ROG Ally and Ally X. However, it appears to have gone with SteamOS for its advantages, including lower hardware requirements, better power management,…",

YouTube says the change is meant to make it more straightforward to tune Shorts recommendations. Along with almost every other element of the platform, YouTube has been tinkering with how feedback works on Shorts for a while. The experimenting continues, and some viewers are about to see another switch-up. This time, YouTube is testing a new take on the Dislike button that affects both its placement and exact meaning. In a post on the Google Support forums , YouTube says it’s experimenting with folding “Dislike” and “Not interested” into a single thumbs-down option for Shorts. Rather than sitting on the main video UI, the button will now be tucked away behind the three-dot menu. Depending on the test group, it may appear as “Dislike” or “Not interested,” but the action itself remains the same.",

But my colleagues’ initial reactions to the phone shook that conviction. In their initial testing, my colleague Robert Triggs found the new phone running at nearly scorching temperatures . That’s a good thing if you’re near the North Pole, helping Santa pack gifts for kids. But for the rest of us mere mortals, those temperatures — I’m talking about nearly 53°C (127°F) on the surface, were bothersome, and especially harrowing for mobile gamers who intend to use it for several dozen minutes, if not hours, holding the phone in their hands while fragging foes in leading FPS games.",

The Galaxy Z TriFold is attracting all the proper attention this year, but Samsung has its task cut out for next year.

The issue has apparently existed for over a year, and Google has acknowledged it, but hasn’t fixed it. The Google Pixel devices are intended to be a role model for the ideal Android experience.

    "body": "TL;DR Android 16 QPR3 is set to introduce support for the newly released Unicode 17.0 standard and its emoji. The update includes 163 new characters, featuring additions like a distorted face, fight cloud, and orca. You can view these new emoji right now if you install the Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 on a compatible Pixel. Emoji play a core role in how people communicate online, allowing us to express ourselves with playful images and symbols rather than just text. New emoji arrive each year to expand our expressive range, and to ensure they appear correctly on everyone’s device, regardless of the platform, they are codified in the Unicode standard. The latest version — Unicode 17.0 — dropped on September 9, 2025, introducing over 160 new characters. While the stable release of Android doesn’t support them yet, that is set to change with next year’s third quarterly release of Android 16 . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
