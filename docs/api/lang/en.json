This color has received a negative reception online along with claims that Samsung is copying Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro phones. We’d suggest you take this leak with a major helping of salt, though. Update: October 8, 2025 (9:22 AM ET): It sounds like the source of this image is more nebulous. Twitter user Najiulloh Berdiev , who claims to be the Redditor who first posted the image, stated that he took the picture from a “random X user” who had “many followers.” This tweet was in response to leaker Steve ‘OnLeaks’ Hemmerstoffer saying the image was likely an AI-generated picture. Either way, you should be very skeptical of this picture.",

After a laggard rollout of One UI 7 earlier in the year, Samsung turned the narrative in its favor with the speedy release of its One UI 8 interface . But even with One UI 8 in its initial phases, Samsung is gearing up to dish out another major update with a horde of visual and operational changes. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 is expected to arrive early next year, in line with the company’s usual launch cycle for the new Galaxy S series. However, the beta will kick off much sooner, and SamMobile indicates it could be as soon as next month.",

    "body": "TL;DR The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar released a new update with support for dual-screen emulation. Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is sending notifications prompting users to set up Health Connect, its service for syncing health and fitness data between different apps. These new alerts aim to solve the service’s poor discoverability, as many users are unaware that Health Connect exists on their phones. The prompts come as Google prepares to expand the platform with new features, such as native step tracking in an upcoming Android update. There are many excellent health and fitness trackers on the market, most of which have their own apps for viewing the data they collect. If you have a fitness band from brand A, a treadmill from brand B, and a digital scale from brand C, getting a holistic view of your health and wellness data can be a messy process. To make it easier for these apps to share data, Google created the Health Connect service back in 2022. Although the number of compatible apps and its feature set have grown steadily since its debut, many people still don’t know it exists. That’s why Google is sending alerts prompting users to connect their apps to Health Connect. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This integration enables you to locate information within documents and presentations, and allows you to add the parent file as a source. The update appears to have been rolled out quietly, as there’s no official announcement from Google. NotebookLM is one of the best and most practical applications of AI for average users like you and me . Since it only uses the sources you provide, it doesn’t hallucinate like other AI tools, making it ideal for productivity , studies , or even just daily life (we use it for our internal documentation here at Android Authority ). You can ask NotebookLM a question and get a precise answer straight from your documentation. But what if you can’t locate specific documents that you want to add? NotebookLM has a Discover Sources feature that searches the web for you, and it seems Google has quietly added a new option for scouring through your Google Drive as well.

There’s no shortage of quality emulators on Android today, allowing you to run everything from NES and PlayStation 3 games to PC titles. But what if you want to run an Xbox 360 emulator on your Android phone ? There is one project in the pipeline, but enterprising users have tried one extreme solution in recent months. The Winlator and GameHub apps let you run PC games and apps on Android, but a few users have also installed the Xenia emulator for PC via these apps so they can play Xbox 360 games on their phones. In other words, they’re effectively running an emulator inside an emulator.",

It’s been four years since Google launched a new Nest Hub. The most recent one — Nest Hub (2nd Gen) — came out in 2021, and since then, we haven’t seen a true-blue smart display from Google. This is also partially because in 2023, Google launched the Pixel Tablet, which doubles up as a smart home display when docked. However, even when Google introduced its tablet refresh, the company never explicitly said that it’s killing off the Nest hub line. Now, it looks like we may finally have some clarity on the future of Nest Hubs and how Google is thinking about them.",

The feature works by changing the browser’s user agent when connected to an external display, so sites don’t load their mobile layouts by default. This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.

We’ve uncovered evidence of Nano Banana preparations in Google Lens and Circle to Search. The Lens integration appears slightly further along, and mirrors what we’ve already seen from Search AI Mode. Nano Banana might be the best thing to happen to Google’s AI offerings in a while, and over the last few weeks we’ve had a lot of fun checking out what the system can do — even if it does seem to struggle a little with varying aspect ratios . We’ve already seen hints that Google has big plans for the tool, like integrating Nano Banana with Search AI Mode , and today we’re looking into a few more places where Nano Banana appears to be getting ready to make an appearance.

From a practical standpoint, though, the first thing I looked at was the power supply of the speaker, and I was immediately disappointed. Once again, Google has gone the DC power plug route for its speaker, eschewing the more universal USB-C format. I’m tired of having to find a spare wall outlet for Google’s speakers, especially when these are marketed as a nice accessory for most rooms in the home. I don’t have a spare wall outlet in every room, and I find it silly that Google has gone for DC barrel power once again.",
