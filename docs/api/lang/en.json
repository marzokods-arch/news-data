During the opening number, their 1987 hit “Welcome to the Jungle” at Estadio Huracán, Rose was visibly frustrated, kicking the bass drum, hurling his microphone toward the kit, and storming offstage after stripping off his leather jacket. The abrupt departure stunned the crowd, prompting confusion both in the audience and among his bandmates. Minutes later, Rose returned to the stage and addressed the situation with a terse, “So, I’ll just try and wing this,” before continuing the set. On Tuesday (Oct. 22), the band released a statement via social media explaining the cause of the disruption. According to the post, the issue stemmed from an in-ear monitor malfunction. “During the opening song at our recent Buenos Aires concert, Axl’s in-ear monitor pack had only the percussion in his ears versus his entire mix,” the statement read. “The issue was fixed by our tech team by the third song, and we had a great night. The situation had nothing to do with Isaac Carpenter’s playing, who is top-notch and a great drummer.” Ferrer’s “amicable” …",

I am the hollow man, fill me up with information and I’ll write it down. What do you sing when your song&#8217;s been sung?&#8221; After hearing the demo, Springsteen called Bon Jovi the next morning. “He says, ‘I can’t get that one out of my head,’” Bon Jovi recalled. “Now you know, you’re talking to not only your childhood hero but one of the great American songwriters of the last half century.” The Boss later agreed to lend his signature harmonica sound to the track. “I want it to be like that.
