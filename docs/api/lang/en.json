Last autumn, six months after beginning her solo career, the singer and Little Mix member pretty much resigned herself to life as a recluse, spending the majority of her time in her Cheshire house. Travelling to London for work would trigger her agoraphobia – an anxiety disorder characterised by a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult – so her home recording space, named Studio 22, became a hideout whenever she felt overwhelmed. In April 2024, the singer (known mononymously as Perrie) released her strident debut single “Forget About Us,” which was co-written by Ed Sheeran, and hit No. 10 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart . From an outside perspective, as the summer rolled on, it seemed as though things were in motion: she was active on social media and delivered a series of radio appearances, including a set at Wembley Stadium as part of Capital’s Summertime Ball, delivering a viral powerhouse cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” All the while, things began to unravel behind the scenes.

YouTube offers probably the deepest video content well in the history of entertainment, and with such a massive library to draw from, not all of that content’s going to be appropriate for everyone.

Most recently, those efforts have taken the form of attempts to verify users’ ages, and right now it looks like enforcement is stepping up. Google announced this past summer that it would start targeting US YouTube viewers with these age checks , using multiple data points to try to automatically characterize users based on things like viewing history.

NASA is helping communities across the nation foresee and prepare for what can follow: mudslides, flash flooding, and contaminated surface water supplies. A new online tool called HydroFlame , built with support from NASA’s Earth Science Division, relies on satellite data, hydrologic modeling, and artificial intelligence to predict how wildfires could affect water resources, from tap water to the rivers and streams where people fish. The project is being developed with the University of Texas at Arlington, Purdue University, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other partners.

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon says early 6G devices could arrive “as early as 2028.” Amon and others expect 6G to play a key role in a future where AI is deeply ingrained in daily life. We’ve come to expect 5G connectivity and the high data speeds that it enables as standard features over the past few years. Naturally, that means we’re also looking forward to the next big thing in mobile connectivity: 6G. Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

OnePlus is the only other brand to score more votes than Samsung die-hards who refuse to try other phones. Loyalty will only take you so far in life, and while we still value it enormously when it comes to personal and professional relationships, are you really doing yourself any favors by remaining ceaselessly loyal to a big, faceless smartphone conglomerate? Sure, if one manufacturer keeps knocking it out of the park, year after year, we’re definitely going to want to check out their latest offerings — but if that’s the only brand you pay attention to, you risk doing yourself a major disservice. Among companies making and selling Android phones, Samsung’s held a prominent spot for years, and to a distressingly large number of users, “Android” might as well be synonymous with “Galaxy.” But even with so many users turning to Samsung phones every time they’re shopping for a new handset, could we maybe convince some of you to see if the grass is any greener in another OEM’s pasture?",

That’s why tablets make for great secondary devices, but choosing the right one can be a challenge. For years, I’ve been on the “bigger is better” train, using Android tablets with 11-inch or larger screens. But after recently trying a smaller, iPad Mini-sized Android tablet, I’ve started to question why I ever liked the larger models in the first place. The appeal of larger Android tablets is obvious: their large, vibrant screens make watching videos and playing games incredibly immersive. Media consumption is their forte, and no other product category does it better. However, few people want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just for media, which is why so many companies try to position their tablets as laptop replacements. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things.

Xiaomi’s T series has generally ticked the right boxes for what makes a good smartphone, but it’s always lacked that one extra feature to make it exciting. The new Xiaomi 15T is a great device with solid all-around specs and some welcome generational improvements, like a better telephoto lens, a bigger battery, and a larger display.

This loss didn’t affect me too severely — I don’t own a Pixel 10, but I craved a similar feature, albeit with a few more customizations.

This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

This could pave the way for future Chromebooks and even a Pixel Laptop powered by Android. Google may have just dropped its clearest hint yet that Android will soon power more than phones and tablets. At today’s Snapdragon Summit kickoff, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google’s SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh discussed a new joint project that will directly impact personal computing. “In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,” Osterloh said on stage . “We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.”",

The aggressive shift risks alienating both customers and employees if the app experience falls short. Just yesterday, we learned that T-Mobile’s current CEO will be stepping down in November, signaling a shift to an AI-centric, digital-first future. At the time, I suggested this would likely mean customer service would move further away from retail, as well as human reps. Now, a new leak on Reddit suggests this ramp-up is coming sooner rather than later. According to an internal roadmap released by a disgruntled salesperson, nearly 100% of major customer service actions will be handled through the T Life app by the end of 2026.

The Pixel 10 Pro spot, on the other hand, is far more ethereal, and is more about making an impression. Google does a lot of things very, very well, but you don’t have to be an iPhone fanboy to recognize that Apple is just running circles around the company when it comes to promotional efforts. Even at their best, Pixel ads tend to come across as quite odd, as we saw with the recent series of stop-motion “Best Phones Forever” spots surrounding the Pixel 10 ‘s launch. Now Google’s starting off this week with a couple new videos and they are just as weird as we’ve come to expect. The most stylistic, and arguably the more interesting ad here focuses on the Pixel 10 Pro and is at least ostensibly about the handset’s design:",

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR The upcoming Xiaomi 17 series will support 100W USB PD PPS charging, a universal standard for fast charging. Xiaomi has explicitly confirmed that users will no longer need proprietary chargers and cables for the fastest charging speeds. The move could pressure other Android manufacturers to abandon their own proprietary fast charging solutions and adopt universal standards. USB Power Delivery promised to be the holy grail of smartphone charging, but several Android OEMs chose to abandon the standard in favor of their own proprietary solutions for fast charging. Many Android flagships claim charging speeds as high as 100W-120W, but the fine print is that you need the proprietary charger to get those speeds. This trend could soon be a thing of the past, as a few upcoming Android flagships are confirmed to support 100W USB PD PPS charging. Xiaomi has confirmed that the upcoming Xiaomi 17 series is fully compatible with 100W PPS charging.",

If you like the idea of browsing the Play Store for new apps, but often get overwhelmed with how to start searching, these updates could actually be pretty helpful. We’ll start with the updates to curated spaces. Spaces live at the top of the Apps tab in the Play Store (next to For You, Top charts, etc.) and are curated collections of apps around a specific topic. Google first started testing spaces last year in India and Japan with its Cricket Hub and Comics spaces, respectively.",

These apps handle things like syncing health data to pushing firmware updates, so if HeyTap is walking away from US accounts, what happens to the OnePlus app data next?

The same version also refreshes the Weather app’s navigation buttons, borrowing design cues from iOS. Samsung Weather gives you most of the staples you expect from that type of app , like temperature, UV index, and so on. However, one notable omission of late has been pollen counts. For some reason, Samsung decided to get rid of the pollen tracker back in the One UI 7 days. Allergy sufferers quickly noticed the loss, as disgruntled posts on Reddit and Samsung’s own forums attest. At best, people could still dig into Weather.com through a buried link at the bottom of the app, but the dedicated pollen cards were gone. It looks like that might be about to change.

Now, the winds of change have returned, with T-Mobile announcing that Sievert will step down on November 1, moving to the role of vice chairman. The last time T-Mobile changed leadership, the company’s identity shifted significantly. Whether the next CEO will bring similar shakeups or a more subtle transition remains to be seen. What is known is who will take the reins and the general direction T-Mobile says it will pursue.",

The audio device has a feature called the “energy slider.” It’s currently unknown what this slider does. Nothing’s sub-brand, CMF, began teasing its first-ever pair of headphones last week. Called the Headphone Pro , there’s not much known about the device yet, other than you’ll be able to customize it with different earpad colors. With the launch only a week away, the company has now shared a new detail about its upcoming audio product. Similar to Nothing’s Headphone 1 , the CMF Headphone Pro will have an assortment of differently-shaped buttons and controls. Among those controls is a feature that looks a lot like a volume slider. However, it appears this slider may not be for controlling volume, as the company calls the feature an “energy slider.”",

One UI 6 introduced Auto Blocker to Samsung Galaxy devices to keep users safe from various security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks. Users can block app installation from unauthorized sources, block commands and software updates through a USB cable, and even block malware images in messaging apps. It’s a good feature for the broader consumer base, but Auto Blocker can be annoying for enthusiasts since it blocks app sideloading . As a result, many power users choose to disable Auto Blocker entirely, which isn’t ideal.

Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch.
