    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile is reportedly running a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer (Promo R339) that began on October 2 and includes many older Android and iPhone models. The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn’t listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer.",

Original article, October 3, 2025 (11:04 AM ET): You’d be forgiven for wincing a little anytime you see the name of one of your favorite streaming services pop in a news feed, as how often is it good news? If it’s not upcoming shows being shelved over fears of upsetting just the worst people, it’s news of price hike after price hike driving up your monthly bills.

Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

    "body": "Samsung took a swing at the thin-and-light smartphones category with the Galaxy S25 Edge , releasing the phone before Apple could release the iPhone Air . Shockingly, mere five months after its launch, reports suggest that Samsung has killed the Edge line . That means no further production of the Galaxy S25 Edge beyond existing stock, and no plans to launch its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge. One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August. Even the lowest-selling S25 Plus sold many times more than the Edge, but with the advantage of having launched earlier in the year.",

In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design. At the same time, certain outliers, like Nothing, challenge that notion by experimenting with unusual camera designs , secondary displays , and unusually tiny screens . Now, another leading Android manufacturer is experimenting with a subtle change that can radically alter the phone’s look by altering how the camera appears.

I highly rate the Find X8 Pro — my current daily driver — in no small part for its stunning pictures. But OPPO plans to take things up a gear this year with a new 200-megapixel telephoto camera, co-developed with Hasselblad once again. The company also has a Hasselblad telephoto extender lens that takes the 200MP camera’s 3.3x zoom / 70mm focal length and blasts it up to a longer-range 9.6x zoom with an equivalent 230mm focal length.

We’re now seeing in action a “Spatial” tab with media suitable for XR headsets. It is also testing a “Go immersive” option, which may be used to cast images to the headset directly from your phone or convert 2D images into 3D. Google’s Android XR platform is set for its big debut, with Samsung’s Project Moohan, aka Galaxy XR , likely to be the first headset to feature the interface. Ahead of the release, Google can be seen tailoring standard Android apps to run in the expansive realm. Photos, Google’s suggested app for storing all media, especially what you capture yourself, is gearing up to photos and videos on a big canvas.

The N64 is making a comeback, with two separate FPGA consoles set to arrive soon. The most recent contender, the ModRetro M64, will be playable for the first time at this weekend’s Portland Retro Gaming Expo. Announced via X , this will be the first official look at the M64 hardware. Several key details have been revealed over the past few months, including the fact that it will be capable of running MiSTer cores to emulate other consoles, but the physical hardware design is still a mystery. The announcement includes an illustration of the console, which looks fairly faithful to the original hardware.",

The new Google Search app experiment on Windows looks like a one-stop solution for anyone more invested in Google’s ecosystem than Microsoft’s Copilot efforts. And seeing it in action as a Mac user, I don’t want to admit it, but I’m a bit jealous.

In its latest collaboration with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss, Nothing takes a closer look at what it truly costs to build a new operating system from the ground up. The video, which aimed to create a custom OS for Arun Maini, breaks down every stage of the process, from planning to deployment, and reveals that developing a fully functional mobile OS would cost an eye-watering $40.47 million. As the video highlights, that figure is even higher than the estimated $26 million it would take to produce the hardware of a flagship phone, as shown in the duo’s earlier Dream Phone project .",

A previous report had suggested that Samsung has already resumed development on the Galaxy S26 Plus. Samsung took a giant leap of faith with the Galaxy S25 Edge , a flagship smartphone that was ready to compromise on some core specifications in the pursuit of a thin and light body. The Korean company one-upped Apple before it could launch the iPhone Air , and even several other Android OEMs before they could jump onto the thin-and-light bandwagon. However, it’s no surprise that the Galaxy S25 Edge isn’t selling well, and the latest report out of South Korea indicates that Samsung has already canceled its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge.

The search tool is also getting an update with a new voice search option for hands-free use. When you need to share a photo or video, Android’s Photo Picker lets you do so without granting an app access to your entire media gallery. It uses a simple, two-tab UI to help you selectively share media: the main “Photos” tab displays your images in reverse chronological order, while the “Collections” tab shows any albums you’ve created. However, finding the right image can be difficult if it’s not part of a collection. Fortunately, Google is introducing new features to make it easier.

The company has updated its product FAQs to note that while its Colorsoft screens deliver a “high-quality reading and writing experience,” the black-and-white Kindles, such as the Paperwhite and Scribe, still offer slightly crisper text. As spotted by Good e-Reader , Amazon added near-identical wording to the FAQ pages for both the new Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and the cheaper 16GB Colorsoft model . The company explains that the color layer responsible for bringing illustrations to life also changes the screen’s texture and brightness. If you’re after the sharpest black-and-white reading experience, Amazon suggests checking out its monochrome Kindles instead.",

For example, a navigation app could use Live Updates to show your next turn in a status bar chip, or a food delivery app could use it to tell you that your food is about to be dropped off. There’s a lot of potential ways that apps can use the Live Updates feature, but unfortunately, developers had to wait a bit to actually use it.

Google’s hoping its big Gemini for Home upgrade and new hardware will turn things around, but after so many false starts, we wanted to know if people are willing to wait around for that revival. We polled our readers to find out. My colleague Karandeep Singh expressed his personal views on this recently, making his article the perfect place to run our poll. For his part, he admitted his loyalty to Google Home had finally run out. He explained how years of reliability issues and patchy updates had worn him down, and how learning that Gemini for Home won’t launch in India anytime soon was the final straw.

T-Mobile has announced that that plan is going away in a few weeks, but it’s offering subscribers a pretty decent consolation.

Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last month, and the company is back this month to launch a refresh of the iPad Pro, now with the newer and more powerful M5 processor, alongside Apple’s N1 and C1X chips. Thanks to these upgrades, Apple is doubling down on performance on the most powerful iPad. Android tablets could barely compete with the iPad Pro in terms of pure performance, and with this upgrade, it doesn’t look like any of them stand a chance of usurping the throne.

    "body": "TL;DR The iPhone 18 Pro is reportedly getting a variable aperture main camera, a first for any iPhone. Variable aperture allows cameras to adjust their aperture size dynamically. This enables better low-light performance and sharper focus in good lighting conditions. Apple’s move mirrors an approach pioneered by Samsung in the Galaxy S9 but abandoned afterward, although other Android brands have picked up the baton. The iPhone 17 series has been well-received by customers, and it’s even enough to tempt many Android users into making the switch . Apple has made some meaningful upgrades to the iPhone 17 Pro’s cameras, but Android flagships, especially those from Chinese OEMs, show us that there is still room for significant improvement. It seems Apple is now taking a leaf out of Samsung’s book for the iPhone 18 Pro next year, as it could upgrade the primary camera with a key tech that was first introduced with the Samsung Galaxy S9 in 2018!

Months ago, Kobo CEO Michael Tamblyn teased that a “little hardware surprise” was on the horizon, sparking speculation about what the company might be cooking up. Many Kobo fans guessed correctly that the use of “little” pointed toward a new accessory, with the leading theory being a remote page turner. Now that it’s official, Tamblyn describes the Kobo Remote as an invitation to “lounge deeper” and read longer. In short, the remote offers users more flexibility in reading position.",
