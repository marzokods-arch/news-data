Of the superstar’s 13 career Hot 100 No. 1s, “The Fate of Ophelia” is her third to have led for at least five weeks. It joins “Anti-Hero” (eight weeks, beginning Nov. 5, 2022) and “Blank Space” (seven, Nov. 29, 2014). Meanwhile, following Halloween, Michael Jackson posthumously makes history on the Hot 100 as “Thriller” blasts from No. 32 to No. 10. With the song, which hit No. 4 in 1984, the late King of Pop becomes the first artist ever to rank in the top 10 in six distinct decades (the ‘70s, ‘80s, ‘90s, 2000s, ‘10s and now ‘20s). Check out the full rundown of this week’s Hot 100 top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations.
