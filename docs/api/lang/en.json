    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR According to a new rumor, T-Mobile stores have a nationwide meeting set for November 23 that is described by an employee as being about “something big,” but details are unclear. While Verizon’s rumored meeting this month may talk about employee layoffs, it’s less clear about the intentions for this meeting. The timing may just align with T-Mobile’s usual pre–holiday sales prep, discussing promotions, goals, or new initiatives like the T-Mobile credit card or T-Life rollout. Earlier this week, there were rumors that Verizon might be announcing some big changes later this month, as talks of potential layoffs are in the air. It’s still unclear if there’s any real substance to the claims, but it seems that they aren’t the only carrier with rumored changes ahead. As first reported by Visible-Bonus-9387 via Reddit , it seems T-Mobile stores around the country are set for a big meeting on November 23. According to the employee, it will be about “something big”.

Representing Team Niall, the Mississippi-born singer leaned into the classic 1996 ballad’s rich heritage and signature yodels, aiming to evoke the same impact Rimes had when she first hit the charts at just 13. Clark’s interpretation kept things classic while still highlighting her own vocal colour and delivery, earning her a wave of praise from coaches Reba McEntire, Snoop Dogg, and Michael Bublé. “Kayleigh, that was wonderful,” McEntire said after the performance. “Your yodels were really, really perfect.” Ahead of the performance, Clark received guidance from “mega mentor” Joe Walsh (Eagles), who advised her to trust her breath control and not be intimidated by the climactic high notes. That note paid off. Clark’s delivery was confident, polished and emotionally resonant — drawing clear comparisons to early-2000s country stars while asserting her place as a rising voice in the genre. Still, it was a tough matchup. Clark was p…",

For some previous winners – like Alt-J (2012) and Antony and The Johnsons (2015) – the money has covered the expenses of being a touring act, while Badly Drawn Boy (2000) infamously threw the cheque away in the heat of the winning moment (his cash prize was ultimately honored). Now Sam Fender has joined a number of past winners by making a statement and donating the entirety of the cash prize to charity. The Music Venue Trust , a charity that supports grassroots music spaces and the scene as a whole, will be the beneficiary of Fender’s generosity. Fender joins previous winners such as Ms. Dynamite (2002) and M People (1994) who have made public that they donated their cash winnings to causes close to their hearts.

Last week’s reports revealed that Apple will pay Google around $1 billion a year for a custom-built Gemini AI model to power the next version of Siri, expected to debut with iOS 26.4 next spring. It’s a huge deal between two rivals, but according to a new report, Apple isn’t planning to draw attention to who’s behind the technology. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says Apple has no plans to publicly acknowledge that Gemini will partly power Siri. Internally, the Gemini-based model is referred to as AFM v10, short for “Apple Foundation Model version 10,” a name chosen to obscure the partnership and avoid confusing staff and customers. Gurman adds that Apple prefers to present it as part of its own system, even though much of the core model isn’t.",

Galaxy Watch users can track their heart rate, calories, and duration in real-time, and some Galaxy devices include up to six months of iFIT free. Samsung Health is getting a serious upgrade. The company is introducing a new partnership with iFIT that brings a library of premium, trainer-led workouts directly into the Samsung Health app. Instead of juggling multiple fitness apps, Galaxy users can now browse guided sessions in the same place they already track their daily steps, sleep, and exercises. It follows Samsung Health’s recent upgrade that added smarter wellness insights and body-tracking tools, making the app feel more like a true fitness hub. This matters because iFIT is known for high-quality, studio-style workout programming. Until now, most of its content lived inside its own app or on connected fitness hardware. With Samsung’s integration, that expertise becomes available to millions of people wit…",

In addition to the card, Samsung is also said to be exploring financial products such as high-yield savings, digital prepaid accounts, and BNPL. One of the significant perks of owning an iPhone is that you walk into a seamless ecosystem of convenience. While many people feel suffocated by the walled garden, others appreciate how easy it makes their lives. For instance, iPhone users in the US can apply for an Apple Card, a credit card that is designed primarily for use with Apple Pay on Apple devices.

There’s a lot to like Credit: Zac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority The feature I love most in Samsung Internet is the split-view mode, along with the sidebar. Split-view puts two tabs side-by-side without having to open a new instance of the tab. The sidebar, as seen in the far right of the image, is a space where you can open a third page in a mobile UI.

    "body": "Many Android apps ask for your current location to show you more relevant results or help with directions, but most don’t need your precise GPS coordinates to do the job. That’s why Android offers two levels of location accuracy: Precise and Approximate. These options are controlled by two different Android permissions and are intended for different kinds of apps. If an app requests a precise location, Android provides the most accurate estimate it can, usually within 3 to 50 meters (about 10 to 164 feet). If an app requests an approximate location, however, Android will only provide a rough estimate of your device’s location, which may only be accurate to within 3 square kilometers (about 1.2 square miles). This is why navigation apps always require your device’s precise location, while most other apps can function perfectly well with either.",

Over the years, most of us of a certain vintage have built our music libraries piece by piece, from rare digital downloads and fan remixes to songs that never made it to streaming platforms. Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option.

That’s the entire purpose of a smartwatch for me.

I’ve always struggled with nutrition tracking. Even though dozens of apps let you log your daily meals, the friction remains. The only wearable that could bridge this wide gap in fitness tracking, I foresee, is smart glasses.

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded .

It appears beta testers are the first users gaining access to the AI assistant. It’s unclear which version of Android Auto Gemini is rolling out on. During an earnings call in April, Google CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed that Gemini would replace Google Assistant in vehicles that connect to phones later in the year.
