This is not new news, of course, but in another banner year for country music it was reinforced when the nominations for the 68 th annual Grammy Awards were announced on Friday morning (Nov. 7). Nowhere is the omission more obvious than in the best new artist category. To be sure, it was an extremely competitive race across several genres — but in a year when nascent country acts like Megan Moroney , Ella Langley and Zach Top were legitimate contenders with commercially and critically acclaimed breakthroughs, their names were nowhere to be found. &nbsp;No country artists made the cut. Looking further in the six general field categories, which, in addition to best new artist, include record, album, song, producer (non-classical) and songwriter ((non-classical) of the year only two country creators made the cut and both for songwriter of the year: Jessie Jo Dillon, who co-wrote songs for artists including Moroney, Jelly Roll ,&nbsp;Russell Dickerson and Morgan Wallen that were released during the eligibility period and Laura Veltz, who had songs cut by BigXthaPlug, Jessie Murph, Josh Ross and Maren Morris, among others.

The company reportedly plans to shut down less-profitable stores and cut staff across remaining locations, while expanding AI automation to fill the gaps. It’s unclear if other big changes will be announced around this time, though it’s possible that there’s more to this coming shift than just layoffs. Last week, I wrote an opinion about the current state of Verizon , as well as some of the moves it might need to make to right the ship. I also mentioned it seemed obvious that store closures would be part of this process and that Verizon’s situation would likely get worse before it got better. It seems this may be happening sooner rather than later, as rumors of imminent closures are flying around on online communities like Reddit and The Layoff. Likewise, a few publications have also picked up on the rumors, such as Phone Arena . Is there any truth to the rumors, and if so, how big a cull are we talking about?

Over the past 24 hours, people who rely on Fitbit’s food database or barcode scanner have been unable to search for new items or scan packaged goods. Favorites and recent entries still appear in the Log Food section, but trying to look up anything new typically results in a blank screen or a “fitbit.com is down for maintenance” pop-up.

Reviews have to be one of the most frustrating-to-navigate components of life online — one that we nonetheless find ourselves returning to time and time again. When you don’t know exactly what the best option for you is just yet, a good user review can really be illuminating. But finding that good one can sometimes require trudging through screens of low-quality submissions, AI slop, and even the work of paid shills. If you’re looking for some help finding the one review that really speaks to your needs, the Google Play Store appears to be working on a tool that might be right up your alley.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max worked fine after charging, despite the other devastating impacts of the natural disaster. While the user’s own survival is what matters, the story again highlights the durability of modern devices, following earlier examples of Android endurance. When Typhoon Kalmaegi tore through the Philippines this week, it left catastrophic damage in its wake. Tragically, many lives were lost, entire homes were destroyed, and communities were left to rebuild from scratch. Amidst the devastation, one Reddit user shared an incredible story of their own survival, as well as that of their iPhone, adding to a growing list of phones that have beaten the survival odds recently.

With an upcoming update, some Pixel Watch users may be able to highlight any concerning deviations in their vitals.

    "body": "TL;DR A noted leaker has contradicted a recent rumor about the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s camera. According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

The search giant has stripped the platform of countless features over the past couple of years, and even some basic voice commands have failed to function like they once did. I’m not alone — hundreds of users have voiced the same complaint about Google Home across social media. Luckily, Gemini looks like it’s on track to revive Google Home’s usefulness but I’m equally concerned that it will introduce problems of its own. Given that I already have Google’s AI Pro subscription , I’m also looking forward to using Gemini Live — the two-way voice conversation feature that won’t require a wakeword every single time. However, after extensively using it on my phone, my excitement levels for the feature’s expansion have been significantly dampened.",

The new Card 5 is even thinner than previous models and supports wireless charging. Google’s Find Hub got off to a rough start, but as time’s gone on, the network has become more useful and we’ve seen a wider variety of tracker hardware. Today, one of the earliest manufacturers of Find Hub trackers, Pebblebee, is selling a couple of new trackers that come with some interesting perks. Pebblebee has started sales of new versions of its Clip and Card trackers. They’re both compatible with Google’s Find Hub as well as Apple Find My, and unlike many previous Pebblebee trackers, neither requires a proprietary charger. They’re also marked with QR codes that let anyone who finds them contact you to return your lost item.",

Samsung’s latest Z Fold 7 moved away from the under-display selfie cameras previous models used. Apple’s first foldable could launch in the second half of 2026. Smartphone manufacturers tend to get ideas from each other. Once Samsung or Google or Apple proves an idea is technically viable and, more importantly, marketable, the other players often move to implement it in their own products. Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display. We first heard that the foldable iPhone would feature an under-display camera by way of a May leak . Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones used similar technology through the Z Fold 6 until switching to a more conventional hole-punch design in the Z Fold 7.

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR The Galaxy S26 might receive notable camera upgrades, even without many changes to the hardware. Samsung is rumored to bring more features to Camera Assistant, an app that unlocks hidden Camera settings on Galaxy phones. Among other features, we could see the option to click pictures at 24MP by default instead of the existing 12MP or 50MP modes. Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series appears to have kept Samsung busier than usual. While the lineup was slated to receive an overhaul with new product names, the changes were reportedly quashed recently, forcing Samsung to return to the older classification . And all this toiling may have contributed to a delayed launch and fewer upgrades to the Galaxy S26 series than we had hoped , especially in the camera department. While the camera itself isn’t receiving any significant upgrades, some of the software features supporting it are expected to improve. One way we can see this improvement is by adding additional camera settings options to Samsung phones through a first-party extension.",

    "body": "Yesterday, Google and Epic finally reached an agreement to settle their years-long legal dispute. If approved by the judge overseeing the case, the settlement would resolve the lawsuit Epic filed in 2020 to challenge Google’s stranglehold on Android app distribution. As part of the agreement, Google plans to make sweeping changes to Android, which will be implemented in a future version of next year’s Android 17 release. The company is developing a new system that will allow users to easily install third-party app stores, reducing the friction of getting apps from outside of Google Play. This timing is notable, as next year is also when Android’s new developer verification requirements will go into effect. Beginning in September 2026, Android will block users from installing apps made by unverified developers. Although Google says that sideloading isn’t going anywhere, some critics are concerned this change will kill alternative app stores like F-Droid . That’s why Google’s agreement with Epic has sparked hope that Android’s sideloading restrictions will be eased or eliminated entirely next year.",

With this change, users will still be able to access their already synced library from YouTube or Google Play, but that may not be forever.

Neither giant is backing down, and the punches won’t stop landing. In a more recent setback, Google is losing access to Movies Anywhere — a digital library management platform that allows you to sync your content from different apps into a single library.

While users can download the Theme packs app today, the features will require another system or server-side update from Google.

Pixel phones might be getting theme packs and prioritized notifications in a future Pixel Drop, and Google is releasing a new app ahead of time. Theme packs were already in the works as of early October, when Android Authority managed to surface a new “Themes” entry in the Settings app on Google Pixel phones. Now, Google published a new “Theme packs” app on the Google Play Store, exclusively for Pixels. Theme packs will make it possible to “personalize your Pixel in one tap,” according to the Play Store listing . “Instantly unlock a complete refresh that updates your wallpaper, icons, sounds, GIFs, and more with seasonal theme packs.”",

    "body": "TL;DR A flag in Android’s Carrier Config Manager allows cellular carriers to artificially inflate the number of bars shown on your phone. Google explains that the majority of carriers require this option, and its addition to the Android codebase dates back to 2017. Android artificially inflates network signal strength to appear as a five-bar scale, rather than the original four-bar scale. Network carriers aren’t afraid to use clever names and marketing to make their cellular performance appear better than it actually is. A prime example is AT&amp;T’s use of the 5GE badge , which is 4G LTE rather than 5G . The truth is, many carriers use similar strategies to market their cellular networks. A flag in the Android codebase that’s recently been getting a lot of attention has led some to believe Google was colluding to artificially inflate signal strength, but the true purpose of the flag appears to be much simpler. A report by Nick vs Networking from last month highlighted a flag named KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL in Android’s Carrier Config Manager. The Carrier Config Manager explains this flag as determining if the Android system “should interpret all signal strength as one bar …",

If you’ve been wondering why Google’s viral image editor ended up with the nickname “Nano Banana,” the mystery’s over. The team says the moniker started life as a throwaway placeholder, and then the internet refused to let it go. On the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast , product lead David Sharon explains that the model’s official name is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. However, when a Product Manager named Nina submitted the model anonymously to the LM Arena benchmark website, allowing users to test it out, she had to enter a temporary label that kept it anonymous. At 2:30 in the morning, “Nano Banana” popped into her head. The next thing they knew, the model had gone viral, and people kept using the playful name, so Google ultimately embraced it in public.",

Verizon reps have given mixed explanations as some cite a system glitch, others blame Apple. There’s no official fix yet, but some users have solved the problem by downgrading from Number Share Plus or toggling plans. Even though it requires an iPhone, there’s no denying that the Apple Watch remains one of the best wearables on the market. If you recently picked up the cellular version of the Apple Watch Series 11 and ran into activation problems, you’re not alone. Verizon and its prepaid partners appear to be experiencing some glitches. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Compared to the Cube, the new model adds Apple HomeKit, Alexa, and Google Assistant support, plus Apple AirPlay for wireless casting. It’s available now on Amazon for $199.99, with a limited-time $50 launch coupon. Today, Aurzen announced the launch of the EAZZE D1R Roku TV Smart Projector, a 1080p Full HD model with the Roku TV platform built in. The device brings streaming, smart-home integration, and Dolby Audio to a budget-friendly package. It builds on Aurzen’s earlier D1R Cube projector with refined features and a lower price point. Aurzen’s earlier D1R Cube introduced Roku’s first projector integration and delivered 1080p resolution, Dolby Audio, and auto-focus and auto-keystone correction at a price of $249. The new EAZZE D1R keeps those hallmarks while adding broader smart-home compatibility, Apple AirPlay casting, and a lower $199 price tag. These upgrades help position the device for a wider mass-market audience.",
