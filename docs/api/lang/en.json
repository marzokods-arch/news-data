Tour de Dance has become Aminé’s most expansive run yet, hitting major festivals and headlining venues across North America and Europe throughout 2024 and 2025. The Australian leg marks the rapper’s first return to the country since 2023 and the fourth visit of his career.

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s own virtual assistant Bixby may soon be powered by an AI chatbot. Samsung is rumored to have partnered with Perplexity, a Google DeepMind and OpenAI rival, for new Bixby capabilities. These features would be available to Samsung users starting with the Galaxy S26. Bixby, Samsung’s homespun virtual assistant , has always been overshadowed by more popular options such as Gemini , Siri, and Alexa. On other smart devices, such as Samsung TVs and talking refrigerators, Bixby is the default voice assistant. However, on Android devices under Samsung’s Galaxy range, Gemini takes precedence over Bibxy, and Samsung doesn’t oppose either. One of the reasons for Bixby’s lack of popularity is the limited AI features compared to its rivals. However, that could be changing soon — as soon as early 2026, when Bixby might receive a deeper integration of Perplexity’s AI chatbot. According to leaker with the handle @chunvn8888 on X , Samsung is testing Perplexity’s integration into Bixby on its smartphones and tablets. The feature, they say, is set to arrive with the launch of the Galaxy S26 series next year.",

Every part of the operating system is designed to monitor citizens, making personal computing virtually impossible. North Korea’s smartphones were never meant to be seen by the outside world, but in a rare deep dive, YouTuber MrWhosetheboss has exposed just how the region and its regime rig devices for surveillance, censorship, and propaganda.",

It’s been a while since I’ve actually struggled to get a modern flagship to start fast charging. Like any normal person, I took my new Find X9 Pro out of the box and tried plugging it into my existing charger setup . That went OK, if not a little slow (more on that later). But I also wanted to compare my desk charger against an official 80W OPPO SuperVOOC plug, so I gave that a try as well.

However, the unexpected news has certainly left many of us scratching our heads. We first suspected the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) had something to do with it, but since Google essentially went rogue and implemented it without Apple’s help , it seems that’s not the case.

That said, it rather forces the user to adopt this ideology. It’s no wonder then that plenty of users leap for other Android launchers offering fresher features and extensive customization options. Fortunately, it appears that Google is addressing this issue. According to evidence we uncovered in Android Canary, the Pixel Launcher will soon give users the option to hide its At a Glance widget completely from the home screen. The widget, positioned right at the top of the screen, is helpful in certain instances. It serves context-relevant information, including weather forecasts, flight details, and traffic information via Maps for commuters. Not everyone values this information, though, and since At a Glance is permanent, it robs these users of real estate on their home screens.",

Eventually, mass-deleting emails and photos to free up cloud storage space took its toll, and soon I found myself paying $2 a month for Google One Basic. That only solved my data cap problems for one Google account; not long after, I shelled out for Google One Premium to share 2TB of cloud storage across all my accounts. Subscriptions can get out of hand quickly, so Google One Premium at $10 per month was all I could muster. Despite owning multiple Nest displays and a Nest Video Doorbell, I stuck with only three hours of event recording to avoid paying another $10 for Nest Aware each month. Plus, my smart home is split between the Apple and Google ecosystems. Paying for Apple One gave me an unlimited number of HomeKit Secure Video (HSV) cameras with a 10-day recording history, making Nest Aware hard to justify.",

    "body": "Credit: Kris Carlon / Android Authority The Fitbit Versa 4 isn’t the latest fitness tracker on the market, but for those seeking a well-rounded wearable, it’s still a solid option. With a Black Friday deal slashing the price by a full 40%, it’s an even more tempting prospect. The $80 price drop reduces it from its $200 retail price to just $119.95 , down from $199.95, and hasn’t been cheaper all year. The Fitbit Versa 4 boasts several attractive features. It has built-in GPS, continuous heart-rate monitoring, and over 40 exercise modes to choose from. It also provides SpO₂ tracking and a Daily Readiness Score, which can be great motivators for any fitness journey.",

    "body": "Opinion post by Adamya Sharma Thank you, thank you so very much, Google! If there was one feature I was truly manifesting for my Pixel 10 Pro (or any Android phone for that matter), it was proper AirDrop support between iPhones, Android devices, Macs, and iPads . As someone who works for an Android website yet also nibbles on the forbidden fruit, I have shed actual tears trying to move files between my Android phone, MacBook, and iPhone. I’m WhatsApping images to myself like it’s 2015, emailing documents like it’s 2007, digging out cables like I’m on a treasure hunt, all for something as basic as transferring files. If it were up to Apple, I and many others like me might never have seen this day. But thanks to Google going delightfully rogue and doing one of the coolest things for Android this year, my hacky file-transfer misery might finally be behind me… at least until Apple decides this tiny moment of cross-platform joy has gone on long enough.",

One thing you also probably thought of for a long, long time was its iconic alert slider — a three-stop switch to go from ring to silent without ever unlocking your phone. Then, that alert slider disappeared. No, not on the OnePlus 15 (yet), but on the OnePlus 10T. The change made exactly nobody happy, so OnePlus brought its slider back. Now, though, it’s gone again, this time from the OnePlus 15 , making it a much more noticeable problem. In its place sits the Plus Key, a multifunctional button with a new AI-powered journal at its disposal, and I don’t like it one bit.",
