The code snippet hints at “Ask” capabilities in Stories, which likely refers to Moments. This comes after Google has aggressively integrated the Ask feature in the Photos app, much to the chagrin of some users. Google introduced Ask functionality in Google Photos in 2024, and the company recently replaced the app’s classic search tool with this AI-driven Ask feature.

    "body": "TL;DR A new Galaxy S26 rumor suggests Samsung might actually upgrade charging speeds on the base variant. Instead of the regular 25W charging, the base Galaxy S26 might support 45W charging. While the rumor had previously been refuted, it has resurfaced, making us wonder whether it’s actually true. The Galaxy S26 series has been one of the most confusing upcoming launches. We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is preparing a new battery-preserving feature that will limit frequent backups. We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",

However, Strava leads the pack in potentially exploiting the most data beyond app functionality. PUSH stood out as the least invasive app of the bunch. It’s the beginning of the new year, which means you and many others may be on a fitness kick right now. Mobile apps, like Fitbit and Nike Training Club, can help you achieve your fitness goals, and there are plenty to choose from. These apps usually require a variety of information to function — like user ID, location, device ID, and crash data — but some of that data tends to be shared with third parties for ad targeting and other purposes. A new report has now laid out which fitness apps are the least privacy-friendly. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Many of us have spent the last couple years learning that modern AI does some things a whole lot better than others. While it sometimes misreports facts, “ hallucinating ” details, it tends to do a pretty decent job at stringing a few words together — even incorrect results don’t end up sounding like gibberish.

The render Android Headlines published today shows a purported Pixel 10a that looks nearly indistinguishable from last year’s Pixel 9a at a glance, though size and layout of the camera cutout, flash, and Google G lettermark are all subtly different.

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has removed its egg-hatching mini-game from the Gaming Hub app for its Android devices. The good news is that all the unlockable characters are now available without any extra effort. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",

After it determined Verizon and AT&amp;T had willfully violated the law by failing to protect customer location data, the FCC previously ordered AT&amp;T and Verizon to pay roughly $57 million and $47 million, respectively.

    "body": "TL;DR Apple finished 2025 as the world’s top smartphone brand in terms of units shipped, extending its lead over Samsung thanks to faster year-on-year growth. Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has been using the same camera sensors on its Galaxy S Ultra devices since 2023. This could change next year with the Galaxy S27 Ultra, slated to feature an upgraded sensor. Latest leak says that while the camera will have the same format, it will pack newer technologies, though details are rife at the moment. Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy S26 series soon, most likely in the last week of February. But even with weeks remaining for one of Samsung’s biggest unveilings of the year, leaks and rumors about Samsung’s next generation of flagships are already gushing in. While Samsung has slept on upgrading the hardware, specifically the camera, over the last few generations of its Galaxy S series phones, the Galaxy S27 Ultra may finally bring some improvements. Last week, we leaned into the possibilities of these upgrades, suggesting that three of the four rear cameras on the Galaxy S27 Ultra could be upgraded to newer sensors . And today, we’re learning a bit more about the primary camera sensor. According to the leaker Ice Universe , the Galaxy S27 Ultra will be stocked with a new camera sensor, which is expected to be called …",

We’ve been hoping for a OnePlus Open 2, but it looks like OnePlus has other ideas. Leaker Yogesh Brar claimed on Twitter that OnePlus has canceled the OnePlus Open 2. This would be disappointing news if confirmed, and means global users would be deprived of what could be a high-quality foldable.",

See, I’m loath to fork out for Google One when I have 10TB of hard drive space on my NAS. Still, I use Google Photos to make the occasional quick edit, to help share snaps with friends and family quickly, and even duplicate a few of my most cherished memories as part of the recommended 3-2-1 backup rule . For storing most of my older snaps, I’ve been using PhotoPrism, but as good as it is as a photo library, it lacks the rich feature set of Photos, especially for managing multiple users in my home.",
