These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

Skywatching Highlights Oct. 6: The October supermoon Oct. 6-10: The Draconid meteor shower Oct. 21: The Orionid meteor shower peaks (full duration Sept. 26 â Nov. 22) Transcript Whatâs Up for October? A Supermoon takes over, the Draconid meteor shower peeks through, and the Orionid meteors sparkle across the night sky. The evening of October 6, look up and be amazed as the full moon is bigger and brighter because â itâs a supermoon! Illustrated infographic showing the difference (as seen from Earth) between perigee, when a supermoon appears, and apogee, when a micromoon appears. NASA/JPL-Caltech This evening, the moon could appear to be about 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than a typical full moon. But why? Supermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon coincides with âperigee,â which is when the moon is at its closest to Earth all month. So this is an exceptioâ¦",

Credits: NASA/Keegan Barber The Sun and Our Lives On a clear night, you might see thousands of stars in the sky. Most of these stars are dozens or hundreds of light years away from us. A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds â¦",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the systemâs star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected â essentially photographed â a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its âprotoâ state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about â¦",
