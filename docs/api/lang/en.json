    "body": "Samsung took a swing at the thin-and-light smartphones category with the Galaxy S25 Edge , releasing the phone before Apple could release the iPhone Air . Shockingly, mere five months after its launch, reports suggest that Samsung has killed the Edge line . That means no further production of the Galaxy S25 Edge beyond existing stock, and no plans to launch its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge. One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August. Even the lowest-selling S25 Plus sold many times more than the Edge, but with the advantage of having launched earlier in the year.",

In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design. At the same time, certain outliers, like Nothing, challenge that notion by experimenting with unusual camera designs , secondary displays , and unusually tiny screens .

Let’s take a quick look at the biggest differences between prepaid and postpaid trade-ins and what to look for if you are interested in prepaid service but want a good trade-in offer. You can get a decent trade-in value, but condition matters much more with prepaid",

According to the report, there will not be a Galaxy S26 Edge. Instead, Samsung will stick to its tried-and-tested lineup of Galaxy S26 (Pro), S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. A previous report had suggested that Samsung has already resumed development on the Galaxy S26 Plus. Samsung took a giant leap of faith with the Galaxy S25 Edge , a flagship smartphone that was ready to compromise on some core specifications in the pursuit of a thin and light body. The Korean company one-upped Apple before it could launch the iPhone Air , and even several other Android OEMs before they could jump onto the thin-and-light bandwagon. However, it’s no surprise that the Galaxy S25 Edge isn’t selling well, and the latest report out of South Korea indicates that Samsung has already canceled its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge.

It packs a 5,000mAh battery, a triple-rear camera setup, 16GB of RAM, and a MediaTek chipset. There’s a lot of talk about de-Googling these days. The movement essentially advocates cutting Google’s access to private information on people’s devices. That’s why many privacy-focused operating systems, like GrapheneOS , are gaining traction among users who want to avoid Google’s tracking and data collection and protect their information from reaching the wrong hands. Now, a new smartphone called the HIROH Phone is promising all those things, and it even adds a hardware kill switch for extra peace of mind.",

The company has updated its product FAQs to note that while its Colorsoft screens deliver a “high-quality reading and writing experience,” the black-and-white Kindles, such as the Paperwhite and Scribe, still offer slightly crisper text. As spotted by Good e-Reader , Amazon added near-identical wording to the FAQ pages for both the new Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and the cheaper 16GB Colorsoft model . The company explains that the color layer responsible for bringing illustrations to life also changes the screen’s texture and brightness. If you’re after the sharpest black-and-white reading experience, Amazon suggests checking out its monochrome Kindles instead.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is updating the Android Easter egg in Android 16 QPR2 to properly showcase the new Live Updates feature. Live Updates allow apps to provide persistent progress updates in the status bar, on the always-on display, and at the top of the notification panel. The feature wasn’t fully ready in Android 16’s initial release, which is why the Easter egg is only now being updated to support it. One of the biggest new features in Android 16 is Live Updates. Live Updates are basically Android’s version of iOS’ Live Activities, and they allow you to quickly get progress updates from applications without stopping whatever you’re doing. For example, a navigation app could use Live Updates to show your next turn in a status bar chip, or a food delivery app could use it to tell you that your food is about to be dropped off. There’s a lot of potential ways that apps can use the Live Updates feature, but unfortunately, developers had to wait a bit to actually use it. That’s because the Live Updates feature wasn’t ready until last month’s Android 16 QPR1 release , which added full support for it. The initial release of Android 16, in contrast, just added support for the new progress-cent…",

A few users say it started after using the Essential Recorder feature, while others noticed it appearing without warning during calls or at a specific time of day.

Google’s hoping its big Gemini for Home upgrade and new hardware will turn things around, but after so many false starts, we wanted to know if people are willing to wait around for that revival. We polled our readers to find out. My colleague Karandeep Singh expressed his personal views on this recently, making his article the perfect place to run our poll. For his part, he admitted his loyalty to Google Home had finally run out. He explained how years of reliability issues and patchy updates had worn him down, and how learning that Gemini for Home won’t launch in India anytime soon was the final straw.

Earlier this month, some Android Auto users noticed that they were no longer able to access the GameSnacks app. There’s now an update on this situation.

T-Mobile has announced that that plan is going away in a few weeks, but it’s offering subscribers a pretty decent consolation. As spotted by The Mobile Report , T-Mobile is ending the JOD program on December 1. But as T-Mobile spells out in support documentation, existing JOD subscribers will get to keep their current device when the plan goes away.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority Picking out the best wall charger for the new Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is not the easiest task, thanks to some quite specific power requirements. Even then, I wasn’t too impressed when testing out Google’s new 67W plug — partly because of some aggressive power throttling to prevent the phone from overheating. This made me wonder if I could just stick with an older adapter and receive pretty much the same charging experience. The thing is, the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s higher 39W power limit is locked behind a rarer 20V PPS charging protocol requirement, meaning most customers are looking at buying (another!) new plug.",

The new DJI Osmo Mobile 8 supports Apple DockKit, enabling subject-tracking features across various video and social media apps. Besides humans, it can now also track pets. DJI is easily one of the top names to crop up when you’re looking for gimbals , and the brand is now rolling out an improved solution for phones. Less than a year after launching the Osmo Mobile 7 and 7P, DJI is introducing a successor with considerable improvements to panning and broader tracking support for apps that justify the update. The newly announced DJI Osmo Mobile 8 integrates or improves upon features from the more premium Osmo Mobile 7P . It now has the same compact profile as before, with an improved hand grip designed specifically for low-angle shots. With the updated model, DJI enhances panning, now supporting 360º rotation, which wasn’t previously possible.",

It features a 4,800 mAh battery with 68W wired and 15W wireless charging support. The phone launches in China first, with a global debut expected soon as the Motorola Edge 70. The race to build ultra-thin smartphones is heating up, with brands like Samsung and Apple already pushing the limits through the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air . Now, Motorola has joined the fight with its latest contender: the Moto X70 Air. Officially unveiled in China just weeks after its first teaser, the X70 Air is one of the slimmest phones the company has ever produced. At only 5.99mm thick and weighing about 159g, it blends style with substance, packing a 4,800mAh battery, Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip, and triple 50MP cameras into a chassis thinner than most flagships. Although pricing has not been announced, the phone is already listed on Lenovo’s official website , with a global debut expected under the “Motorola Edge 70” name.

Evidence for this unreleased feature was discovered in the code of the Google TV Ambient Mode app, though it’s not yet live. When you’re relaxing at home watching a show on your Google TV , interruptions are the last thing you want. Still, a package delivery or a strange sound outside can pull your attention away. That’s why the customizable button on select Google TV remotes is so useful, as it can be configured to open the smart home panel , letting you view a camera feed or control other devices. A future update, however, may take this a step further by letting you bypass the panel to launch your preferred camera feed directly. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

I put our X300 Pro review unit through a series of benchmark tests, and the results are quite disappointing. I need to preface this by saying that vivo has consistently been one of the most disappointing brands when it comes to benchmark tests, particularly stress testing. We saw this play out with the X200 Pro , while the identically equipped OPPO Find X8 Pro fared much better. Nevertheless, we’ll let the figures do the talking here.",

    "body": "TL;DR The iPhone 18 Pro is reportedly getting a variable aperture main camera, a first for any iPhone. Variable aperture allows cameras to adjust their aperture size dynamically. This enables better low-light performance and sharper focus in good lighting conditions. Apple’s move mirrors an approach pioneered by Samsung in the Galaxy S9 but abandoned afterward, although other Android brands have picked up the baton. The iPhone 17 series has been well-received by customers, and it’s even enough to tempt many Android users into making the switch . Apple has made some meaningful upgrades to the iPhone 17 Pro’s cameras, but Android flagships, especially those from Chinese OEMs, show us that there is still room for significant improvement. It seems Apple is now taking a leaf out of Samsung’s book for the iPhone 18 Pro next year, as it could upgrade the primary camera with a key tech that was first introduced with the Samsung Galaxy S9 in 2018!

The company just announced its first-ever page turner, a simple, Bluetooth-powered clicker for readers who prefer to keep both hands buried under their blankets. Months ago, Kobo CEO Michael Tamblyn teased that a “little hardware surprise” was on the horizon, sparking speculation about what the company might be cooking up. Many Kobo fans guessed correctly that the use of “little” pointed toward a new accessory, with the leading theory being a remote page turner. Now that it’s official, Tamblyn describes the Kobo Remote as an invitation to “lounge deeper” and read longer. In short, the remote offers users more flexibility in reading position.",

I have several reasons for this — customization, updates, and AI features are on the list — but my favorite one has always been to hype up the cameras. See, I’ve just always loved the way Google can pull details and colors out of my stills, not to mention the fact that Magic Editor is, well, magic. The problem, though, is that Google has always been just okay when it comes to videos (sorry, Jonas Brothers ). Apple, for its part, has always struggled with the opposite problem — it’s long been the king of video, only to leave me underwhelmed by its photos. Now, though, Apple seems determined to put its stills on par with the best Android camera phones , and I wanted to see if that was really possible. So, I took the iPhone 17 Pro for a busy week around town, and here’s how its camera has shaped up so far.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR YouTube plans to launch AI-generated lip sync to automatically dubbed videos. It may soon start testing the feature in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. The feature may incur additional fees, which will likely have to be borne by users. Whether you like it or not, Google isn’t backing down on its attempts to increase engagement by automatically translating audio into your native tongue. Now, following continuous and unwavering stabs at simply translating audio with autodubbing, YouTube may take it a notch higher with realistic-looking audio dubs with accurate lip sync in an attempt to make videos more appealing with AI . YouTube’s product lead for Auto-dubbing, Buddhika Kottahachchi, recently detailed the technology behind lip-synced autodubs in a conversation with Digital Trends . Kottahachchi informed the publication that the system makes intricate pixel-level changes to modify the speaker’s mouth, ensuring the dub looks realistic.
