Our list is drawn from boxofficemojo.com’s running tally of the 1,000 top-grossing films of all time in terms of worldwide grosses. Grosses for Wicked: For Good have slowed to a trickle in the past couple of weeks, but the film is likely to top $525 million in worldwide grosses this week. Both Wicked: For Good and its predecessor, 2024’s Wicked , were adapted from the 2003 Broadway musical Wicked . The first Wicked film opened on Nov. 22, 2024. In just five weeks, it pulled ahead of Mamma Mia! to become the top-grossing film adapted from a Broadway musical. Wicked received 10 Oscar nominations on Jan. 23, 2025, including nods for both of its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande . It won two awards at the Oscars ceremony on March 2, 2025 — best costume design and best production design. Wicked: For Good was shut out in the nominations that were announced on Thursday Jan. 22.

Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums.

With the AI boom, Google wants to make information accessible without any significant effort, and is extending these principles beyond web search. Last month, it extended the same altruistic virtues to Google Drive, where you now see AI overview-style summaries for your folders . With this change, Google’s AI will look through your folders, any directories within them, the files stored in them, and even the contents of those files, so you can find whatever you’re looking for immediately. These “smart” features in Google Drive are available to all paying Gemini subscribers and Workspace users. Google says it saves time and helps you discover files buried under several layers of folders. But I’m deeply unsettled by Google raking through my files — especially without my explicit consent — and the only solution I feel I have now is to stop trusting Google with anything private.",

The U.S. rock veterans played a sold-out marathon set at UTAS Stadium in Launceston on Saturday (Jan. 24), marking their first Tasmanian performance in more than a decade and their debut concert in the state’s second-largest city. The show, which ran close to three hours, was the band’s only Australian date on the current visit. Late in the set, Grohl addressed the crowd with a major update on the band’s next chapter, confirming that Foo Fighters have recently completed work on a new record. “We might have a whole new record of f***ing songs that we just finished the other day,” Grohl told the audience, delivering the first public confirmation that a follow-up to 2023’s But Here We Are is complete. Grohl also hinted strongly that fans won’t have to wait long to see the band back on Australian soil. “This won’t be the last time you see us,” he said. “We’ll be back here sooner than you think… and it’s before my next birthday.” Grohl’s birthday falls on Jan. 14, suggesting Foo Fighters could return to Australia befor…",

I was once an avid SwiftKey user, opting for the innovative keyboard early in my Android journey over Google’s simpler default option. The allure of the more efficient and sensibly designed Google alternative eventually drew me away as I upgraded to more polished devices.

I use Notion and have spent way too much time just setting up my system within the app, choosing the correct icons, and making sure the colors match across my pages. Because I spent so much time tweaking it, I feel like I have to put it to use, so I try to write down as much as humanly possible to achieve that feeling of being on top of things that matter.

At least he ordered it for professional reasons (I think), but no one who excitedly pre-ordered the T1 phone has seen any sign of it yet. That hasn’t stopped Trump Mobile from thinking about what comes next. According to a company executive, a higher-end “T1 Ultra” may also be in the works. The Verge spotted a largely overlooked interview from November with Trump Mobile executive Don Hendrickson.

These findings place upper bounds on how much water meteorites could have supplied later in Earth’s history. Research has previously shown that meteorites may have been a significant source of Earth’s water as they bombarded our planet early in the solar system’s development. In a paper published Tuesday in the Proceedings to the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Tony Gargano, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Johnson Space Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), both in Houston, used a novel method for analyzing the dusty debris that covers the Moon’s surface called regolith .

A screenshot of the certification (via Huawei Central ) reveals that the foldable has a rated capacity of around 7,000mAh, with a typical capacity of 7,150mAh (2,320mAh + 4,680mAh). It appears the Magic V6 will also have a variant that may have a 6700mAh battery with a typical value of 6850mAh. Original article: January 23, 2026 (11:40 AM ET): This year’s Mobile World Congress (MWC) event is scheduled to take place from March 2 to March 5. Among the various brands that will be at the show, HONOR has confirmed that it will also be in attendance. However, the company won’t be there just to keep an eye on the latest industry trends; it will also be launching a few devices.",

At the time, enabling this look took some tinkering — but now, the new light theme is rolling out publicly in multiple versions of the Photos Android app. The editing view for Google Photos has historically featured a dark gray background. That’s easier on the eyes when using your phone in a dark room, but it might not always be what you want. After an apparent server-side update that’s hitting users this week, that background will match your device theme: dark gray on dark mode, light gray for light mode.",

For many of us, Google Wallet has become the ever-growing storehouse for not just our credit or debit cards but also our passes, IDs, vouchers, and virtually everything else that needs to be conserved digitally. However, as it grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage or sort, which is why Google has been building search functionality for Wallet for quite some time.

Within a few years, my home was filled with smart bulbs, cameras, speakers, switches, and just about anything else that promised automation or voice control. By late 2020, I had mostly abandoned it all. The novelty wore off, the maintenance piled up, and the conveniences no longer felt worth the effort. Now, several years later, I have slowly started to bring smart home tech back into my life. The question is whether the experience has actually improved enough this time to make it stick.",

Epic will pay Google for services; Google gets deeper access to Unreal Engine and will help promote Epic’s products on Android. Judge James Donato questioned if this deal diluted Epic’s fight for broader Android reforms. After years of heated antitrust battles , Google and Epic Games have shocked the tech world with a secret, massive partnership now coming to light. The surprise was revealed during this week’s court hearing, when it emerged that the two rivals had agreed to an $800 million, six-year strategic partnership, The Verge reports. Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney hinted at the news on X , calling it “spicy details from the Epic v. Google settlement hearing!”",

The company has reportedly agreed to cover the cost of the phone, medical bills, and cleanup, and has offered $500 per person for pain and suffering. We’ve verified the user’s claims, including the report from the local fire department and Samsung’s offer. Samsung has also shared a statement with Android Authority, stating that its analysis concluded that external force was the cause of the incident. Update: January 23, 2025 (1:36 AM ET): Samsung has now shared an amended statement with us, attributing the incident to “external force.” Since the fire department’s investigation concluded that a thermal runaway event occurred, and per the user’s testimony, the phone was simply charging when the incident occurred, it’s unclear what the company means by referring to external force as the cause of the incident. Here’s the full, amended statement Samsung shared with us:",

Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured. With this new workflow, if neither of those are an option, you can type out the name of the specific device you want to get online to initiate pairing.",

Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud.

The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button.

If you have no time to go through all your voicemails, Google’s “Take a Message” feature for Pixel devices can be really useful. If you miss or decline a call, Take a Message can automatically spin into action, informing the caller that you’re unavailable and asking them to record a message. While it sounds like voicemail, the feature uses AI to transcribe the message and automatically store it in your Pixel’s call history, where you can revisit it later. While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well. While very useful in theory, it has reportedly been malfunctioning, letting callers hear you instead of recording their message.

Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later.

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines The Galaxy S26 Ultra, along with the smaller S26 and the S26 Plus, is expected to arrive next month . And while it’s on track to launch as a new device, most people will agree it offers only minor improvements over the Galaxy S25 Ultra. That said, there are some new details rumored for the Galaxy S26 Ultra that could make it desirable to some users, whether they are using an older Samsung device or looking to switch from another phone brand. Irrespective of what we say, Samsung is already preparing to sell a boatload of Galaxy S26 Ultra units. It reportedly plans to produce roughly 3.6 million units for sale in the first wave after launch. Of course, not all upgrades will appeal equally to every buyer, and we want you to tell us which ones excite you.",

    "body": "The idea of the ultimate Google Pixel feature is difficult to envisage, because who knows what our smartphones will be capable of in five or ten years? However, when your flagship Pixel doesn’t have a feature that another brand already offers, it’s not unrealistic to hope that Google will introduce it to its own lineup sooner rather than later. With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game. Let’s take a look at the results.",
