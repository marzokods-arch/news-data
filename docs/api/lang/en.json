    "body": "Sabrina Carpenter hosted SNL for the first time and starred in eight sketches that made it to air Saturday night (Oct. 18) in an episode that seamlessly paired with the pop star&#8217;s brand of humor. With a background in comedy television &#8212; a decade ago, a then-teenaged Carpenter was the lead on the Boy Meets World spinoff Girl Meets World &#8212; and with some familiarity with the SNL stage (as a music performer twice, and with one &#8220;Domingo&#8221; sketch in her pocket), the singer/actress was poised for success pulling double duty as host and musical guest Saturday night. And she delivered, from the cold opening all the way through her final sketch of the night &#8212; with two playful performances sandwiched into the schedule (a youthfully staged &#8220;Manchild,&#8221; plus an uncensored &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s Son&#8221;).
