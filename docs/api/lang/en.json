(The distinction may be short lived; the former’s new album, Everybody Scream , was released Oct. 31 and will hit next week’s Billboard charts, dated Nov. 15.) Returning to Myself also starts at No. 1 on Top Rock Albums and Americana/Folk Albums . It&#8217;s Carlile&#8217;s sixth ruler on the latter list, second only to Bob Dylan ’s eight. Elsewhere, Re…",
