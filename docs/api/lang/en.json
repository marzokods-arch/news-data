Eventually, mass-deleting emails and photos to free up cloud storage space took its toll, and soon I found myself paying $2 a month for Google One Basic. That only solved my data cap problems for one Google account; not long after, I shelled out for Google One Premium to share 2TB of cloud storage across all my accounts. Subscriptions can get out of hand quickly, so Google One Premium at $10 per month was all I could muster. Despite owning multiple Nest displays and a Nest Video Doorbell, I stuck with only three hours of event recording to avoid paying another $10 for Nest Aware each month. Plus, my smart home is split between the Apple and Google ecosystems. Paying for Apple One gave me an unlimited number of HomeKit Secure Video (HSV) cameras with a 10-day recording history, making Nest Aware hard to justify.",

Apple TV, the rebranded streaming service formerly known as Apple TV+, seems to have another hit in the viral Pluribus series. However, it’s more expensive than ever to get started binging Apple TV titles. The streaming service hiked prices from $9.99 to $12.99 per month in August for new and existing subscribers. If you found those prices too expensive, Apple TV’s limited-time Black Friday promotion slashes the streaming service’s monthly price by more than half for six months.

Premium users will also soon see new features, including ‘SongDNA’ and ‘About the song’, offering deeper insights into track creators and musical connections. Thanks to the ever-increasing prices of music streaming services and the occasional introduction of new features, many people are interested in switching between services like Spotify , YouTube Music, and Apple Music. Users have had to resort to third-party tools to migrate between services, but lately, these platforms have made it easier for users to hop on and bring their playlists along. The latest addition to the pack is Spotify, which now allows users to transfer their playlists from other popular music apps easily. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Back in August, Google launched Nano Banana , its Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model that went viral for doing a great job with human subjects and making it easier to tweak generated images (mostly). People used it for all sorts of creations, such as making mini-figurines for themselves and restoring old photos. Today, Google is introducing Nano Banana Pro based on Gemini 3 Pro Image, making its image model better than ever before. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It’s now $699.99 , down from $999.99, and it’s also the model my colleague Jonathan keeps around specifically for deep-cleaning carpets. He’s plenty of Eufy’s lineup at home, and the E28 is the one he calls a “mopping and deep-clean champ.” Part of the appeal is that the E28 isn’t just another vacuum-and-mop combo. The dock hides a detachable FlexiOne deep cleaner, essentially a portable spot-cleaning unit you can grab for carpets, stairs, and fabric messes the robot can’t reach. It’s an unusual two-in-one setup — the robot handles the whole-home route, and the detachable cleaner takes care of the stubborn stuff.",

These cuts follow roughly 20,000 prior job losses over three years and represent one of the largest single reductions in Verizon’s history. Last week, we learned that both T-Mobile and Verizon were reportedly making some big changes in the near future. While T-Mobile has yet to unveil its news, Verizon has now officially announced its plans, as first noted by Bloomberg and confirmed by Verizon . As it turns out, Big Red is cutting more than 13,000 jobs, and it will also be converting 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchise locations.

A new string we discovered in the 2511 Android Canary build reveals a setting to link the mode across connected devices. When enabled, toggling Airplane Mode on your phone will automatically trigger it on your watch via Bluetooth. Most mobile devices feature a one-tap Airplane Mode that disables wireless radios. While designed to prevent interference with aircraft communications, many people also use the feature on the ground to preserve battery life. Although enabling Airplane Mode is simple, Android phones and Wear OS watches don’t currently sync this state. You must remember to toggle it on both devices individually. If you forget one, your device may needlessly drain its battery searching for a cellular signal at 30,000 feet. To solve this, Google is working on a new setting that syncs Airplane Mode between your devices.",
