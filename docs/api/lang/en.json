I test so many gaming headsets over the course of a year, it's easy to start blending them into one. After all, the basic archetype for a good one is pretty much sorted at this point—a comfy headband, two earcups, a microphone, and a great set of drivers. I thought I couldn't really be surprised by a new model, but the Fractal Design Scape changed all that for me in 2025. It's got the same recipe, sure. But in terms of the experience it delivers, it feels like Fractal Design has taken all the things I love about a really good set of gaming cans and elevated them to new heights. I'm convinced it's the way all wireless gaming headsets should be from this point onwards, and that makes it the best thing I've personally tested all year. The Scape is a lesson in refinement. For a start, it's got a grown-up chassis design. No garish colour schemes here, just a flat black, matte finish with some subtle, recessed RGB lighting. The controls feel reassuringly well designed, too. Each clunks and clicks with a positive action, with not a cheap material to be found. Spea…",

A massive, polished, smartly designed and pleasantly familiar game that saw little need to uproot the first game's well-tested formula. The now-ubiquitous portmanteau we use to describe the genre is, in itself, a reference to it being fertile ground for cross-pollinating ideas. Metroid's exploration dovetailed nicely with Castlevania's gothic stylings and Symphony Of The Night's surprisingly in-depth RPG elements, which Hollow Knight dials down the in favour of death mechanics and boss runbacks from Dark Souls. In recent years, we've seen plenty more experiments, with last year's Animal Well winning no shortage of praise by trading combat for ARG-adjacent layers of puzzling and cipher-cracking. And so here I am to present a handful of picks from 2025's bumper crop that bring distinct, fresh flavors to that familiar core of running, jumping and exploring.

We try pretty hard to avoid lazily dropping cliches into our writing here at PC Gamer, which puts me in an awkward position as I sit down to pitch to you why a remaster, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black , is one of the best games of 2025, despite mostly being a fresh Unreal Engine 5 skin for a game that came out in 2008. So if I must sin, I may as well see just how many forbidden phrases from the style guide I can use at once. 2025's brand new Ninja Gaiden 4, despite being a visceral action romp with more bloody decapitations than you can shake a stick at, is ultimately a bit of a mixed bag . At its core is a pulse-pounding combat system that echoes the greats of yesteryear, but it's rough around the edges. Fans of the genre will still find a lot to like, but at the end of the day it's not without flaws.

That glimpse, created over two weeks by an ILM artist, was Star Wars: Field Guide : a two-minute fizzle reel of AI-generated blue lions, tentacled walruses, turtles with alligator heads, and zebra-stripe chimpanzees, all lazily spliced together from the shuffled bits of normal-ass animals. These \"aliens\" were less Star Wars than they were Barnum & Bailey. It felt like a singular embarrassment: Instead of showing its potential, generative AI just demonstrated how out of touch a major media force had become. And then it kept happening. At the time, I wondered whether evoking the legacy of Lucasfilm just to declare creative bankruptcy had provoked enough disgusted responses to convince Disney to slow its roll on AI ventures…",

Want an ergonomic mouse? You have the Keychron M5 . Want something very cheap but high quality? No problem, you have the Glorious Model O Eternal . There's even been something for those of you looking for a nostalgia hit in the form of the 8BitDo Retro R8 . All those are genuinely fantastic mice, too.

That was nearly seven years ago at this point, but the game is turning even more heads today: it just hit an all-time concurrent player peak on Steam, according to SteamDB . Remarkably, it's not even close. Its previous peak is from when it released into early access in 2018, at just over 33,000 players, and this holiday season has brought it screaming past 57,000 a few hours before I wrote this article (it's settled down to about 35,000 now—still a notch above the old record). The game has been good the whole time, but there are a few probable causes for this sudden surge in spire slaying. As SteamDB notes , the 2025 winter sale brought Slay the Spire to a historic low of $2.49; while the site only records sale history two years back, I don't recall it ever being quite this cheap. As everyone rushes to burn their Steam wallets on the best deals, such an acclaimed game for the price of a pack of gum is a no-brainer.

And yet there are several unambiguous signs that the Arm revolution on the PC may well be imminent. Yes, for real this time. What's more, modern Arm CPUs look very compelling on paper. When it comes to single-core performance, all the indications are that they are actually superior to x86. And single-core performance is particularly important for gaming. Anyway, if the Snapdragon X has been a disappointment, that's perhaps as much down to unrealistic expectations as it is any failings of Snapdragon X or Arm CPUs more generally.

If you want to usher in the new year by dipping your toe into the scene, the latest Epic Games Store free game is Cassette Beasts—you can claim it here until tomorrow, December 28. PC Gamer's Lauren Morton wrote up impressions on the game back in 2023 and called it \"a pretty sick Pokémon remix,\" shouting out its nonstandard element types like plastic, glass, and glitter. Instead of taming wild animals, you transform into monsters you've \"recorded\" to cassette tapes. There's also the fusion system, where any two monster forms can be mixed and matched to get new ones complete with original pixel art and a mashed-up name. It's the sort of imagination kickstarter that should please fans of JRPG tactics and cozy gamers just here for the cool dudes alike. Even without all that, the addition of online co-op gives it a firm leg up over the genre's biggest entrants, and the musical aesthe…",

It's a change that's been percolating for a while, but 2025 was the year a number of developing trends in PC gaming's favorite genre finally boiled over. The time of extreme skill ceilings and the pursuit of metallic ranks defining every new multiplayer FPS is behind us. The escalation of gaudy, overpriced cosmetics created a distaste so palpable that Call of Duty had to desperately change its game plan. The two biggest shooters this year cost money, and there were no major free-to-play releases. The theme of this new era, as I see it developing so far, is remembering that shooters can be both casual and thrilling. High fun, low emotional investment. An old guard of life-consuming live-service games remains a vibrant and popular part of this genre, but they're once again sharing the space with—and even adopting the attributes of—a more casual breed. Games that don't mind if you only play them once in a while. Games that let you make your own fun, encourage cooperation, or earn our respect by not bombarding us with ads.

This year didn't leave me with a lack of things to talk about, either. If anything, it was almost too busy for even the most enthusiastic of survival crafting sickos. I spent months bouncing between my sandstorm-battered home in Dune: Awakening, then bug-infested dwellings in Grounded 2, and cobbled-together cubicles of Abiotic Factor. It's just, well, I really love the thrill of collecting giant piles of junk. Then there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of taking all that junk and turning it into things. And if you give me a monotonous little chore to do on the side? That's just icing on the cake.

Since launch, we've been pushing the game to its limits and have already discovered a number of odd quirks. While some make sense if you really think about it, most of them you'd never have guessed. Whether it's cheeky movement tech that'll give you a leg up Topside, skills not quite functioning how they should (or just being very weak), or the confusing way friendly fire works, it's all useful information to have stored in your brain. But not every tip you hear from other players is true. Below, I've picked a handful of Arc Raiders myths, and you'll have to figure out which ones are true and which are false. And if you guess wrong, you'll learn some surprisingly handy facts that'll keep you breathing next time you go to the surface, so it's a win-win.",

    "body": "Gear of the Year (Image credit: Future) Check out more of the year's best tech in our PC Gamer Hardware Awards 2025 coverage. It's been a relatively quiet year for new gaming CPUs, as AMD and Intel launched the bulk of their latest processors back in 2024. Ryzen 9000-series chips first appeared in the summer, with the Core Ultra 200S range making an appearance a few months later in October. Since then, retailers' listings have mostly been filled with non-overclockable or low-power versions, but AMD did drop a few niceties for us in 2025. Admittedly, most of them weren't much of a surprise, as the Ryzen 9 9950X3D was expected right from the launch of Zen 5. And the same is somewhat true of the Ryzen AI Max and Max+ processors, better known as Strix Halo. AMD announced them at CES , and we didn't have to wait too long before we saw mighty APUs in use in the Framework Desktop and even in some handhelds . The real surprise was the Ryzen 5 7500X3D . Basically just a cut-down Ryzen 7 7800X3D, it pretty much popped out of nowhere in November, and given that AMD had already launched the Ryzen 5 7600X3D in August, few folks expected another version of it (we're still waiting for a Zen 4 ve…",

Even though there has been a strong trend of co-op games in the past few years, Aggro Crab and Landfall weren't expecting Peak to explode in popularity. \"When we flew to Sweden to release the game with the Landfall team, we were ready to hit the launch button and go into vacation mode,\" Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman told GamesRadar . \"That quickly became a pipe dream.\" Everyone immediately fell in love with the game about elastic little guys waddling up mountains together and the developers quickly pivoted to supporting it with bug fixes, new items, and new maps. And now, six months later, the game is still thriving. Earlier this month, Peak had an in-game concert by rapper bbno$ like it was Fortnite. It's all mighty impressive for a game that has still maintained its charming game jam-like quality—something Kaman said was important to maintain as the studios updated it.

Outside of the casino, it’s word game developers who are the most frequent vultures hungrily circling poor little Balatro. Er, poor little obscenely-rich-and-successful Balatro. I can see the temptation as these games prove over and over that it doesn’t take much to turn Scrabble into a roguelike deckbuilder.

Thankfully decades-old Japanese computer games have a solution for this self-inflicted fugue: Compile's DiscStation series. DiscStation was a successful series of quarterly magazine/CD hybrids (or magazine/floppy hybrids in its earliest form) created by the Puyo Puyo developer, focussed entirely on its own impressive and ever-expanding body of work. Much more than a typical combination of written features with a demo disc slapped on the cover, the paper portions burst with exclusive comics, lavish multi-page instructions, masses of world building material, reader-submitted fan art in all shapes and sizes, and the occasional poster. Even the adverts are delightful, pitching all sorts of rarely-seen Compile merchandise—edible snacks, pocket mirrors,…",

When I asked whether the team thought it was down to cultural differences, he agreed. \"There may be some nuances that were lost in translation when we did that,\" he said. \"So it was definitely interesting, or rather surprising, when we went to Anime Expo [in Los Angeles], and when Subway Slammer appeared on the screen, a lot of people were cheering for him.\" (Image credit: SEGA) I do have to wonder whether or not that was the team's first exposure to how heavily clowned upon the Subway Slammer was—I would sure as hell be confused if I were in their shoes.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Nothing says \"dollhouse simulation game that doubles as a satire on capitalism\" quite like 97 paid expansion, game, and stuff packs. The Sims has been churning out DLC before people even knew what to call it, and 25 years later we're practically drowning in all of the extra add-ons and doodads you can hand over your precious money for. But just how many of them can you actually name? Can you still recall all seven original Sims expansion packs from memory, or have you somehow catalogued all 52 of the expansion, game, and stuff packs that are in The Sims 4 as of this quiz going live? Yep, you read that right—The Sims 4 alone accounts for over half of the paid DLC available across the entire series. That's even excluding the fact that I've deigned not to include kits in this list—there are simply too damn many of them (48 at the time of writing, almost all of the rest of The Sims 4's DLC combined) and are churned out at such a rate that I imagine there'll be anothe…",

    "body": "2025 was a year of highs and lows for me. Not for personal or professional reasons, but rather because I got weirdly obsessed with the height of videogame characters. It started with the surprising revelation that every FromSoftware protagonist outside of Elden Ring Nightreign is exactly 5'7\", a fact I learned from a YouTube investigation by FromSoft savant Zullie the Witch. I'd always assumed FromSoftware protagonists were taller than this. I'm not sure why, but it's probably due to how Anglo-American entertainment media has programmed my brain to perceive heroic archetypes as tall, dark and handsome. So finding out that all FromSoft's dodge-rolling warriors are the same height as me was surprising, leading me to think more deeply about how we represent height in games. Some of this manifested in bizarre tangents, like when I bugged Arkane Studios level designer and The Black Parade director Romain Barrilliot to help me figure out the height of Garrett from Thief. Interestingly, it turns out that Garrett's height varies across the games. He's exactly six feet tall in Thief: The Dark Project , slightly taller in Thief 2: The Metal Age (though this extra couple of inches may be pur…",

AMD's Z Extreme range is still going strong, though, with the Z1 Extreme making for a good mid-range handheld, and the new Z2 Extreme powering the surprisingly capable Asus ROG Xbox Ally X . The Xbox Ally X had to do an awful lot to justify the very premium price point, but smart software, a comfortable fit, and excellent performance make it a standout choice for the 1% of the gaming world. Despite its latest range of desktop chips being a bit of a letdown, Intel managed to put out some fierce mobile chips, too. The Core Ultra 7 258V powering the MSI Claw 8 AI+ seems to be one of the standouts, giving excellent performance.

SteamOS has shown what Linux can be capable of for gaming in large part because of Proton , the compatibility layer Valve employs to translate Windows commands into ones that Linux can understand. It's a fork of WINE tailored towards gaming, created and maintained by Valve specifically for that purpose. Over the years, Proton has gotten so good that compatible games tend to run flawlessly.

Until Larian unveiled Divinity, we didn't know what it was doing next—only that it wouldn't be Baldur's Gate 4. At GDC 2024, about nine months after BG3's release, Larian boss Swen Vincke dropped a bombshell: The studio would not make an expansion pack or sequel to its most successful game to date, and was parting ways with Wizards of the Coast and D&D entirely.

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . Nothing I have ever done has filled me with as much pride as The Half Pint, my hobbity pub serving patrons all across the idyllic Shire, which I built and manage from within early access sim Tavern Keeper. We serve a wide range of drinks and snacks, from reasonably priced wine and ale to skewers of ethically sourced meats (the source is an ogre and he seems very above board), host live music and any comedians who haven't been cancelled yet, and thanks to my business acumen we are absolutely rolling in it. But this isn't why I'm so proud of my little business. Tavern Keeper is a fantastic management sim, undoubtedly, boasting a great deal of flexibility and ways to keep the lights on while still providing plenty of wrinkles that keep you on your toes, from magical pyromaniacs to grumpy staff to huge parties demanding all of your attention. It's the interior decorating that's left me obsessed, though. (Ima…",

In 2025, as graphics cards, memory, and storage have become harder to find at reasonable prices, monitors have only become better value. So, should you have the rig to run it, there has never been a better time to upgrade to a 4K screen. Philips remains in good form, with its Evnia 27M2N3800A being arguably the best-priced 4K panel we've seen (and with a neat dual resolution mode). MSI just barely missed out on a nomination for its 271QR OLED monitor , which is a bright and super snappy panel. Acer, Asus, LG, and AOC all had strong showings this year, too, but in such a packed year, you need to pick just a handful and the Alienware and KTC below just managed to beat them out. Our Alienware pick is super quick, with a gorgeous HDR QD-OLED panel. The KTC monitor is a bit of an underdog without the recognisable name of Philips or Alienware, yet it's still a punchy, quick and affordable 1440p panel. If you're in the market for a new monitor, we have picked out three that deserve a nomination for the best monitor of the year. Come back on New Year's Eve to disco…",

Once you're done singing carols, roasting chestnuts, kissing under the mistletoe, or recovering from a trio of ghostly visitations by instructing a street urchin to buy an enormous dead bird, I'd like to introduce you to the weird world of Santa games on Steam. The vessel I have chosen to deliver this information to you may sound strange: a quiz is how you test someone's knowledge, not how you teach them about how many sex games on Steam feature Santa Claus. But it's a holiday miracle! I promise you don't need to know a single goddamn thing about Steam's bizarre collection of Santa games to do well on this quiz. One warning : There are images in this quiz, and while there's nothing X or even R-rated, a couple images are a mildly saucy, so don't start the quiz if Mom is looking over your shoulder, unless Mom is a modern woman who doesn't blanch at seeing a cartoon elf with a little cleavage.

With Nvidia releasing a whole new generation of graphics chips (and you can bet I've been testing a ton of those as well...), the best gaming laptop manufacturers have been hard at work either respinning their old machines to make way for the new GPU silicon, or completely redesigning their laptop chassis for a new year. And the very first one to land in my lap this year was definitely the latter, with the Razer Blade 16 popping up with a new design intent on taking the crown back from Asus. The ROG Zephyrus G16 was the hands-down winner last year, with a mix of stylish, slimline chassis and impressive gaming performance, while Razer's finest of 2024 looked bloated by comparison. Not so this year, as the Blade 16 is our first nomination for the best notebook of 2025.

I don't just mean outright frame rates, though that's no small matter.

Over the past 12 months, we've dug deep into the performance, graphics, and development quality of 13 games released this year. The majority of these, plus many others that we've played and tested (but not done a full analysis of), were basically fine: not great, not bad, merely okay.
