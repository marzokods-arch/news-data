As per a recent leak, One UI 8.5 may put apps with “excessive ad” spam into a state of “deep sleep.” It may also begin analyzing notifications on device to ensure they’re only blocked if they’re spam. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 interface brings heaps of changes to Galaxy phones and tablets. The aesthetic upgrades expected of this update chiefly focus on a new glass-inspired interface , more customizable quick settings, visually demarcated menus, and a 3D effect for icons . Meanwhile, the UI is also expected to bring iOS-like notification summaries and improvements to Now Bar . In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could bring additional settings to prevent apps with excessive notifications from badgering you. Tipster Tarun Vats shared on X a couple of screenshots of an upcoming One UI 8.5 feature that would block apps that continuously display “excessive ads.”",

Speaking to The Sun , Minogue explained that the idea first came to her while she was in Berlin shortly after releasing her first holiday album, Kylie Christmas , that same year. “The song comes from 2015. I was at Soho House in Berlin, it was summer on the terrace and we’d just done the first Christmas album,” she said. “We’d had a couple of glasses of wine &#8230; and it came to us like ‘YMCA’ but ‘XMAS.’ I’ve been sitting on the chorus for 10 years.” The single arrives with a video that sees Minogue recreating the iconic flying lift from Dirty Dancing .

Finding a good, free wallpaper for your Android phone is now very easy. Part of the reason for this is the prevalence of great resources in the form of apps and websites (like ours, which brings you fresh wallpapers every Wednesday ).

The rising British singer-songwriter called out the platforms last week after fans discovered third-party listings priced at more than 14 times the original cost — in some cases surpassing $1,000. In an open letter, Dean described the unchecked resale market as “disgusting,” “vile” and fundamentally “exploitative,” urging companies to “do better” to protect fans. On Wednesday, Ticketmaster responded with a rare concession: a commitment to cap future resale rates for Dean’s tour and to begin refunding fans who paid above face value on its platform. “We support artists’ ability to set the terms of how their tickets are sold and resold. @OliviaDeano, we will cap resale prices on our site at face value and hope other resale sites will follow,&#8221; Ticketmaster initially replied.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Messages is testing a new long-press shortcut to quickly switch SIMs while composing messages. The feature reduces the steps required to swap SIMs after Google previously removed the SIM selector from the compose bar and buried it inside the profile page. The new method for switching SIMs is a helpful improvement, but still redirects to the profile section instead of switching SIMs instantly. Being able to quickly and easily switch SIMs while texting is an important feature for Google Messages users who use two different lines on the same phone. However, earlier this year, Google made that simple action more frustrating by burying the SIM switcher deeper in the UI and adding unnecessary extra steps to the process. Now, it appears that Google Messages is taking steps to rectify that change.",

In the post, Siwa explained that she had been dealing with persistent discomfort for several days, which intensified any time she danced, walked or moved. “Every time that I’ve been dancing for the last couple of days or even just walking, my stomach would just really, really hurt,” she said. At first, she assumed the pain was related to menstrual cramps, adding that she tried to ease it with a warm bath. “That set it off 100 times worse,” she said. After calling her mother for advice, Siwa said she was urged to phone an ambulance. At the hospital, doctors told her the cause: “One of my ovaries had a cyst on it that burst and was bleeding into my stomach,” she explained. She added that the blood in her abdomen triggered the intense pain. “Anytime that the blood in your stomach moves, that’s the bleeding in the stomach. It’s like brutal pain.” Despite the medical emergency, Siwa still performed her …",

That’s why we have gadgets like massage guns, foam rollers, and specialized shoes with plates and innovative midsole foams. Sometimes, though, that’s still not enough. When that happens, runners turn to even more extreme measures to get their miles in. We buy shoes with illegal stack heights, pick up fancy compression boots to squeeze the pain out of our legs, and step into exoskeletons to make each step easier.

While most Android purists might disagree, I’m glad that one of my favorite Android brands , OnePlus, is implementing some iOS-inspired features. One of my favorites lets you control accessories, especially wireless earbuds, much more easily. The addition comes with OnePlus’ new OxygenOS 16 interface, introduced to the OnePlus 13 late last month and now rapidly spreading to several older or less premium devices (while the OnePlus 15 arrived with it out of the box).",

YouTube’s Twitter account is one of the more innocuous things you’ll find on that increasingly distasteful platform, and beyond occasionally sharing news of feature additions or the latest content to arrive, it tweets some pretty harmless messages : “it’s a stay-in-and-watch-videos-with-friends kind of night,” “ when your watch history is more accurate than your horoscope ,” or “thankful for creators who inspire us every day .” But earlier this week, the account really stepped in it — in a way that the people running it probably never anticipated.

By implementing this API to transfer login tokens silently, Uber estimates it will eliminate 4 million manual logins annually for its users. While Uber is a prime example, more developers need to adopt this API for Android to fully rival the seamless restore experience of iPhones. Last year, Google introduced the Restore Credentials API within Android’s Credential Manager, aiming to solve one of the most significant friction points of switching phones: Getting logged out of all your apps. A year later, Google has shared an update on how this has progressed, and this small change has helped Uber reduce manual logins by an estimated 4 million logins per year!

Google’s Nano Banana Pro model , based on the Gemini 3 Pro Image, is one of the best tools available today for generating images. My colleague Mishaal Rahman tried out Nano Banana Pro and walked away impressed .

    "body": "ESA/Webb, NASA &amp; CSA, J. H. Kastner (Rochester Institute of Technology) Using its Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam), NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope captured never-before-seen details of the Red Spider Nebula, a planetary nebula, in this image released on Oct. 26, 2025 . NIRCam is Webb&#8217;s primary near-infrared imager, providing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for a wide variety of investigations. Webb’s new view of the Red Spider Nebula reveals for the first time the full extent of the nebula’s outstretched lobes, which form the ‘legs’ of the spider. These lobes, shown in blue, are traced by light emitted from H2 molecules, which contain two hydrogen atoms bonded together. Stretching over the entirety of NIRCam’s field of view, these lobes are shown to be closed, bubble-like structures that each extend about 3 light-years. Outflowing gas from the center of the nebula has inflated these massive bubbles over thousands of years. Image credit: ESA/Webb, NASA &amp; CSA, J. H. Kastner (Rochester Institute of Technology)",

    "body": "NASA’s Lucy spacecraft captured images of the Moon’s surface on Oct 16, 2022, after flying by the Earth for its first of three gravity assists. Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images. Award: $55,000 in total prizes Open Date: November 25, 2025 Close Date: January 19, 2026 For more information, visit: https://www.topcoder.com/nasa-crater-detection",
