(Bezos is now worth more than $200 billion). It's a great example of the sort of clever data-based trinket that grabs the internet's attention every so often, like Asteroid Launcher , Subway Builder , or today's Jmail , which lets you browse more than 2,000 of Jeffrey Epstein's emails in a fake Gmail inbox. Fun , right? Okay, maybe not as fun as pretending to spend Jeff Bezos' money, or idly messing around with what kind of crater an asteroid would leave if it landed directly on your house and offered you the sweet release of obliteration. But Jmail does allow you to type \"Bezos\" into the familiar Gmail search bar and discover an email exchange listing his name alongside Marc Andreesen, Sergey Brin, Bill Gates and Peter Thiel for a potential seminar about \"MONEY\" circa 2012.

The International Defense Esports Games , announced today by the UK Ministry of Defense, is an esports tournament that \"builds a bridge between defense readiness and the fast-paced world of competitive gaming,\" the IDEG website says. Not too far removed from, say, putting up recruitment booths at esports majors, except that the goal here, stated far more explicitly than I've seen in the past, is to leverage the games to sign up the kids.

The technique was shockingly effective. In the paper outlining their findings , titled \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models,\" the researchers explained that formulating hostile prompts as poetry \"achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches.\" (Image credit: Wikimedia Commons) The researchers were emphatic in noting that—unlike many other methods for attempting to circumvent LLM safety heuristics—all of the poetry prompts submitted during the exper…",

It's just the base game and not the monolith of DLC that followed its release, but that DLC is at a steep discount to complement the free weekend. You might think that everyone's moved on to the game's Warhammer 40,000 flavored successor, Darktide, but Vermintide 2 remains alive and well. It got a new free level as recently as last week and, as SteamDB shows, it still accrues a peak of several thousand concurrent players each day. If you're not familiar with the game, we called it the best co-op game of 2018 . In his review , PC Gamer writer Steven Messner called it \"gleefully gory\" and said it \"succeeds on the merits of its stellar combat and level design.\" Modeled after Left 4 Dead, the game sees you and a few mates trawl around the ruins of Warhammer Fantasy's apocalypse, cleaving rats into chunks in first-person.

(Image credit: Ludogram) Ok, now that's out of the way, we can break down what that actually means. Basically, in each run you are the custodian of a city on wheels, as it rolls along pursued by ever-escalating hordes of monsters. Your character has auto-firing weapons, like in Vampire Survivors, but so does the city. Instead of adding to your arsenal, level ups allow you to add more buildings, from towers to farmland to factories, all feeding into your defence. If your hero dies, you simply place a grave in your city and spawn a new one—but if your city takes too many hits, it crumbles, and the run is over. So guarding your home as it trundles along is vital… but you're also encouraged to risk breaking away to explore. Out at the edges of the 'road' can be found trees, rocks, and gold ore, all useful in your quest.

Developed by PUBG Studios, Black Budget is a PvPvE shooter set on a remote island that's trapped in a time loop and also being consumed by a supernatural phenomenon called—wait for it—the Anomaly. Okay, no points for originality there, but the game also promises \"a focus on exploration and discovery rather than pure survival and combat,\" which I do find interesting.

The benefit has been a more consistent release schedule. But there are downsides too. The first of these expansions, Secrets of the Obscure, felt like it was trying to pack too much into its limited development schedule—its ambition in terms of story far outstripping what ArenaNet had the time to make. Despite plenty of positives, it ultimately felt rushed and underdeveloped. Last year's Janthir Wilds was more assured, taking valuable lessons from SotO in terms of its scope. It launched with one of the best maps in recent memory (alongside a second that was simply OK), and brought a handful of features that made for a promising first impression. It put its best foot forward, but then ran out of steam. What followed in the subsequent updates was… fine, mostly, but paled in comparison to the expansion's opening salvo, and didn't make the most of the concepts the story was teasing. (Image credit: ArenaNet) Visions of Eternity, then, is another shot at proving this annual expansion plan has the juice. It's the best opening act o…",

Nevertheless, I'd rather not get jumped like that again, and there's actually a rather simple solution I've found for it. Head into the audio settings and enable Night Mode , found just under the audio output option at the top of the list What this does is basically compresses the dynamic range of audio, so loud sounds like gunshots and explosions are quieter and soft sounds like footsteps are louder.

All you really have to do is find a footlocker in an apartment building for Tian Wen. The only problem? There are multiple apartment areas on Dam Battlegrounds, each with their own separate buildings. Sure, you'll find it if you methodically search, but if you want to know its exact location and speed things up a bit, I'll explain exactly where to find Major Aiva's footlocker below. You'll also have to extract an item to complete the quest. While there are plenty of extract points nearby, and Dam Battlegrounds is one of the safest maps, you might want to use a safe pocket instead of a free loadout . Search for Major Aiva's mementos in the apartments northwest of The Dam The footlocker is in the 2nd floor apartment of the southwest building at Ruby Residence (Image credit: Embark Studios) First, you'll need to head to the Ruby Residence area in the north of Dam Battlegrounds, to the northwest of the Hydroponic Dome Complex, and to the west of the Generator Halls and Power Generation Complex.

Turns out that, rather than falling victim to an enormous monetary calamity or getting snapped up by Tencent, Ubi's finances were delayed because the company appointed new auditors in July. So that was a bit of a damp squib, but it doesn't mean nothing of note came from the report itself. For instance, are you excited to hear that, per CEO Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft is \"making great strides in applying gen-AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams\"? No? How odd. After all, Guillemot points out that AI is \"as big a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D, and we have everything to lead on the front\" which certainly has the tenor of something that should get us all very excited. Guillemot and Ubisoft have been banging the AI drum for a while now. Last year, it unveiled its AI-powered \" neo-NPCs ,\" promising that \"each conversation between the player and an NPC\" would be \"unique and responsive to the players and their actions, leading to fully personalized and immersive experiences.\" So, …",

It's not quite Snezhnaya, the realm of the Cryo Archon that we can expect to arrive in future, but Nod-Krai is an autonomous area that's technically part of the same region. For those who are new to Genshin livestream codes, miHoYo puts on a live programme every six weeks, and as an incentive to tune in, it drops three codes you can redeem for Primogems with which to wish on new characters. In version 6.2, we have pyro and anemo characters coming in the form of Durin and Jahoda. We're also apparently getting reruns for Venti and Varesa, but this isn't 100% until the livestream airs. As always, I'll put the codes down below as they go live during the stream. Since livestream codes usually expire within a day , you'll want to grab these as soon as possible if you want the Primogems.

Small issues and bugs have been piling up, the Halloween event was a flop, and we've all been frustrated with the lack of an endgame. All of this stacking up before the launch of the first paid DLC, a holiday-themed pack, certainly put a damper on the celebrations. I'm glad to report that the latest Borderlands 4 weekly update has solved a number of these hot-button issues, and Gearbox has even left us a present under the tree. Let's get the biggest news out of the way first—Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is now free for all players and available right now. This holiday DLC was previously announced as a premium, paid pack, but Gearbox explains that it couldn't quite do everything it planned to before it had to release it, so it opted to make it free instead. To ensure those who own the Deluxe and above versions of the game still get the content they paid upfront for, there will be another DLC in the future, Bounty Pack 5. \"This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year.

The sadly now mortal Task Manager has also suffering from an indignity for months that I have only just noticed: a crappy, Windows 11-ified icon. I am generally ambivalent about Windows 11's aesthetic. The icons and menus are mostly uninspired but serviceable, blending in with 2020s corporate visual design in a manner befitting an operating system that's iterated itself into a state of near non-identity ( AI will solve that problem, of course !). The desire for, I guess, cohesive branding has hit some Windows icons harder than others. Every Microsoft Office application is now represented by an amorphous blob of color that suggests the vague idea of a thing. It's funny that a decade or so ago we were remarking upon the fact that the go-to save icon, a floppy disk, is a meaningless reference for young people. Now Microsoft has deliberately chosen to turn Outlook's icon into MC Escher's interpretation of an envelope. Take that art history elective if you want to use Office, I guess! (Image …",

But where the previous Spider-Man crossover set was content to wrap deep cuts from the Spider-Verse in existing mechanics, Avatar is more systemically ambitious, giving each flavor of elemental bending its own mechanic. Which is an interesting choice for a set you would expect to be aimed at younger players, but I guess they figured if a 12-year-old can play Magic and make it through the filler episodes where Aang and the gang trudge through a swamp or a town where things are a bit weird then they can sure as hell learn some new rules.

And developer Chief Rebel has the numbers to show it. In a new developer update video , community director Hamish Bode laid out some fun numbers from the game's first month in early access. Even though Fellowship has a long road ahead of it, players have already sunk in a combined 7.2 million hours played. In that time, over 9 million dungeons have been cleared. Bode didn't share the number of dungeons players failed to clear, but he did say that they've died over 49 million times. Ouch. All of that is really just proof that a game where you can run MMO-style dungeons over and over is exactly the kind of thing people have been hoping someone would make.

They didn't make it into the game for its early access debut and narrowly missed the last update. And now, it looks like GGG is ready to release them out into the world. In that preview video, you can see the pretty classic druid fantasy on display: In their human form they can call down lightning strikes and pull lava out of the ground, and then they can transform into a bear to pulverize packs of monsters. Druids were still in an early state back when GGG dropped that footage, so I can only assume there wil…",

They openly cheat, regularly bending or breaking rules to give computer-controlled characters an unfair advantage, so much so that even the shortest session can rapidly erode any sense of goodwill anyone ever had for blood-splattered fighting games. Learning how to consistently beat these frauds using some repetitive cheese only encourages bad habits that are neither useful against another player or in fighting games in general.

I wouldn't put much stock in that last one though. Rumors about a possible Sims 4 remaster came to a boil earlier this week thanks to a post by The Sims Community collecting a small handful of vague \"I know something you don't\" style posts on X by those claiming to have some inside info. It's either a \"rewrite\" of The Sims 4 or a \"remaster\" or \"Sims 4 HD,\" according to a variety of unconfirmed sources. There were also images leaked from a playtest—of what appears to be the same mobile Sims game playtests that have been leaking on the regular for around a year—along with mention of a \"platform for the future\" likely referring to the same The Sims Hub that EA vaguely announced last year and has yet to officially mention again.

But it's still making corrections before that, too, and interested run-and-gunners will have a chance to check out the latest updates in another round of playtesting set for December. Unlike the recently concluded October playtest, which was open to players in North America and Europe, this one in December will be accessible only to those in North America. Otherwise, it looks to be pretty much the same deal, including that it's invite-only, invitations cannot be shared, and the whole thing is \"strictly under an NDA,\" meaning you can't stream it or \"share your playtest experience publicly.\" That strikes me as not great. PC Gamer's senior video producer Scott Tanner just broke it to me that March 2026 isn't much more than three months away, and maybe I'm being a little alarmist but Bungie maintaining such a tight lid on Marathon at this late stage seems discomfitingly cautious for a game that was meant to be Bungie's next big thing.
