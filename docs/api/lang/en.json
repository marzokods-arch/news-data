In our recent poll, nearly 72% of readers said they liked the feature , which is a comfortable win for something brand new in a season already packed with roundups. Recap pulls together your year on YouTube across 12 cards, including the summarizing Personality Card. Now, YouTube has shared how common each personality actually is. According to the company’s blog , these personalities are meant to be a simple way of grouping different viewing patterns. They’re not meant to be deep insights into who you are, just a light shorthand for the sort of content you spend most of your time with.

KPop Demon Hunters, the Labubu craze, Luka trade rumors, Alcaraz vs. Sinner, Charlie Kirk, and scenes of communities rebuilding all feature. The film also pulls in global moments like major cricket matches and a reference to the first American pope. Google already shared the top trending searches of 2025 last week , but now it has released the video version. The fast and chaotic montage pulls together many of the moments people kept asking about this year to summarize the last 12 months and add a touch of nostalgia. You can watch it above. The film has its own angle, built around a “reimagining” concept that pops up a few times, mixed with some big soundtrack choices. It starts with Ozzy Osbourne’s Crazy Train, swings into Lady Gaga’s Abracadabra, and eventually settles into Golden, performed by various artists. It ends up feeling a bit like Spotify Wrapped or YouTube Recap , just with more real-world news footage and less personalization.",

A more advanced follow-up to the surprisingly popular Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses (), the new glasses have a monocular display (meaning there’s one screen in one of the lenses), a Neural Band wrist strap that lets you control what you see by performing air gestures, and, most importantly, a price: $799. While expensive, this kept Meta at the forefront of the burgeoning XR revolution by making it the first major tech player to have a retail-ready set of smart glasses that seem to bring us the future Google Glass promised us over 10 years ago. Unfortunately for Meta, there are three major problems with the new Ray-Bans.

Between all its strengths like the unmatched e-ink screen, battery life measured in weeks, and the sheer portability, the Kindle is fundamentally a device built for content consumption. As a tool for reading with limited annotation capabilities, the Kindle lies squarely in Amazon’s walled garden. Over the years, Amazon has given it a limited additions like the ability to look up definitions using a dictionary that is useful but painfully isolated. Sure, there are features like X-Ray for deeper story insights, but those only work if you have bought a book from Amazon’s storefront. For the dedicated reader or an enthusiast like me, if you want to deeply engage with the source material, that consumption-only focus has always been the system’s biggest flaw. You essentially needed a smartphone alongside if you wanted to look up additional context. Adding Gemini to the Kindle is the single biggest upgrade any reader can make to their reading experience.

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR New strings in Google Play Services indicate that enabling Android Advanced Protection Mode will automatically disable the Watch Unlock feature on Pixel Watch. This potential change prioritizes maximum security over convenience, preventing accidental unlocks if your watch is merely nearby. Users will likely need to toggle off Advanced Protection Mode to regain the ability to unlock their Pixel phone via their Pixel Watch. The Google Pixel Watch features a Watch Unlock function that allows you to use the smartwatch as a key to unlock your Pixel phone. This is very convenient, as it replaces the need for a traditional passcode or biometric identification as long as you’re wearing the watch (and it’s connected to your phone). Although the feature is great, there are instances when you don’t want your watch to unlock your phone. Google could soon update the Watch Unlock functionality to prevent your phone from unlocking with the Pixel Watch when security features like Android Advanced Protection Mode are enabled.

That balance is slowly changing in the US as prepaid adoption is rising while postpaid growth has stalled or even slipped in some cases. The main driver is customer frustration with steady price escalations, including fee hikes, smaller autopay discounts, and direct plan increases. For example, Verizon recently cut its myPlan autopay discount from ten dollars to five dollars, and all three major carriers have raised their infrastructure fees. T-Mobile also stopped including taxes and fees in its advertised pricing. I have argued before that prepaid is now the better choice for many consumers. The real questions are what caused this shift, whether it could have been avoided, and how worried the big three should be about prepaid competitors.",

When Google is putting in so much effort to make Android apps interoperable — from letting you play Android games on Windows to making Pixel 10s work with Apple AirDrop (you know, the existing desktop ecosystem) — isn’t this the better direction to put your energy into instead of creating a new OS from scratch?",

The Reader C keeps the same compact build, data-only SIM card support, and dedicated AI button. Priced at $349, it is available now through ViWoods and third-party retailers like Amazon. Just weeks after we covered ViWoods’ unexpectedly ambitious AiPaper Reader, the world’s first reader running Android 16 , the company is already expanding the lineup. This time, it’s adding a splash of color with the AiPaper Reader C, a variant that trades the crisp monochrome Carta panel for a color E Ink display. It’s a trendy pivot, as more and more e-readers get colorful makeovers throughout the market. The move to color should make the Reader C more appealing to anyone who regularly handles comics, illustrated books, children’s titles, or PDFs with charts and diagrams. Color E Ink still isn’t vibrant in the LCD sense, but it does add context that grayscale can’t always capture. As always, a color E Ink panel also reduces sharpness, meaning text and fine lines won’t look as crisp as they do on the monochrome AiPaper Reader.",

Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well.

The narrow waterway separating Peninsular Malaysia from the Indonesian island of Sumatra sits so close to the equator that the Coriolis effect is usually too weak to allow storms to rotate enough to organize into cyclones. But on November 25, 2025, meteorologists watched as a tropical depression intensified into Cyclone Senyar—just the second documented case of a tropical cyclone forming in the strait. Hemmed in by land on both sides, Senyar made landfall in Sumatra later that day as it made a U-turn and headed east toward Malaysia. As the slow-moving storm passed over Sumatra’s mountainous terrain, it dropped nearly 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain in many areas, according to satellite-based estimates from NASA’s Global Precipitation Me…",

The instruments will improve our knowledge of the lunar environment to support NASA’s further exploration of the Moon and beyond to Mars. A visualization of the Moon’s South Pole region created with data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been surveying the Moon with seven instruments since 2009. NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio/Ernie Wright “The Apollo Era taught us that the further humanity is from Earth, the more dependent we are on science to protect and sustain human life on other planets,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “By deploying these two science instruments on the lunar surface, our proving ground, NASA is leading the world in the creation of humanity’s interplanetary survival guide to ensure the health and safety of our spacecraft and human explorers as we begin our epic journey back to the Moon and onward to Mars.” After his voyage to …",
