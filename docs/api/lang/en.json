Pricing on products like a 15 pan eyeshadow palette, lipstick and lip liner duos and more ranges from $95 for the full collection to $10 for a single jelly shadow. The product color scheme is grungy and gothic with vampy red hues thrown in here and there to mimic the look of blood, obviously. Product formulas are inventive with jelly-like textures and new finishes from the sole palette, namely the metallic chrome finish that packs a punch. ColourPop has also bundled a bunch of the products, giving prospective buyers the option to buy multiple products for one neat little price.

ExoMiner++, a recently updated open-source software package developed by NASA, uses artificial intelligence to help find new transiting exoplanets in data collected by NASA’s missions. NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI) Scientists have discovered over 6,000 planets that orbit stars other than our Sun, known as exoplanets. More than half of these planets were discovered thanks to data from NASA’s retired Kepler mission and NASA’s current TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission. However, the enormous treasure trove of data from these missions still contains many yet-to-be-discovered planets. All of the data from both missions is publicly available in NASA archives, and many teams around the world have used that data to find new planets using a number of techniques. In 2021, a team from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley created ExoMiner, a piece of open-source software that used artificial intelligence (AI) to validate 370 new exoplanets from Kepler data. Now, the team has created a new …",
