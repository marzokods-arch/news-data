In a brief fan Q&amp;A posted on the official Kelly Clarkson Show YouTube channel , the 43-year-old pop star and talk show host was asked about one thing she does every day that brings her joy. Her answer centered on her two children with Blackstock, daughter River and son Remington. &#8220;Snuggle,&#8221; Clarkson said. &#8220;My kids, they&#8217;re 9 and 11. They&#8217;re at that special little fun stage where they can wipe their own behinds, but they&#8217;re still small enough to love cuddling and love snuggles.&#8221; She continued, &#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot for our family recently, and so I have allowed my kids to sleep with me quite a bit. It&#8217;s my two dogs, my two kids and me. It&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s been really special, though, because the conversations you have during that time are pretty cute. So that&#8217;s probably my favorite time of day.&#8221; The Q&amp;A, shared Saturday (Jan. 10), comes five months after Blackstock’s passin g at 48 in August 2025 from cancer. He had been diagnosed with melanoma three years earlier. Clarkson was marr…",

On Saturday, the Carolina Panthers almost pulled off a major upset against the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears put on a show against their heated rivals, the Green Bay Packers. Next up, the Buffalo Bills head to Jacksonville to take on a young and motived Jaguars squad let by Trevor Lawrence. This matchup isn&rsquo;t a long-standing rivalry game, but it does have major career stakes for both quarterbacks: Lawrence and Josh Allen. Josh, who&rsquo;s undoubtedly a top QB in the league has continued to fall short in the playoffs against his AFC counterpart Patrick Mahomes. With the Chiefs, alongside the Lamar Jackson and the Ravens and Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals all out of the postseason, there isn&rsquo;t an easier path for Allen to finally make it to the Super Bowl.

On Saturday (Jan. 10), the model and fashion icon shared a sentimental Instagram post revealing the fresh ink, which she described as a lasting tribute to the musician, who died in 2016 at age 69. Posting a video of the tattoo process on her arm, Iman wrote in the caption, “Jan 10th. The pain didn’t vanish .. it left in its place a loving permanent mark,” adding the hashtag #BowieForever. The post was set to Bowie’s song “Subterraneans,” a track from his 1977 album Low .

At the time, a statement shared on his official Facebook page confirmed that he had “died peacefully today surrounded by his family after a courageous 18-month battle with cancer,” and asked fans to respect the family’s privacy during their grief.

The small satellite is now awaiting instrument calibration following a successful integration in Canada and rigorous testing by engineers at the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. StarBurst is designed to detect the initial emission of short gamma-ray bursts, some of the most powerful explosions in the universe and a key indicator of neutron star mergers. This would provide valuable insight into such events, which are also detected through gravitational waves by observatories on Earth. These events are where most of the heavy metals in the universe, such as gold and platinum, are formed. To date, only one such event has been observed simultaneously in gravitational waves and gamma-rays; StarBurst is expected to find up to 10 per year. StarBurst arrived at NASA Marshall in March 2025.

This image shows low-lying clouds over the delta on the morning of January 6, captured by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on NASA’s Terra satellite. Dense fog, particularly radiation fog , is common this time of year, forming when ground temperatures are cool, winds are light, and moisture is abundant near the surface. The meteorological departments of both Bangladesh and India called for moderate to very dense fog over the region that day amid an…",

Lanteris Space Systems Development continues on NASA’s Power and Propulsion Element, a solar electric propulsion spacecraft designed to provide power for Gateway in lunar orbit. Able to generate 60 kilowatts of power, the element was successfully powered on earlier last year. The milestone demonstrates the element can provide the spacecraft with power, high-rate communications, attitude control, as well as the ability to maintain and maneuver between orbits. The Power and Propulsion Element is managed by NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and built by industry partner Lanteris Space Systems in Palo Alto, California, where teams have secured the element’s main electrical system inside protective exterior panels. On deck for installation at Lanteris Space Systems are three 12-kilowatt advanced electric propulsion system thrusters, manufactured by L3Harris, and four 6-kilowatt Busek-built BHT-6000 thrusters.
