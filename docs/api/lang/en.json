Initially, it was mostly curiosity and tinkering. That changed over time. Today, self-hosting for me is equal parts habit, convenience, and once-in-a-while stubbornness to stick with open-source solutions. But first, what the heck is self-hosting and how is it any different from running an app on your computer? Honestly, it’s not all that different. Broadly speaking, self-hosting is all about replacing software that is traditionally associated with cloud-hosted tools with applications and services that run on your local hardware. It sounds complicated, and at first it is, but over the years you come to appreciate the freedom it gives alongside the occasional headaches it might bring. Take the bitter with the better, eh?",

Starting next year, if a developer chooses not to verify their identity, Android will prevent their apps from being installed on certified devices (ie. devices with Google Mobile Services). This news sent shockwaves through the enthusiast community, with many criticizing Google for transforming Android into an iOS-like walled garden . Google claims its goal is to prevent bad actors from distributing malicious software under a cloak of anonymity. However, many believe the company has an ulterior motive, such as killing emulation on Android or hindering Android-based e-readers . In response, Sameer Samat, President of the Android Ecosystem at Google, said , “Sideloading is fundamental to Android, and it’s not going anywhere.” He added that the company’s new requirements aren’t designed to limit choice but rather to “make sure that if you download an app from a developer, regardless of where you get it, it’s actually from them.”",

Samsung debuted the Galaxy S25 FE this week, but that’s not the last smartphone the company is expected to announce this year. The tech giant also has a multi-fold device, popularly but misleadingly called a “tri-fold,” due later this year. Last week, a few 2D animations related to the device leaked, showing off some of its wireless features. Now a new official-looking animation has leaked, revealing something else about the handset. This leak comes from the same X (formerly Twitter) user who released last week’s animations, @TechHighest . In this particular video, we see how the Galaxy foldable will open and close. Based on this animation, if you’re looking at the external display, it appears that the device opens outward with the left side starting first and the right side after that.",

Counterpoint Research has published its foldable phone market share report for Q2 2025, and it turns out HUAWEI was on top with a 45% share. This is a significant boost from a year ago, when it held 32% of the market. The tracking firm attributed these results to the Chinese market, saying it accounts for the majority of foldable phone shipments globally. Furthermore, foldable shipments in general saw a 45% year-on-year increase.",

Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

Google’s Pixel lineup has an unfortunate history of being unable to make 911 calls, a statement that doesn’t incite confidence at all. Reports first emerged in 2021 about Pixels being unable to connect to 911, and the issue was traced to a Microsoft Teams bug and fixed in 2022. More 911 call failure reports emerged in 2023 on Pixels, but Google never acknowledged the problem or publicly issued a fix. It seems even the Pixel 10 series cannot make 911 calls reliably, and that’s frankly scary at this point. Reddit user YellowWidget had to call 911 for an emergency.

    "body": "AI-powered smart glasses are all the rage nowadays. However, despite their potential, one of the main issues with smart glasses is their appearance and feel. Most are usually big, bulky, made with plastic to keep the weight low, and have large stems to hold all the tech. It all adds up to quite an uncomfortable experience and often looks out of place. That is the most significant pain point that Dymesty addresses with its AI Glasses. Dymesty created AI glasses that professionals would genuinely desire to wear daily, with exquisitely crafted frames and sophisticated always-on functionality. Rejecting clunky plastics and poor ergonomics, Dymesty fused premium eyewear design with cutting-edge AI — resulting in an experience as beautiful as it is intelligent. Here’s what you need to know.",

The feature is officially called Scroll and Translate, and according to Google’s blog post , it’ll roll out this week on Android, starting with select Samsung Galaxy devices.",

For the manual approach, the F25 Ultra stick vac taps into the power of steam. Old-fashioned chores are going the way of the dodo, and modern smart home devices are getting better and better at taking care of life’s little annoyances that we’d rather just someone (or something) else handle. Roborock already offers an impressive selection of vacuums, from autonomous robotic units to capable stick vacs, and now it’s not only delivering new options there, but expanding into uncharted territory: robotic lawn care. RockMow Z1, S1, and RockNeo Q1 are tailored to yards of all sizes",
