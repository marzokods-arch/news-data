Once again, Nothing has turned to social media to offer more information about its next flagship TWS earbuds . This time, the company has revealed the launch date for the Nothing Ear (3). As it turns out, we’ll only have to wait a little over a week for the official announcement. According to the post, Nothing will launch the new earbuds on September 18, which is next Thursday.",

The suggestion prompts help users explore topics and engage in in-depth conversations to get more out of their AI interactions. The feature seems to be a limited test for now. If you’re old enough to have used search engines before their AI-fication, you’re most likely using your AI digital assistant more like a search engine and less like a digital assistant. That means more one-off queries and fewer conversations, which is the way many of us are used to Googling. The approach is not wrong, but an AI assistant can do much more than run a simple one-off search query for you. Google appears to be testing a new feature within Gemini that encourages users to ask follow-up questions and keep the conversation going by giving them prompts on what they could ask further. With Google app v16.34.58, Telegram user @blank94855 spotted that Google is testing a new feature within Gemini where the AI-based digital assistant will suggest follow-up questions based on your original query.",

The new lens supposedly has a narrower f/2.8 aperture, a downgrade from the OnePlus 13’s f/2.6 aperture. Another possible leak suggests the OnePlus 15 might be cheaper due to cost-cutting measures, including a different display and the end of the Hasselblad partnership. OnePlus makes some excellent Android flagships , and the current generation OnePlus 13 checks all the right boxes, so we’re very excited to see what the company has in store for its successor, the OnePlus 15 (Chinese culture regards the number “4” as unlucky). The company recently confirmed that its Hasselblad partnership is over, and that it is building its own DetailMax Engine for photography. Now, more specifications of the OnePlus 15’s camera have leaked, and there’s both good and bad news. Leaker Digital Chat Station has shared that the OnePlus 15 could come with a 50MP periscope telephoto camera. This camera could have an 85mm equivalent focal length and f/2.8 aperture.",

For instance, multiple Pixel 10 users have reported running into a screen snow issue that automatically fixes itself. As luck would have it, we at Android Authority have also faced the screen snow issue on our Pixel 10 Pro XL. My colleague Paul Jones faced the issue with his new Pixel 10 Pro XL while casually browsing YouTube.

We also get a look at the S26 Edge, and this render lines up with a previous image. We got a first look at the Galaxy S26 Edge late last week, showing a tweaked design compared to the Galaxy S25 Edge . Now, a different source has revealed renders apparently showing all three Galaxy S26 series models. SmartPrix posted renders that purportedly show the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra . Starting with the Edge model, this design seems broadly in line with the earlier leaked renders. That means two vertically stacked rear cameras in a housing that spans almost the full width of the phone.",

At the time of signing up for these services, it seemed like the obvious thing to do. After all, if the delivery guy needs to find my address, he’ll have to call me for assistance. Plus, it makes sign-in so much easier on services that default to phone numbers. As harmless as this seems, it’s opened up a world of pain for me. Once your phone number is in the hands of a business, it stops being yours. For years my phone has been cluttered with spam texts, unwanted messages, and more robocalls than I know how to handle. I’d be pulling out my hair if it weren’t for call screening services like TrueCaller. But even the best of these is far from perfect. The point is, the number that was supposed to connect me with family, friends, and colleagues is now up for grabs as a target for digital advertising. And I didn’t sign up for that. But despe…",

I visited the BOOX booth today hoping to take another look at its great e-readers like the Palma 2 , but ended up getting a surprise early preview of the next generation of Palma, with a couple major upgrades in tow. Electronic paper displays have been nothing short of a revolution, and their ultra-low power demands, image retention capabilities, and exceptionally eye-friendly output have formed the foundation of the e-reader industry. We’ve come a long way from the early days of the Kindle, and companies like BOOX have continuously pushed the tech to new places with things like stylus input, color screens, and useful new form factors.",

For starters, it makes it easy to hot swap batteries on the go, so you can carry multiple and switch them if your phone dies mid-day. Also, batteries degrade over time, and today’s standard solution is to take them to a professional to replace them. With removable batteries, this process is as simple as ordering a new battery and sticking it into the phone yourself.",

Gemini didn’t have an equivalent to this, and despite having the paid subscription, I had to go to ChatGPT for that.

But while the on-device LLM can do a lot, when it comes to heavy lifting, Google wants you to pop over into the Gemini app. More specifically, Gemini Pro . And to drive that point further, Google bundles in a free year of the Gemini AI Pro plan with the phone. The perk is designed to funnel you into recurring payments, and storage is the bait. In fact, I’d go as far as saying that the free year of Gemini Pro and 2TB of cloud storage are a key part of Google’s marketing to make the phone appear like a bargain. Two terabytes of cloud storage, access to Google’s best AI features, including Deep Research with Gemini 2.5 Pro.

They say competition is good for the consumer, and never has that been felt more by the Android gaming handheld community than in the past few weeks. First, AYANEO and AYN released competing dual-screen clamshells in the same week, with the AYN Thor coming in slightly cheaper. Now, AYANEO has flipped the tables. In a product sharing session this morning, AYANEO announced pricing on its upcoming KONKR Pocket FIT handheld. The standard model, which has a Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, will start at $239 for the 8+128GB model.

Initially, it was mostly curiosity and tinkering. That changed over time. Today, self-hosting for me is equal parts habit, convenience, and once-in-a-while stubbornness to stick with open-source solutions. But first, what the heck is self-hosting and how is it any different from running an app on your computer? Honestly, it’s not all that different. Broadly speaking, self-hosting is all about replacing software that is traditionally associated with cloud-hosted tools with applications and services that run on your local hardware. It sounds complicated, and at first it is, but over the years you come to appreciate the freedom it gives alongside the occasional headaches it might bring. Take the bitter with the better, eh?",

For all the promise they offer, projectors have been plagued since day one by compromise after compromise — they may deliver big-screen thrills, but at what cost? Maybe you’ve been let down by poor brightness, resulting in a washed-out picture, or distracting rainbow effects from the way they cycle colors.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority A hidden YouTube TV promotion is offering to take $33 off your monthly bill. The promotion lasts for two months, meaning you can save $66. You’ll need to use a web browser to access the promotion. Earlier this year, YouTube TV raised its subscription price from $72.99 to $82.99. But before this price hike went live, the service offered a six-month-long price lock that allowed users to delay paying that additional $10 per month. While that promotion has expired, there’s a new promotion that users can activate to save some money. On YouTube TV, you can find a deal that will save you up to $66 on your subscription. Specifically, the promotion will take $33 off your monthly bill for two months. After a Reddit user (via ZDNET ) spotted the promotion, a large number of other users confirmed they had the deal waiting for them as well.",

Google has just dropped a new set of merchandise in succession of the Pixel 10 series phones announced last month. The newly added products include a coffee mug, a full-sleeve T-shirt, and a roll of washi tape. All of these products are available in black and have a series of binary numbers printed on them. I asked Google Lens to scan and interpret these numbers for me, and I was informed that it reads “72 101 108 111 33” in decimal digits. Without me asking, the built-in AI also interpreted that these numbers represented the positions of various English alphabet letters in the list of ASCII characters, so I didn’t have to use my own brain cells trying to decode them.",

Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

Google’s Pixel lineup has an unfortunate history of being unable to make 911 calls, a statement that doesn’t incite confidence at all. Reports first emerged in 2021 about Pixels being unable to connect to 911, and the issue was traced to a Microsoft Teams bug and fixed in 2022. More 911 call failure reports emerged in 2023 on Pixels, but Google never acknowledged the problem or publicly issued a fix. It seems even the Pixel 10 series cannot make 911 calls reliably, and that’s frankly scary at this point. Reddit user YellowWidget had to call 911 for an emergency. Unlike previous Pixels, the call went through. However, the user only heard what they describe as “garbled beeps, shrill electronic screeches, and the occasional ghost of a human word buried in the noise.” The user tried four times, but faced the same issue.…",

You only get the discounted price for two months, but a $66 benefit is better than none. If you’ve switched over from a traditional cable TV, you probably know about virtual providers like YouTube TV, DirecTV, or Hulu. However, if you haven’t and want to explore cutting ties with a traditional TV operator, YouTube TV could be one of the more beneficial options. The base pack starts at $82.99, which isn’t cheap but feels justified for the features it offers . And for its existing customers, YouTube TV is introducing a new discount offer that saves $33 per month. Reddit user oestred recently discovered a discount offer that reduces the monthly cost to $49.99, resulting in a $33 monthly savings. However, you must note that the offer applies only for two months, and your subscription costs will revert to the original price from the third month onwards. Despite that, it doesn’t sound like a bad deal, but you must act quickly, since we don’t know how long the offer will last.",

The Galaxy S25 FE has officially launched and is up for sale right now, starting at $649. If you’re an AT&amp;T customer, you’ll be able to save some money on the Fan Edition device with the carrier’s new deal. If you’re thinking of picking up the Galaxy S25 FE, AT&amp;T is offering the device for $5.99 per month. Anyone on an unlimited plan can hop on this deal for a savings of 66% ($435). No trade-ins are required to take advantage of this offer. According to the fine print, this deal is for the 128GB model, so you’ll be out of luck if you want the higher storage option.",

Google’s support page still lists the Pixel 9 series as the only officially supported hosts. The tool lets you use another Pixel or GoPro as a remote camera for livestreams in apps like YouTube and TikTok. Google’s Connected Cameras feature is handy for turning another Pixel phone or GoPro into a remote camera for livestreams. It was initially billed as a Pixel 9-exclusive feature, but we’ve spotted signs of it starting to appear on older models as well. A Pixel 8 Pro owner on Reddit says they’re now seeing the Connected Cameras toggle in their settings, and they’re not alone. In Telegram groups, others report the same on the Pixel 6a and Pixel 7 beta builds. That’s at odds with Google’s support page , which still lists the Pixel 9 lineup as the only devices that can host the feature.",
