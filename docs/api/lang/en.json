View this post on Instagram Among the first to publicly pay tribute was Brent Smith of Shinedown, who shared a video message recalling how 3 Doors Down helped his band early in their career. “You guys were the first band that ever took us out on the road,” Smith said, referencing Shinedown’s opening slot for 3 Doors Down in 2003. “Brad was always kind, always encouraging, and always real.” He captioned the post: &#8220;Thank you for the music.

Newsom later amplified his support with a tongue-in-cheek follow-up message, describing himself as “a tremendous lover of the Spanish” and “a huge fan of Puerto Rico,” before adding, “We love Bad Bunny! He is nearly as ‘hot’ as me — which is a big compliment, because there is nobody hotter. Happy Bad Bunny Day, America.” Support also came from Tim Cook, who praised the artist on social media ahead of the game in a selfie with the singer to social media. Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, is set to deliver an all-Spanish halftime performance at Levi’s Stadium during Super Bowl LX, marking one of the most prominent Spanish-language showcases in the event’s history.
