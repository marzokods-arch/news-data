The sequel to the superb underwater survival game has yet to appear, though, and the founders of Unknown Worlds have been ousted by owner Krafton, leading to a messy legal dispute between the two parties. One of the reasons given for the termination was the state of the game. The founders believed that it was ready for an early access launch and planned to go through with it; Krafton, meanwhile, believed it wasn't ready for its debut and that the founders had been shirking their duties . But there's been a surprising U-turn, with Krafton significantly changing its argument. The lawsuit is now in the discovery phase, so Fortis Advisors, which represents the ousted founders, sought discovery to see if Krafton held evidence to back up its claims. \"But despite its obvious relevance, Krafton feigned astonishment during the parties' meet and confers at how it could possibly be part of Phase I,\" Fortis said. Essentially, Krafton said that documents relating to the readiness of the game were irrelevant to the termination—which is what this phase of discovery is focused on—despite this being the re…",

That's due in part to the fact people can create and share content for the platform and, crucially, make a bit of money off it. These breakout hits, like Steal a Brainrot , are completely beyond my understanding (I still remember cassette tapes and Nokia brick phones), but there's no denying their utter chokehold over the gaming youth. \"Hey,\" says Fortnite, \"we want a bit of that pie!\" While Fortnite's had its own creator tools for a minute—you can create an 'island', essentially your own map and game-mode, then earn cash based on engagement—creators will, for the first time, be able to rake in the moolah directly from in-game item sales on their islands. As explained in this blog post , beginning in December of this year, creators will be able to make 100% of the \"V-Bucks value from sales in their islands\" until the end of 2026, after which it'll be 50%.

And let me tell you, I am so, so terribly glad to have found out that you can reset all of your cooldowns easily before I did—see, if you're targeting a specific weapon, you might be making use of Moxxi's Encores to merk the same boss over and over again until you're drowning in a sea of purps (and, naturally, not the goddamn weapon/shield you came there for). Once you get a rhythm going, this loot loop can get pretty efficient, all but for one thing: Your cooldowns don't reset, and depending on your build, that might slow down your progress significantly. Even my current build, which makes use of a Repkit with cooldown reduction to keep my Peacebreaker Cannons (now horrifying elemental lasers) bumped up into this.

The idea being, if you bring together both companies' tech, it's possible to deliver something more flexible, more desirable than either company can deliver on its own. The benefits for the two companies are clear enough. Nvidia needs processors for GPU-accelerated server racks, and despite its best efforts to buy Arm, that fell through, dashing any hope of becoming a fully-integrated hardware company with it. Intel needs a helping hand in a few ways. The company is struggling with a falling share price and recently struck a deal with the US government to buy a share of the business, and getting an in with one of the richest companies on the planet isn't a bad get. Though supercharging its processors with more capable and powerful graphics chips has a few big benefits, too. To some degree in gaming, sure, but mostly AI. \"I think these are going to be revolutionary products.

The announcement also broke the news of a $5 billion investment by Nvidia into Intel's common stock, at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. According to sources speaking to The New York Times , the Trump administration approached Nvidia in January and asked it to invest in the chipmaker. The US government has since made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel itself, which is now estimated to be worth $13 billion as a result of Intel's share price rising by near 23% off the back of yesterday's news. Writing on Substack, US semiconductor industry analyst Alex_Intel notes that Intel's chief financial officer stated that the company wasn't seeking any more stake sales at a recent Goldman Sachs conference.

Silksong is a game of three acts, and while you can get a few different endings in Act 2 depending on your actions, the \"true\" ending is only available in Act 3 . There's also an optional epilogue you can unlock if you complete a certain quest in said final act. Obviously, this guide will contain spoilers for all of Silksong's endings , so leave now if you want to avoid that. Otherwise, I'll run through each of the endings Hornet can achieve in Pharloom, plus the requirements for each. Silksong ending: Weaver Queen (Image credit: Team Cherry) Requirements : Defeat Grand Mother Silk at the end of Act 2. This is your bog-standard Silksong ending if you complete Act 2 and defeat the final boss, but don't unlock or complete the Silk and Soul quest to gain access to Act 3. In this ending, Hornet binds Grand Mother Silk, taking all of her silk and essentially replacing her as Pharloom's god overlord. The last we see of Hornet is her cocooned in a web of silk, evolv…",

I mean, who would have thought a few years ago that Intel would become financially unstable, dropping projects and thousands of staff , and then randomly announce a sizeable investment from Nvidia and a plan to collaborate on new chips ? Not many folks, that's for sure. Likewise, I should imagine only die-hard Team Red fans at the start of the decade would have predicted that the best choice for a new CPU , regardless of price point or use scenario, would be an AMD processor. And yet, all of the above have come to pass, and in the case of the last point, we've decided it's time to change our recommendation for the best budget gaming CPU. That honour used to go to Intel's Core i5 13400F , but no longer, as AMD's Ryzen 5 7600X is the sensible choice. (Image credit: Future) There's nothing actually wrong with the 13400F, as such, it's just that the 7600X is simply a better option. It's faster in games, and because it uses AMD's AM5 processor socket, you get far superior upgrade options.

This came through most strongly from my discussion with Tiago Sada, chief product officer at Tools for Humanity . This company makes 'Orb' iris scanners for World , a Sam Altman co-founded company that's looking to create a global network of verified humans. The idea with proof-of-human/liveness detection is to, well, detect and prove that you're human, the goal being to combat bots on online services—even services such as gaming. Sada thinks that having some form of this tech across the board is inevitable: \"I think, if you look far ahead enough, let's say, like, five or 10 years, I have a lot of conviction that every single thing we do on the internet—whether it's a game, an app, a website—it will require proof-of-human.

On that front, thankfully, Intel says things are business as usual. An Intel spokesperson has supplied a statement to the media saying that: \"collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings\" (via PC World and Hot Hardware ). That's pretty unambiguous, at least for the short term. Intel's roadmap, to be clear, currently includes at least two new generations of processor containing its Arc Xe3 iGPUs: Panther Lake and Nova Lake. The former should launch relatively soon, will be mobile (ie, laptop)-only, and will at least in part be made using the company's new 18A node—although early yields apparently aren't looking too promising . The latter will arrive later and should have both desktop and mobile options, just like current-gen Arrow Lake, and looks to be made on TSMC's N2 node.

That's good news for Resident Evil fans who might otherwise be a bit wary about yet another new Resi movie—the film franchise was already rebooted once, just four years ago, with the thoroughly mid Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Cregger's track record, though based on a small sample size (at least when it comes to feature films) is a good reason to be optimistic. And for those wondering which game and characters this new Resi movie will be based on, it looks like the answer is: none of them. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Cregger confirmed that while the 2026 film will take place in the Resident Evil universe, \"It's an entirely original story,\" instead of being based on any one specific game. Cregger is also steering away from major Resident Evil characters like Leon S. Kennedy. \"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story. I think that would be presumptuous,\" Cregger told EW . \"But I respect the games enough where I'm gonna tell a Resi…",

The latest development in the Pocketpair proceedings might be Nintendo's worst look yet, because the company has reportedly decided that modders' ideas don't count. Cool! Thanks to the efforts of a Tokyo contributor who was able to review the case file for the ongoing Pocketpair lawsuit, videogame patent law site Games Fray (which broke last week's Nintendo patent story) reports that part of Pocketpair's defense against Nintendo's lawsuit aims to invalidate Nintendo's patent claims based on the existence of prior art in mods. (Image credit: Pocketpair / Toasted Shoes / The Pokemon Company) As IP attorney Kirk Sigmon told PC Gamer last September, demonstrable prior art—meaning preexisting work resembling the invention described in a patent's claims—is bad news for patent holders, because it means they shouldn't have been granted the patent in the first place. Sigmon said that courts in Japan have a strong history of siding with patent lawsuit defendants who…",

The lower depths introduce more challenging enemies and random Nightlords, but balance this difficulty with powerful new weapon and relic effects that seriously open up the game's buildcrafting. \"I grinded up to depth five this past week,\" Ongbal wrote in the video description. \"And well… honestly it's not enjoyable at higher depths.\" Ongbal accomplished this solo run as John Darksouls himself, Wylder. Despite the YouTuber's predilection for katanas and Sekiro, Ongbal only favored the Sekiro-parrying samurai character, Executor, early on, with his videos quickly transitioning to focus on Wylder gameplay.

Prompted by a 2020 Guardian article that asked experts why some gamers naturally prefer inverted controls—even if some of us consider it an affront to both ethical convention and good taste—visual perception and cognitive neuroscience researchers Dr Jennifer Corbett and Dr Jaap Munneke surveyed hundreds of remote subjects to study the neurological implications of controller inversion preference.

It's hidden way, way off in a section of the map you might not explore until late in the game. I was level 9 before I found it (and I finished the game at level 13), so I spent most of the game without it.

The Ryzen 5 7600X3D chip in the OcUK Mach 5R excited me because it feels like a perfect compromise pick. You're still getting that sweet, sweet 3D V-Cache technology and the gaming performance boosts that come with it, but at a lower price point than usual, which allows you to throw a little more cash at the points that really matter to you. Being a six-core CPU with 96 MB of L3 cache, it's sort of like a Ryzen 7 7800X3D (the CPU in my home rig) but with two fewer cores and a lower clock speed. When it launched late last year, it was initially a US-only Micro Center exclusive, with limited availability. In a rig like this, one with a beefy GPU but at a mid-range price point, getting 3D cache for the cheapest possible seems like a smart play. I was initially worried that games like Borderlands 4, whose official system specs name an eight-core CPU as a minimum , would mean the rig would be bottlenecked. Turns out,…",

    "body": "Borderlands 4 might just be the best game in the whole 16-year-old series, trapped in a prison of terrible choices—choices that didn't stop me from losing 47 hours of my life to a blissfully loot-driven blur. Which leads me to two conclusions: Either my brain is truly broken, or the core loop in BL4's clunky heart is seriously that strong. Need to know What is it?: The latest looter-shooter by Gearbox Software, where you run, gun, and grind your way across the prison planet Kairos. Expect to pay: $69.99 / £59.99 Developer: Gearbox Publisher: 2k Games Reviewed on: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060, AMD Ryzen 7 5800 8-Core Processor, 16GB RAM, Force MP600 SSD. Multiplayer?: Up to 4-player co-op. Link: Official site This is not a series that innovates, and I don't think Gearbox has reinvented the wheel here, either. What the studio has done is make the perfect wheel, then presumably gone \"crap, we spent all our budget on wheel\" and put it on a clunky used car with steering that keeps locking up. I make this assumption because the game's most glaring issues are such blunders that I simply cannot fathom how they happened—they are legitimately baffling. And yet, I've never felt so utterly absorbe…",

So you can bet how excited I was when I got my mitts on Corsair's new 36 ( thirty-six! ) gram gaming mouse, the Sabre V2 Pro. I first saw the Corsair Sabre V2 Pro at Gamescom, but I was told I couldn't speak about it until its launch today. Which, let me tell you, was a difficult ask, because it's thirty-six grams , for pity's sake. How can I keep quiet about a 36 g, non-holey, wireless gaming mouse that seemed—based on my few minutes using it back then—pretty comfortable? Somehow I kept it zipped, though, and I've now had some more time with the mouse. Not enough for a complete picture, mind, just a couple of hours dusting off the cobwebs in a Dust_2 deathmatch last night. And as I suspected, I am smitten, just like I was with the Logitech G Pro X Superlight when that launched. Back then, circa 2020–2021, the Superlight stunned me because it's a wireless mouse that managed to weigh in at just 63 g without the whole holey thing going on. I'm not even a trypophobe, I just like my mice nice and, er, whole, th…",

Oh, and Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel. Hold that thought. The announcement says the partnership will span both enterprise-class AI products and consumer PCs. It's the latter we're most interested in, of course, so here's what the statement has to say about that specifically: \"For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.\" And that really is it, barring some platitudes rolled out by Intel and Nvidia's CEOs, Lip Bu Tan and Jensen Huang respectively. So, what are we to make of it all? It's a pretty extraordinary announcement and it almost certainly wouldn't be happening if Intel wasn't in such deep trouble of late.

Already, we've found the reprised iconic Doom-inspired Hellwalker shotgun, the pleasantly-named Rainbow Vomit that covers all your elemental needs, and the Slippy , a fish grenade. Of all the 150-odd legendaries discovered so far, though, one has taken the cake as the most ridiculous: the Kickballer . When paired with a Jakobs licensed part and enhancement, you can get this shotgun to infinitely bounce projectiles around the room, nuking everything on the screen. More often than not, that also includes you, which can get pretty awkward as there's usually nothing left standing for you to kill to revive yourself. But what if I told you that there was another way? Some other shotgun that does brain-breaking damage that won't kill you in the process, and is somehow a random-ass purple item?

For all you Elden Ring fans out there, think of it a little like getting infected with the Flame of Frenzy—you can get a unique ending, or return to normal via a questline.
