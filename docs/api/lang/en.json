Across the bottom of the image is the phrase that appears to be the title of her upcoming single, &#8220;Eyes Closed,&#8221; which is accompanied by another tantalizing tease in the caption, &#8220;a duet is near.&#8221; At press time no release date or additional information on who JISOO may be dueting with on the track was available. The new song would be JISOO&#8217;s first new solo material outside of the group since she dropped her debut solo EP, Amortage , in February on her own Blissoo/Warner Records imprint.

Conceptually, this is a fascinating subject, because dividing money fairly among rights holders may depend on having after-the-fact control of training data created by the initial license. But which rights holders get paid, and how much? Right now, the popular way to look at this issue is to think about what’s fair: how conceptually important songs are compared to recordings, what kind of popularity can be used as a proxy for AI training — that kind of thing. I am sorry to say, although by now it should be obvious, that none of this will matter much. Music and technology companies tend to operate by litigating, lobbying and leveraging their influence. When certain interests align — labels and artists both want to make money, for example — the result can be fair.

    "body": "Twenty years before Taylor Swift &#8216;s &#8220;The Fate of Ophelia&#8221; was recorded, a character named Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) was leaning into his uniqueness with a magnificently awkward dance routine, as seen in a memorable scene from the 2004 coming-of-age comedy Napoleon Dynamite . His sweet moves were soundtracked by Jamiroquai&#8217;s &#8220;Canned Heat,&#8221; but anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen the movie &#8212; and who happens to stumble upon the fan-made &#8220;Ophelia&#8221; x Napoleon Dynamite mashup making the rounds &#8212; just might think the choreo was meant to be paired with Swift&#8217;s 2025 single instead. Because it&#8217;s actually perfect. Swift fan @betterspiritsprintco on Instagram posted the funny edit on Friday (Oct. 3), the release day of the pop star&#8217;s twelfth studio album, The Life of a Showgirl , which is already setting records ; as of press time on Sunday, the Instagram post has been liked by more than 63,000 Instagram accounts.

Written and directed by Swift herself, the music video for &#8220;The Fate of Ophelia&#8221; made it online Sunday night (Oct. 5). The reference-filled visual has the pop star playing several parts, or showing several sides &#8212; among them the once ill-fated Ophelia of William Shakespeare&#8217;s Hamlet , the lead in a Golden Age Hollywood movie musical, a frontwoman to a 1960s girl group, and the modern Swift showgirl that audiences know and love. Of course, Swift&#8217;s single imagines an Ophelia who makes her way out of a destined tragic ending. In the accompanying music video (seen below), Swift crawls out of an on-set version of a Sir John Everett Millais painting circa the 1850s that famously depicts Ophelia&#8217;s drowning. She performs different iterations of a &#8220;Fate of Ophelia&#8221; show &#8212; in homage to the likenesses of Marilyn Monroe in one scene and Ronnie Spector/The Ronettes in another, and center soundstage in an Anything Goes -inspired ensemble &#8212; and ends up so…",
