Well, it achieved the seemingly impossible, improving upon X-COM: Enemy Unknown . Firaxis' refinement of Julian Gollop's groundbreaking original seemed like a perfect distillation, retaining the essence of what made Gollop's game great—the tension, the heartbreak, that feeling of squaring off against overwhelming odds—while also ironing out many of the kinks present in that original design.

You seeing what I'm seeing? The difference is small, but the effect is huge. In The Outer Worlds 2, which I finally got around to playing this week after hearing great things , I don't feel like a real person while moving around. I feel like a camera, perfectly hovering in place and magically stabilized as I plop one foot in front of the other. It's as if Adam Jensen installed gimbals in his eyeballs. I'm talking about headbob : the subtle camera movement of first-person games that mimics the body's natural bob as it walks or runs. Headbob is so established and omnipresent in first-person games that it's rare we have an occasion to acknowledge it. When headbob comes up, it's usually because a game has too much of it. The Outer Worlds 2 has no headbob. Zero , unless you're sprinting. Your neck is totally detached from the motion of your body, and it's driving me up the wall. It's distracting, ugly, and comes off as a totally unforced error. I didn't realize just how necessary head jostling is to beli…",

Anthropic's adverts criticise ads being introduced to ChatGPT, and describe it as a \"betrayal\" of users. I regret to inform you all that the irony metre has officially smashed. It has gone off the scale. First thing to say is, the ads are also good: I'd recommend watching one or two first, while thinking about OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's face the first time he saw them. To take one example, embedded above, an AI user asks a bot (a middle-aged woman, in the ad) how to communicate better with his mother. When he asks what to do if the advice doesn't work out, the \"AI\" recommends a site for dating mature women where \"cubs\" can find \"cougars.\" Each ad ends with the same sting: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\" As if it couldn't get better, this is backed by the refrain from Dr Dre's What's the Difference, which goes \"What's the difference between me and you?\" Look, I know it's marketing, I know they've \"won\" by ge…",

That's probably why he was set to headline this year's Game Developers Conference as its keynote speaker. But with GDC now just a month away, there's bad news for the conference and everyone hoping to hear what he had to say, because he's not going to be there. Word of the last-minute withdrawal came from the Kojima Productions X account: (Image credit: Kojima Productions (Twitter)) \"We regret to inform you that Hideo Kojima will no longer be able to attend this year's GDC Festival of Gaming,\" the message says. \"We understand that this will be disappointing for fans and attendees who were looking forward to hearing him speak, and we want to offer our deepest apologies. While Hideo Kojima is unable to attend in person, Kojima Productions is still excited to be part of this year's festival, with members of the team presenting during the week.\" A reason for the sudden change in plan wasn't given, so my initial thought went to the recent GDC State of the Game Industry Report, which found that nearly one-third of non-US game develope…",

I bring this up because Botany Manor sounds very much like my kind of puzzle game—lots going on, but not too intellectually taxing—and it's free right now on the Epic Games Store . Botany Manor is a cozy first-person puzzle game that casts players as botanist Arabella Greene, who despite her apparent retirement is exploring a Victorian manor in the late 19th century in order to complete her botanical research book. It's got a little bit of a Witness vibe, maybe some Blue Prince , but unlike those games (neither of which I came close to finishing) the goal in this one isn't to make you feel bad for not being smart. \"We have put a lot of thought into this game because it has a very nice peaceful setting,\" lead developer Laure De May told us in 2024 , just ahead of Bo…",

People will glom onto anything and everything that seems to be even tangentially related to Half-Life 3, and the latest rumour doing the rounds was no exception. The Valve fan account GabeFollower posted a new YouTube video claiming that this time it was actually, definitely happening, including a claim that the project is so done-and-dusted that Valve had begun moving its devs onto other projects. So far, so Sunday morning, though for whatever reason this claim was picked up and reported on by several outlets. Now: any games developer reading the above is probably laughing themselves silly.

The last ten years of Overwatch have certainly been a tumultuous ride, but I've stayed on nevertheless, because throughout it all, I always had confidence in Team 4 that they could learn from mistakes and put their best foot forward. And they have done, not only during the latest Overwatch spotlight , which blew everyone away, myself included, but multiple points over the last few years. The introduction of perks and Stadium last year, alongside map voting and hero bans , was massive for the game. Somehow Stadium manages to feel like an entirely different beast while also being approachable enough for Overwatch players to just pick up whenever, with even more changes coming soon to help its accessibility. Perks may have seemed like a small enough change, but they actually have a huge impact on how fights unfold in Overwatch.

Oh, and they can explode, making them a risk when left next to your bed or in an unmanned part of a plane, so that's not ideal. Luckily, a new breakthrough means we may be able to move on from them. Enter sodium-ion batteries. As reported by Live Science , a new experiment performed by researchers at the Tokyo University of Science has yielded promising results. Lithium-ion batteries work by using a graphite cathode to store the charged lithium ions—this is what actually causes your battery to be charged. Sodium ions need hard carbon instead, and previously, it was found that the sodium ions got jammed when trying to flow into the porous material. Now, I'll admit, the electrical course in my engineering degree was so confusing I decided to switch to film and TV studies, but from what I remember, as ions ent…",

If you go straight to Josee the Blind Hero like I did, you might be a bit underleveled for the fight. You can grind and come back later, but it is possible to beat Josee as soon as you open her cocoon. It just takes some practice. Here's what you need to know to slay Josee the Blind Hero in Code Vein 2. Josee the Blind Hero phase one (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Before getting started, make sure you bring De-Snares to this fight. Josee's attacks can inflict Bind and trap you in place. Getting stuck is a death sentence. Josee uses a massive katana that can cover most of the cramped boss arena in a single slash. Her range is the biggest problem for this fight, but her sword has a lot of end lag. Stay close and be aggressive to score some easy strikes in between her combos.

That key can then be used to decrypt files. It's like someone who spots you removing your lock from a locker and putting theirs on instead. Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back.

This week: Stopped being blissfully unaware that a TV sequel to Baldur's Gate 3 was in development. Baldur's Gate 3 is too big for Hasbro to leave alone. We already knew that, despite Larian moving onto greener pastures, Wizards of the Coast and its owner wanted to do a sequel, and we'll almost certainly see a sequel. But first we're getting a TV show , and I can't help but think that's a big mistake. Canon is a weird concept for D&D because it's an entirely player-driven experience. In the Forgotten Realms there are some big, immutable events, like the Time of Troubles, when the gods temporarily became mortal, or the chaos caused by the Absolute, but within those events are countless stories authored by players, a million headcanons and narratives forged around the table.

Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed. A more grounded (literally) take on the classic FPS formula that, to me at least, felt far more like a spiritual successor to the legendary 1993 original.

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules. As the memory supply crisis went further and further into the red, it became clear that a VRAM-stuffed Super refresh in the coming months was unlikely. The RTX 50-series cards we've tested to da…",

Spoilers ahead for Fallout season 2 At the end of the first season, the levels for each of our main characters were slightly skewed, or at least not where you'd expect them to be. Despite being the main character, Lucy only managed to get to level 8, while The Ghoul sat somewhere around level 89, and Maximus managed to reach level 9.

Deadline also reports that the writer and producer has been playing D&D weekly for the past 15 years. Aside from The Last of Us, Mazin is known for HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, as well as a handful of comedy films, including a couple of the Scary Movie parodies and the second two Hangover movies. According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3. The original BioWare RPGs are \"not official source material,\" the site says, but the show can use material from D&D's Forgotten Realms setting in general.

In particular, Burst Break is of huge importance in this fight, so I hope you've been paying attention—jokes, I'll explain how to use Burst Break down below.

Using Burst Break with R (RT on controller), when Yamagata flashes red, will deal big Ki damage (the blue bar below his health), making it easier to stun him and press Y to perform a Grapple that will take a chunk of his health away.

    "body": "If you're like me and have never played Nioh before, Nioh 3 is quite the challenge. Combat is so much faster and more aggressive than something like Elden Ring , with so many abilities to juggle and buttons to press. Add to that enemies and bosses that don't mess around, putting your understanding of these tools to the test, and it can be a lot. I struggled for quite some time trying to brute-force bosses like the Bloodedge Demon and Jakotsu-baba . That was until I did what I should have done ages ago: actually look at my skills, Omnyo box, and weapons. My greatest discovery was the Supreme Parry and Enduring Destruction skills, which I used to kill Jakotsu-baba and clear the Hamamatsu Crucible on my next attempt pretty cleanly. (Image credit: Team Ninja) The Supreme Parry skill recovers 150 health after a successful Burst Break—the style-swapping counter to glowing red attacks. While you still need to get a hang of each enemy's Break attack timings, this slottable skill is perfect for keeping yourself alive in tough fights without eating through your elixirs. You can find this skill book in a red chest in a ruined building between the First Torii Gate shrine and Otemon Gate shrin…",

    "body": "The Samurai style in Nioh 3 is much closer to the methodical, more hardy, planted sword master that you'd expect from a soulslike, at least compared to the shadowy ninja. However, Nioh 3's samurai has one defining factor that makes it hard to get to grips with for newcomers: Ki Pulse. Ki is effectively your stamina, and you'll soon be breathless if you start flailing around as the samurai. So much so that I barely used the warrior early on in favour of the ninja, where I simply overwhelmed the enemy with a flurry of attacks and dodged here, there, and everywhere. The Ki Pulse is how samurai manage their stamina, requiring you to press the right bumper on a controller at the correct time during combos to recover Ki. It's a lot to keep track of, and it doesn't lead to very smooth, impactful samurai combat if you can't do it right. Plus, I'm a sucker for odachis—large, Ki-eating swords—so I was burning through stamina after just a few hits, leaving me defenceless. One early item that really helped me is the Running Water skill , which lets you perform a Ki Pulse by dodging. It's as simple as it sounds, but it's another way to get your stamina back after a combo while also evading att…",

As is typical for the first real boss in any soulslike, Jakotsu-baba is no walk in the park, as I'm sure you've figured out by now. Not only is Jakotsu-baba a real pain by himself, but he's also inside the Crucible—basically a nightmare realm, where any damage you take also decreases your maximum health. What's already a hard fight is now a true test of skill, as every hit you take sets you even further back. But don't worry, after banging my head against Jakotsu-baba, I figured out a few things that make this fight easier. How to beat Jakotsu-baba in Nioh 3 Jakotsu-baba is a mandatory boss at the end of the Hamamatsu Castle Crucible, so you need to beat them to continue the story and progress into later zones.

Because of this, the Bloodedge Demon can be a terror. But before you can even fight the Bloodedge Demon, you need to know where to find it.
