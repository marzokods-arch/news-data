The songs revolve around his relationship with God and his new place in the world after embracing faith. The lyrics, some inspired by proverbs and biblical passages, convey the fervor of his first love with God, without losing his personal touch. DY alternates between melodic singing and rap bars while the songs flow organically like a cohesive set curated by a DJ. The album also addresses social realities, as in “JARDÍN ROJO”: a poetic denunciation of gender violence that serves as a warning to those who suffer in silence. In “JEZABEL Y JUDAS,” DY deploys an intense metaphor about betrayal and evil in disguise, using those two infamous biblical figures.

Or at least, you can pre-order one. The Indiegogo campaign kicked off this morning, and as of writing, it’s already racked up over $50,000 in orders. The device was a big seller when it launched in China last month, so expect that number to climb over the weekend and beyond.",

Trying out beta software means accepting some level of risk, but how much do you really expect to break when running an Android beta? Maybe Google Wallet stops working? Fingerprint sensor shuts down? A few app crashes, sure, but most of the time Google still manages to give us a largely functional piece of software. That may be true, but this week was apparently the exception that proves the rule, as Google was forced to pump the brakes on Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 following reports of some seriously phone-breaking glitches.

A video shared by Tarun Vats on Twitter demonstrates the new effect on a phone running One UI 8.5.

That latter addition is one we’ve seen the app been giving some special attention to this year, building out tools to help you keep them current and surface the right one at the right time .

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile is reportedly running a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer (Promo R339) that began on October 2 and includes many older Android and iPhone models. The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn’t listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer.",

If it’s not upcoming shows being shelved over fears of upsetting just the worst people, it’s news of price hike after price hike driving up your monthly bills.

Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August.

The phone also features special color tuning by camera brand Ricoh and is realme’s first phone with a special partnership. Innovation is dead, one could easily argue in the context of phone designs. In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design. At the same time, certain outliers, like Nothing, challenge that notion by experimenting with unusual camera designs , secondary displays , and unusually tiny screens . Now, another leading Android manufacturer is experimenting with a subtle change that can radically alter the phone’s look by altering how the camera appears. OnePlus’ sister brand, realme, has just begun teasing its upcoming flagship with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 . In addition to the new chipset, the realme GT 8 Pro is also the brand’s first phone to feature a camera developed in partnership with a ca…",

I highly rate the Find X8 Pro — my current daily driver — in no small part for its stunning pictures. But OPPO plans to take things up a gear this year with a new 200-megapixel telephoto camera, co-developed with Hasselblad once again. The company also has a Hasselblad telephoto extender lens that takes the 200MP camera’s 3.3x zoom / 70mm focal length and blasts it up to a longer-range 9.6x zoom with an equivalent 230mm focal length. Paired with crops and upscaling from that huge 200MP camera, it can take photos all the way out to 40x (920mm).",

For example, a navigation app could use Live Updates to show your next turn in a status bar chip, or a food delivery app could use it to tell you that your food is about to be dropped off. There’s a lot of potential ways that apps can use the Live Updates feature, but unfortunately, developers had to wait a bit to actually use it.

With these tools, you’ll be able to more precisely edit your AI-generated videos. Veo 3 was first introduced earlier this year, around Google I/O in May. The AI video generator, capable of producing clips from text and images, powers the company’s AI filmmaking tool, known as Flow. Google has now rolled out a newer version of the model, Veo 3.1 , which brings some improvements to Flow, like stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality, and adds some new editing capabilities.

Various glitches and broken routines have tested people’s patience, even among those who’ve stuck by the platform from the start. Google’s hoping its big Gemini for Home upgrade and new hardware will turn things around, but after so many false starts, we wanted to know if people are willing to wait around for that revival. We polled our readers to find out. My colleague Karandeep Singh expressed his personal views on this recently, making his article the perfect place to run our poll. For his part, he admitted his loyalty to Google Home had finally run out. He explained how years of reliability issues and patchy updates had worn him down, and how learning that Gemini for Home won’t launch in India anytime soon was the final straw. Understandable as that is, his geospecific issue won’t apply to many of our readers, and the poll results below suggest that a majority of you are willing to roll the dice with Google’s smart home ecosystem at least one more time.",

T-Mobile has announced that that plan is going away in a few weeks, but it’s offering subscribers a pretty decent consolation.

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",
