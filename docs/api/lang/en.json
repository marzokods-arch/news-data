Earlier this month, J Balvin announced a capsule collection with bags and accessories brand Vélez, and Kenia Os surprised fans with the launch of her very own perfume called KOS Muse with soft notes of wood and vanilla.&nbsp; Meanwhile, for the aficionado who appreciates a good album, we suggest Carlos Vives’ La Tierra del Olvido vinyl, which has been remastered and expanded for the set’s 30th anniversary.

Google’s also considering some reorganization for a few of Gemini’s menu options. AI tools like Gemini have proven their usefulness in plenty of situations, but despite their flexibility, sometimes we’re going to want to keep our interactions with them really focused and compartmentalized. That’s exactly why ChatGPT supports projects: smart workspaces that keep all your conversations and files for what you’re working on siloed up together. Earlier this year we spotted Gemini working on what looked like a similar project solution of its own , and now we’ve got a little progress to share.

Stretching over the entirety of NIRCam’s field of view, these lobes are shown to be closed, bubble-like structures that each extend about 3 light-years.

Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images.

Credits: NASA/CHAPEA Crew A crew of four research volunteers stepped inside NASA’s CHAPEA (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog) habitat on Oct. 19, marking the start of the agency’s second 378-day simulated Mars mission. Ross Elder, Ellen Ellis, Matthew Montgomery, and James Spicer are living and working inside the roughly 1,700-square-foot 3D-printed habitat at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston until Oct. 31, 2026. “The information and lessons learned through CHAPEA will inform real-life mission planning, vehicle and surface habitat designs, and other resources NASA needs to support crew health and performance as we venture beyond low-Earth orbit,” said Sara Whiting, Human Research Program project scientist. &#8220;Through these lessons, NASA&#8217;s Human Research Program is reducing human health and performance risks of spaceflight to enable safe and successful crewed missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyon…",

ESA/DLR/FU Berlin, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO Results from an enhanced radar technique have demonstrated improvement to sub-surface observations of Mars. &nbsp; NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has revisited and raised new questions about a mysterious feature buried beneath thousands of feet of ice at the Red Planet’s south pole. In a recent study, researchers conclude from data obtained using an innovative radar technique that an area on Mars suspected of being an underground lake is more likely to be a layer of rock and dust.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2018 discovery of the suspected lake set off a flurry of scientific activity, as water is closely linked with life in the solar system. While the latest findings indicate this feature is not a lake below the Martian surface, it does suggest that the same radar technique could be used to check for subsurface reso…",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR A malware, called “Sturus,” has emerged, and it exploits Android’s accessibility features to spread on your phone even without you noticing. It gains access to your Android after being installed via an APK file, and then monitors your phone’s interface, chats, and even button presses. It then recreates fake banking app UIs to steal your banking data, and places restrictions that prevent it from being uninstalled. Update, November 25, 2025 (11:27 AM ET): Google has reached out to Android Authority with a statement regarding the Sturnus malware. A spokesperson tells us: Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect , which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.",

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVyfNGZUns I’ve been dipping in and out of classic game emulation for years now, but one trend that I hadn’t really appreciated until recently was the use of “spoof” APK versions that you won’t find in the Google Play Store. In other words, developers are shipping their game emulators disguised as other apps. Why would they do that? Well, it’s all about maximizing performance. The theory is simple: most smartphones optimize for specific use cases, often sacrificing peak performance for many apps to reduce temperatures and prolong battery life. Your web browser doesn’t need to run your chip at full tilt, after all. However, some devices game the system by unlocking maximum performance for listed applications, sometimes for specific games, and occasionally to improve their benchmark results. By “spoofing” one app to appear as another, a developer can trick the system into unlocking maximum performance that might not have been otherwise available. This is pretty handy if you’re trying to emulate something extremely demanding.",

The device itself is lightweight and unobtrusive, with an adjustable stand that tilts the unit up to 160 degrees, meaning you can project onto a ceiling.

    "body": "Credit: Samsung via Amazon Black Friday always brings a few eyebrow-raising discounts, and this Samsung gem is definitely one of them. The 49-inch Odyssey G9 G95C is one of the brand’s most over-the-top gaming monitors, and it has fallen to $777.99 on Samsung’s site, down from $1,299.99. If you’ve been circling the idea of going super-ultrawide, this is the kind of price that makes the jump a lot easier to justify. The Samsung G95C monitor isn’t subtle. It’s a massive 32:9 curved DQHD panel that essentially gives you the screen real estate of two 27-inch QHD monitors stitched together without bezels getting in the way. The steep 1000R curve wraps around your peripheral vision, and paired with its 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and FreeSync Premium Pro, it’s built for fast, fluid gameplay rather than just looking dramatic on a desk.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Pixel 10 Pro users continue to report jerky video when using the telephoto camera, specifically while panning. Google Support claims the issue is fixed, but users continue to complain that the EIS bug persists. As a workaround, you can temporarily fix the stutter by disabling “Video stabilization” in the Pixel Camera settings. We’ve previously covered the Pixel 10 Pro’s jerky zoom videos and how users had to settle for workarounds to get usable video recordings despite paying over $1,000 for a top-tier flagship. The issue has affected users for months, and while customer support has claimed to some users that the problem has been “fixed,” users claim that it still persists. So we want to ask you: Are you still facing issues when recording video with the Pixel 10 Pro’s telephoto zoom? Reddit user No_Particular7571 had previously spotted that their new Pixel 10 Pro shot very jerky video through its telephoto camera, particularly when panning or moving. However, the stuttering completely disappears when you turn off EIS in the Pixel Camera app, indicating there is a bug in Google’s EIS implementation that conflicts with the phone’s OIS.",

After years of teasing and waiting, Spotify finally rolled out Lossless audio a few months ago, allowing Premium subscribers to stream tracks in up to 24-bit/44.1 kHz FLAC quality . The Lossless rollout was long expected to come along with a Premium price hike, but Spotify managed to roll out the better audio quality at the same price.

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s own virtual assistant Bixby may soon be powered by an AI chatbot. Samsung is rumored to have partnered with Perplexity, a Google DeepMind and OpenAI rival, for new Bixby capabilities. These features would be available to Samsung users starting with the Galaxy S26. Bixby, Samsung’s homespun virtual assistant , has always been overshadowed by more popular options such as Gemini , Siri, and Alexa. On other smart devices, such as Samsung TVs and talking refrigerators, Bixby is the default voice assistant. However, on Android devices under Samsung’s Galaxy range, Gemini takes precedence over Bibxy, and Samsung doesn’t oppose either. One of the reasons for Bixby’s lack of popularity is the limited AI features compared to its rivals. However, that could be changing soon — as soon as early 2026, when Bixby might receive a deeper integration of Perplexity’s AI chatbot. According to leaker with the handle @chunvn8888 on X , Samsung is testing Perplexity’s integration into Bixby on its smartphones and tablets. The feature, they say, is set to arrive with the launch of the Galaxy S26 series next year.",

The phenomenon creates powerful changes in the way astronauts think about Earth and life and can be particularly strong for those who lived and worked aboard the International Space Station during its 25 years of continuous human presence. The orbiting laboratory’s cupola module, equipped with seven windows looking down on Earth, provides the perfect place for observation and reflection. NASA astronaut Jessica Watkins is pictured looking out from the International Space Station&#8217;s &#8220;window to the world&#8221; – the cupola. Astronauts use the seven-windowed observation mo…",

However, the unexpected news has certainly left many of us scratching our heads. We first suspected the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) had something to do with it, but since Google essentially went rogue and implemented it without Apple’s help , it seems that’s not the case.

That said, it rather forces the user to adopt this ideology. It’s no wonder then that plenty of users leap for other Android launchers offering fresher features and extensive customization options. Fortunately, it appears that Google is addressing this issue. According to evidence we uncovered in Android Canary, the Pixel Launcher will soon give users the option to hide its At a Glance widget completely from the home screen. The widget, positioned right at the top of the screen, is helpful in certain instances. It serves context-relevant information, including weather forecasts, flight details, and traffic information via Maps for commuters. Not everyone values this information, though, and since At a Glance is permanent, it robs these users of real estate on their home screens.",

I think about all the great Android launchers I’ve tried in the past, all the interesting approaches to finding and interacting with my apps and widgets, and then I accept my fate and stick with the default option, again and again. It’s not that I think the Pixel Launcher is perfect or that the other options don’t have excellent features I envy. Quite the contrary. But there’s something comforting in Google’s approach, so here’s why I stick with it despite knowing there are better options out there.",
