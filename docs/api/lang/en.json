It's not just the fact that, as a generally not small woman, my feet don't touch the ground while sitting in this gaming chair, but also the fact I'm perched atop a 5000 mAh lithium ion battery. Yes, this is a $699 / £580 gaming chair offering an array of features that require a considerable amount of juice. But before we get into all of that, let us ask the most basic question: What is it like as a regular ol' gaming chair? Well, as previously mentioned, the first thing to get out of the way is that this is not really made for me; the XL or Plus edition of the DXRacer Martian Series is intended for folks up to 180 cm tall, and is designed to support a weight of up to 125 kg. But even adjusted to my preferred tilt angle and the lowest possible chair height, my feet don't touch the floor, swinging in the air like a tiny tyrant. To put it another way, this gaming chair is very much pitched towards someone who could easily reach the top shelf. D…",

See, WoW's a wizened beast with expansions in the double digits to its name, and if you keep slapping continents on the old girl, it's going to stop feeling like a World of Warcraft and more like a hodgepodge...er, of Warcraft. Anyway, we know that we're going to get a redesigned Northrend again for the next next expansion , The Last Titan, but Blizzard's also considering taking a new lick of paint to some long-standing cities, too; beloved places that haven't seen an overhaul since Cataclysm which, not to make you feel old or nothin', came out 16 whole years ago. That's per our cover feature for the upcoming issue of PC Gamer, written by PCG contributor Heather Newman. In it, Heather spoke to both manager for visual development Gabriel Gonzalez and Paul Kubit, associate game director and lead on the expansion itself. \"It was a little scary, honestly, to go back in to tackle that zone again,\" says Gonzalez regarding Silvermoon and the Ghostlands, given their nostalgia-drenched pos…",

    "body": "Word reached me this morning that hot new PvP raid shooter Highguard has an unusual bug. According to Steam user Captain_SmellyRat (excellent), the game's resolution is tied to its post processing setting, which means lowering it drops the output resolution in turn—despite reporting otherwise in the settings menu. Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%. Turn post processing to High, and the game runs at full 4K. I tried a few different resolutions to see if the effect scaled down the stack, and yep, post processing Low seems to force the game to run at 80% of its stated resol…",

The main issue is that A Prime Specimen seems to be bugged right now, though I'll explain that below. The first step of A Prime Specimen is to obtain two Arc Powercells. These are the common Arc material used to craft shield charges, so you'll likely already have a stockpile that you can bring into a raid (that's what I did). Otherwise, you can find them on any Arc machine. So, grab two Arc Powercells and head into Blue Gate to find an Arc Deforester. How to complete A Prime Specimen in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) The biggest hurdle in the A Prime Specimen quest is finding and interacting with the Arc Defroster.

Since that time, Valve has actually announced its very own Steam Controller . Yet TommyB says \"that doesn't change anything\" and his controller looks better than ever. It's called the OpenSplitDeck. The new version looks as chunky, if not chunkier, than the one we saw back in June last year.

It now supports gyro controls, much like the Steam Controller, with one gyroscope in each half of the controller. Gyro functionality is, creator TommyB says, \"a little noisy\" at the moment, but he's looking into ways to improve this and use the dual-gyroscopes to better effect in-game. Each half of the controller also features a slim screen down the inside edge. One of the larger overhauls here is a shift away from Arduino to the Nordic nRF Connect SDK.

In Movie Night's most complicated step, Apollo sends you to the Cultural Archives to find the Stack of Movie Tapes, which you'll then have to extract to deliver to him. You'll also need to find a Portable TV , but I'll go over where to find it all below. Where to find the Stack of Movie Tapes in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) You can find the Stack of Movie Tapes in a pile of furniture in the southwest corner of Cultural Archives , to the right of the entrance via the Atrium. Interact with the pile of furniture to find the Stack of Movie Tapes item, which you'll need to collect. As shown in the video below, if you're entering from the Atrium, just head down the stairs into the Cultural Archives and immediately turn right to find some old furniture covered with a white sheet.

Now the company has announced an initial customer for the chip and emphasised that it is the first time it has supplied a CPU as a separate product. Bloomberg reports on a new deal between Nvidia and cloud services outfit CoreWeave that forms the basis of what is effectively the launch of the Vera CPU. In what has become a typically circular form for the AI industry of late, Nvidia is investing $2 billion in Coreweave, while the latter will buy up to $6 billion in Nvidia hardware, including those Vera chips. Bloomberg says the Vera CPU will be competing with server chips from Intel and AMD, along with other cloud computing processors such as Amazon's Graviton. But not all that much is known about Nvidia's Vera CPU. Nvidia has previously said that it runs a new custom-designed Arm core called Olympus.

They went on to explain that they were an avid modder, digging into the guts of games like Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire to tweak the progression curves of player stats⁠—which is about as granular a difficulty modifier as you can get. They further asked for Sawyer's thoughts on the cost/benefit analysis of letting players get so far into the weeds \"officially,\" or at least baking in the modding freedom to do so. \"If it cost nothing⁠—which it does not⁠—then I would say let players in-game set their difficulty options however they like,\" said Sawyer. \"And when it comes to exposing data tables and letting players mod that stuff, let 'em do whatever the heck they want.\" The nature of this question has changed over the course of h…",

It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map. This phase plays out like an accelerated battle royale match—rushing to find better guns and armor, but usually not immediately fighting…",

Progression is still a little stagnant for now as Hytale chips away at early access updates, though the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers is more of what I want to see, even if it feels a little underwhelming. With the fancy book, you can summon undead hordes to smack enemies about and take the pressure off yourself. Well, I say horde, but you've got a limited amount of pages to work with. At full capacity, it's more like a small skeletal squad. You can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians. They aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire only seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments.

FromSoft dusted off the venerable swordsman to serve as a boss in Elden Ring Nightreign's recent Deathly Forsaken Hollows DLC. He's effectively been \"ported\" to Elden Ring's iteration of the FromSoft game engine, allowing Elden Ring Fights to pit him against the Lands Between's finest. And boy, for a battered veteran coming out of retirement, Artorias fares better than all those tomato cans they kept setting up in front of Jake Paul. Artorias went on an absolutely brutal tear through the bosses of Elden Ring: Early terrors like Margit and Godfrey don't stand a chance, with single hits from Abyss Artie chunking their health bars.

And as any farmer's almanac will tell you, the end of winter always brings two things: Asymmetrical combat engagements and an overabundance of avian activity.

The most impactful addition is a new matchmaking option that'll be available for experienced raiders who've reached level 40: Solo vs Squads, offering bonus XP rewards for lone wolves who're willing to risk a fight with a full pack. Whether or not additional XP is enough of a draw to actually get anyone to choose the new matchmaking option is another question.

Official Highguard promotion stopped as soon as it started, which prompted a swell of spectators (largely on X, the misery app) to declare Highguard the next Concord and question if it would be delayed or cancelled outright. Speaking with Wildlight at a hands-on event in Los Angeles last week, several Highguard devs admitted they wished the reveal had gone down differently, but made it clear that the mixed reception didn't alter their release plans. \"Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better,\" Wildlight Entertainment CEO and founder Dusty Welch told PC Gamer. \"Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand.

That's my takeaway from a recent chat that Nightdive CEO (and System Shock Remake director) Stephen Kick had with FRVR . \"They don’t perform financially the same way that other genres do,\" said Kick. \"It’s a known fact, you make an imsim game you’re going to be appealing to a very small, niche group of fans that are going to love it, they’re going to be very vocal about it, and they’re going to try to convince their friends to play it, and they may or not be successful.\" That small, niche group of people is me and, I'd hazard to guess, you. But apparently we don't represent a market demographic large enough to move the C-suites of the world. So why does Nightdive keep working on them?

But there's a significant caveat hanging over the Intel Arc B390, and it goes like this: it's very, very quick— for an iGPU. Sure, it's capable of delivering gaming laptop-like performance, but compare it to any discrete mobile GPU of the current generation and the little graphics tile's limits are quickly revealed. Now, none of this is meant to cast shade upon the considerable achievement of Intel's engineers. No one was expecting its new mobile graphics hardware to compete with, say, anything from the RTX 50-series. In fact, Intel claims the Core Ultra X9 388H is 10% faster at gaming (on average) than a lappy with an RTX 4050 mobile. And, if you squint closely at those claims, you'll see that they were made in reference to a 60 W gaming laptop, with '2x upscaling' enabled.

So consider me downright stupefied that Logitech seems to have raised its price, at least in the US. When I reviewed it, it was going for $100. Now it's going for $120 . To be fair, this is what happened with the original PowerPlay: it started off at $100 and was later raised to $120. But to be equally fair, I don't care, it's still far too expensive considering the downgrade from the first one. In case you don't have a clue what I'm on about, the G PowerPlay pads charge your compatible Logitech mouse—provided it has the charging puck in its underside—simply by resting the mouse on top of it. This means you never have to plug it in to charge ever again. The problem with the second version, though, is it cut back a lot of what made the first so good. In particular, the first one came with two pad toppers rather than one—one hard, one soft.

Intel remains tight-lipped regarding handheld implementations of its impressive new chips, with the only word I've heard on the matter being something shown to the public \"soon\". So, I'm left with little but speculation for now. Still, we can have fun dreaming together, can't we? Handheld gaming PCs are currently in a bit of a weird space, as far as I'm concerned. Sure, there are plenty to choose from, but it's quite telling that the Steam Deck still crops up with regularity as one of the top recommendations. Its APU is really starting to show its age in 2026, and while it still makes a fantastic value proposition, I'd primarily recommend it as an indie gaming machine if you're looking for smooth performance.

Hope you're okay with zombie guts, because the cafeteria's all out of pastrami. (Image credit: Capcom) The three hours of Requiem I played, swapping between a grizzled-but-still-got-it Leon and more fragile newcomer Grace, deftly tiptoed the line between fan service and light touch reinvention. Last time we saw Leon in Resident Evil 4 Remake, Capcom had given him the ability to parry a chainsaw-wielding zombie with his knife, and he's got the same move here with a hatchet—only now when the mad doctor drops his whirring saw it goes skittering down the hallway, blade bouncing off the tile floor. Another zombie picks it up, which is when I realize maybe I can do the same. There's an elegant marriage of character and combat in this short section that introduces Leon: He immediately cracks a corny joke, is completely unfazed by an orderly b…",

Between the two of them, you've now decided that your next gaming laptop is going to be Panther Lake-powered and sport a big GPU from Nvidia, to go with Intel's big Xe3 tile. You're possibly going to be disappointed, then, to know that you're almost certainly not going to see any such lappies coming to market. The reason why is quite simple: it all comes down to the number of available PCIe lanes in the platform controller tile. Intel has two variants of this chiplet: one with 12 lanes (four are Gen 5, eight are Gen 4) and the other with 20 lanes (eight Gen 4, twelve Gen 5). The important thing, though, is that every Core Ultra 300-series processor that has the big 12-core Xe3 iGPU uses the 12-lane platform controller tile. AMD and Nvidia's mobile GPUs are designed to use at least eight PCIe lanes. That doesn't mean you can't fit a discrete GPU alongside a 12-lane PTL chip; it's just that it will leave just four for everything else inside the laptop. The majority of NVMe SSDs require fou…",

It's a dGPU-less machine, which means all the graphics hardware is contained onboard the single Core Ultra X9 388H chip at its heart. Despite this, the built-in Arc B390 iGPU delivers some impressive gaming performance for its size, meaning that laptops powered by Intel's new mobile chips (the ones with chonky iGPUs, anyway) can now reasonably be called gaming laptops.

(Image credit: EEC) To bring you up to speed, 3D V-Cache is AMD's bespoke technology which underlays an extra chunk of L3 cache underneath the processor cores in a Zen 5 CPU package. The benefit of this is that games in particular benefit from all that extra on-die memory, reducing the number of times programs have to dip into slower system memory and therefore boosting frame rates. On chips, such as the Ryzen 9 9800X3D , and the upcoming 9850X3D, that means all eight of the CPU cores get access to a whole lot more cache. But for the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D chips, which have multiple core complex dies (CCD) to accommodate their higher core counts, only one CCD gets the extra cache. With the…",
