This year, Spanish superstar Pablo Alborán and mega producer Julio Reyes Copello participated to show attendees how they create music together during the Billboard -exclusive panel moderated by Billboard Español&#8217;s Sigal Ratner-Arias. &#8220;This is like entering the barrio and leaving the door open, but we take on the challenge with courage,&#8221; Reyes said about creating a song with a live audience at 10 a.m. Following a short Q&amp;A, the two artists, joined on stage by emerging singer Riza, got to work. Together, Alborán and Riza beautifully harmonized over a dreamy, Middle Eastern rhythm that Reyes was creating, and later brainstormed heartfelt lyrics about missing and longing for someone. &#8220;From Julio, I learned not to settle and at the same time to constantly seek emotion in everything I do in the studio,&#8221; Alborán expressed. &#8220;I rarely feel understood. He understands your roots, where you come from, and he does it in a different way … it&#8217;s a luxury to be around him.&#8221; Reyes added: &#8220;We share the same vision of beau…",

The conversation, which reflected the challenges Latin artists face when navigating U.S. immigration procedures, highlighted the stringent requirements for O and P visas — non-immigrant visas specifically designed for artists, athletes, and entertainers — as well as the growing risks tied to delays and denials. Salama DiMitri, a seasoned immigration attorney, emphasized the difficulty and multilayered process of securing these visas for international performers. “Immigration structure is a multi-agency, multistep process.

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",
