It looks like Spotify is prepping a genuinely clever feature that meets bibliophiles and audiobook fans in the middle. It’s something Amazon has already done with ebooks and audiobooks, but Spotify is taking it a step further by not leaving lovers of physical books behind.",

For quite some time now, 5,000mAh has been the standard for smartphone batteries, often leaving users to carry battery banks or use a low-power mode. Now, realme is changing things by launching a smartphone with a huge 10,001 mAh battery, rather than just showing off a concept or a lab prototype. The main feature here is realme’s Titan battery, a 10,001mAh cell that the company says can last a week. The number stands out, but what’s more impressive is how fast realme turned the idea into a real product. After showing a 10,000mAh concept phone last year, the company has now started mass-producing the 10,001mAh battery.",

Only around 100 black units are expected to ship first, with wider shipments starting later in the week. The update follows the Pocket 6’s recent redesign, which reintroduced the handheld with two control layouts. It hasn’t been smooth sailing for Retroid over the last couple of months. After relaunching the Pocket 6 with two different control layouts, early shipments of the Android handheld are now being staggered thanks to a production slowdown tied to its OLED screen. In a Discord update to customers, the company said it will only be able to ship around 100 black Pocket 6 units next Monday, starting with the stick-on-top version. Retroid says the holdup comes down to OLED screen calibration, which has limited how many units it can get out the door during early production.",

Far off in the distance, we can see new ideas taking shape, but it’s often anyone’s guess how long it will be before they’re ready for prime time.

The change builds on last year’s move to give every secondary calendar a dedicated owner. The rollout starts today for personal accounts and on January 27 for Workspace users. It’s pretty easy to create a secondary calendar in Google Calendar and then completely forget about it, but Google is stepping in to tidy things up. The company is rolling out a change that ensures any secondary calendars you own will always appear in your calendar list in Settings, making them easier to find and manage. Detailed in a Google Workspace Update , this move builds on a change Google introduced late last year, when it moved secondary calendars to a dedicated ownership model. Under that system, every secondary calendar has a single owner who’s responsible for its settings, permissions, and lifecycle. The new update closes a practical gap in that setup by ensuring ownership is visible.",

We’re collecting feedback from testers to try and see just how widespread the issue may be. Last fall, Google scored a major win in its ongoing efforts to break down the walls between Android and iOS users, bringing iPhone-compatible Quick Share to Pixel 10 phones . That was a fantastic start, but there was still a long way to go in terms of expanding compatibility. Earlier this month we saw Google’s efforts begin to bring the upgrade to Pixel 9 phones in Android Canary , and that’s work the company has continued with its more recent Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 release. But as more users give QPR3 Beta 2 a try, we’re discovering some unexpected Quick Share problems. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Code for these changes is present in the Galaxy Ring Manager app, but we’re not sure when to expect the changes to go live. Samsung’s Galaxy Ring uses notifications on your phone to keep you up to speed about its battery and connectivity — for example, alerts when battery charge gets down to 15 percent or when connection with the ring has been lost. Today, we’ve seen evidence that those notifications will soon be a little smarter, ideally helping users avoid missing out on tracked health data.

Pricing has yet to be revealed, but this is billed as a premium ‘endgame’ handheld. AYANEO held its first product sharing session of the year this morning, and it finally gave us a look at one of the most anticipated small gaming handhelds this year. The Pocket S Mini, which was first teased in September 2025, brings the ultra-premium all-metal design of the Pocket S series down to a size that actually fits in your pocket. The Pocket S Mini has a retro-friendly 4:3 display, although the exact specifications and size have yet to be announced. On stream, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang held the device next to a standard smartphone, and it roughly matched in size. The screen itself is around the same size as the budget Pocket AIR Mini’s 4.2-inch LCD display, although this handheld is much, much more powerful.",

Meanwhile, Samsung appears to be releasing only minor upgrades for its upcoming Galaxy S26 series, as rivals significantly innovate — raising concerns about its competitiveness. Samsung is gearing up to launch a barely upgraded Galaxy S26 series in the coming weeks, hoping to take on the iPhone 17 series with renewed vigor. While Samsung mostly stagnates even on its Plus and Ultra flagships and might do so for yet another generation, Apple is preparing for another big change with the iPhone 18 Pro series and is finally entering the foldable market with the iPhone Fold , likely in September. Now, specs for all these upcoming iPhones have leaked again, and it’s not looking great for Samsung unless it pulls up its socks. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It could finally bring the camera on par with other flagships, especially by including a 200MP primary sensor. However, it’s unclear whether this is for the OnePlus 16 or any other phone. OnePlus’ parent company, OPPO, has recently made significant strides with its flagship Find X series cameras, from using a large 200MP telephoto sensor to supporting external zoom lenses on the phone . Unfortunately, OnePlus has been deprived of these features, with the camera especially sidelined to improve performance in the latest OnePlus 15 and 15R phones. This, naturally, has drawn much criticism, which OnePlus now appears to be preparing to tackle with the next flagship — most likely, the OnePlus 16. While the launch of that supposed phone is still several months away, we’re already seeing early leaks, starting with speculation about the camera. Last month, leaker Digital Chat Station predicted that OnePlus’ next flagship would feature an upgraded 200MP primary camera. Now, another leaker, Yogesh Brar , is highlighting details about the other sensors in the phone’s camera setup…",

Instead of copying the entire message and then booting the extra text, Google Messages may soon let you just copy the link directly. Google is also working on letting you edit Smart Replies before sending them. Google Messages already gives you a bit of an advantage when handling links. For instance, it generates previews for URLs embedded in received messages. However, when it comes to copying those links, it forces you to copy the entire message and then clip out the link manually. This, as you would guess, is inconvenient, but Google could soon bring a fix. Along with this fix, Google could be working to improve how you send Smart Replies.

Google Wallet integration could enable the AI to display live status updates for trains, flights, and events, making Magic Cue far more proactive. Google Tasks integration could make event reminders clearer by allowing direct access outside of Calendar. Magic Cue was one of Pixel 10’s highlight features, but it fell pretty flat at launch . Eventually, Google redeemed itself as Magic Cue improved , and while it may not be a groundbreaking new feature, it certainly has a place within the Pixel ecosystem.

    "body": "TL;DR Last year, Google announced that developers would have to register even when users are only sideloading their apps. Eventually, Google backed down and offered to give advanced users an option for manual installs from unknown sources. Ahead of that rolling out, we’re seeing Google Play begin to prepare for this system’s arrival. Update: January 18, 2026 (11:18 PM ET): After publication, we heard from Marc Prud’hommeaux, the founder of the App Fair Project and an F-Droid board member, who pointed out that the warning strings we referenced are not entirely new to Android. Versions of this language have existed in Android’s system-level Package Installer since at least July 2025. This suggests that Google has been preparing the developer verification flow mentioned below for quite some time. That said, our reporting focused on the fact that this language has now appeared inside the Google Play app itself, which is a new development. The move from system-level code to Google Play could signal that the company is actively preparing to surface this flow to users. Still, Google has yet to clearly explain how its promised “advanced” sideloading path will work in practice. Until the c…",

It wasn’t going to ditch a popular feature, so the most likely reason is that not many people are using it anymore. This speculation is based on reporting from Janko Roettgers of Lowpass , published via The Verge , who suggests declining usage might be behind the move.

Despite their new names, the chipsets repackage designs from previous generations with minimal upgrades. The move appears inspired by Qualcomm’s recent launch of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. Over the years, MediaTek’s flagship Dimensity chips have improved enough to put up a tough fight against Qualcomm’s Elite mobile chips. The latest Dimensity 9500 proved to be too close to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in our testing. Now, just a few months after its release, MediaTek is launching a slightly less powerful variant, the Dimensity 9500s, likely geared towards affordable flagships. Along with it, MediaTek has also launched the Dimensity 8500, which might be geared towards the upper mid-range. Dimensity 9500 The Dimensity 9500s is built on TSMC’s N3E 3nm process, the same as the 9500, and maintains the same CPU architecture with “all big cores.” But instead of deploying Arm’s flagship and the newest C1 cores, the Dimensity 9500s uses older Cortex-X925 at 3.73GHz for the prime core, complemented by three Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Arm Cortex-A720 cores at undisclosed clock speeds.

In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority Another CES , another step closer to the future that Black Mirror warned us about. This year, that moment came courtesy of Razer and its latest experiment in AI companionship, Project Ava. It’s an AI-powered gaming assistant designed to sit on your desk, analyze what’s happening on-screen, and offer real-time advice. It also seems to want to be a bit more than that at times, so we decided to poll you about how you feel about it. We’ve already made our feelings clear on the subject after our own Joe Maring spent some hands-on time with Project Ava at CES 2026. While he found parts of the tech genuinely interesting, like its ability to quickly scan game menus and suggest loadouts, the overall experience left him more creeped out than impressed. The giggling, the attempts at playful banter, and the clear push toward forming a “bond” with the AI overshadowed the more practical gaming-assistant side of the device. But it’s your opinion we care most about, so we put a poll in Joe’s article asking if you’d consider buying Project Ava.",

    "summary": "Latest iOS beta takes an important step toward Android and iPhone end-to-end encrypted RCS messages.",
    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Apple is working on end-to-end encryption for RCS in iOS 26.3 Beta 2. The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.
