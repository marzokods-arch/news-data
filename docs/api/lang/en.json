Google still has a long way to go to get its premier in-car phone mirroring product to that pinnacle. To be fair to Google, recent updates have addressed some of its user base’s biggest annoyances.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google is extending the timeline for Google Duo’s demise by a few months. The previously set deadline of September 2025 for removing all Duo features has now been moved to January 2026. When that happens, all users will be automatically migrated to Meet, and any older history will be removed. In 2022, Google merged its then-popular video calling app Duo into Meet , which, at the time, was limited to video calling for Workspace accounts. Anyone familiar with Google wouldn’t be surprised by this gesture — or by the period of confusion that follows, during which multiple apps with similar use cases continue to exist. So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026. We recently witnessed the updated timeline in a warning message shown at the top of the Google Meet app on Android. The support page still displays the older …",

This is because the Exynos 2500 suffered some rather notable issues. First, production yield issues and delays meant Samsung had to skip the chip entirely for the Galaxy S25 series . When it finally arrived in the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the performance was pretty lackluster; in CPU performance, it was no faster than last year’s Snapdragon rival, and there were only marginal gains in graphics.",

I ended up with several of these portable batteries to test out, and while I do appreciate their convenience, one thing stood out in all of my tests: You should really be wary of the battery’s capacity. 10,000mAh won’t be enough to charge your ~5,000mAh Pixel 10, 10 Pro, or 10 Pro XL more than once.",

    "summary": "Android almost had its own IRS that would audit apps for their battery usage. Here’s how it would’ve worked.",
    "body": "There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Google restricting background work. With every new Android release, Google seemingly further restricts what apps running in the background can do. This is understandable because battery power is a finite commodity on Android phones , so allowing apps to do whatever they want whenever they want would be detrimental to battery life. To prevent rogue applications from draining your phone’s battery , the Android OS implements a number of battery management tactics to control when apps can run and how long they can run. Apps that need to perform critical, real-time tasks like downloading a file, tracking a run, or playing music can create a foreground service, but in order to do so, they must show a notification so users are aware. Instead of creating a foreground service, Google recommends most developers use APIs like JobScheduler and AlarmManager (or a higher-level wrapper, like WorkManager) to queue tasks in the background.",

While it did manage to add more than 40,000 new subscribers this quarter, those gains came entirely from its prepaid and business divisions. Its postpaid phone service actually lost 7,000 subscribers during this period. With T-Mobile edging ever closer to surpassing Verizon’s total subscriber count, it’s clear big changes are needed if Verizon wants to turn this ship around. Verizon’s new CEO, Dan Schulman, insists the company is working hard to do just that, and that it will “no longer be the hunting ground for competitors looking to gain share”.",

My time with the early Pixels was plagued with defective phones and issues I’d grown tired of. My Pixel XL, 2 XL, and 3 XL all had to be swapped on warranty at least three times, and the Pixel 3 XL made things worse by being a frustrating device even when it was working as intended.",

But in 2025, acquiescence is the name of the game, and rather than bracing for another four years of conflict, they’ve instead been kissing the ring. A few weeks back, that extended to YouTube performing a massive about-face on the necessary steps it had taken to ban some of the worst voices on its platform , spreading lies, hate, and disinformation — instead opening the door to restore their access.

That process can be wildly complex, as in the case of generative video — but on the simpler end of the spectrum, AI can be very helpful for parsing large bodies of text to create concise summaries. Google’s started putting its AI to work in the latter way on the Play Store, where you’ll soon see AI-generated summaries of aggregated user app reviews.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority Protecting our expensive new smartphone is a top priority for many of us, and online marketplaces are flooded with options, from cases to display protection . An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

This enables richer, glanceable experiences, with Google Maps expected to be one of the first apps to use it for low-power navigation. The feature uses the same ultra-low-power display state as AOD to save battery and will likely be introduced as a new developer API in Android 17. Most Android phones have an optional feature called always-on display (AOD) that, as its name implies, keeps your phone’s screen on at all times. This feature is handy because it lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance, though it does drain some extra battery. While Android’s new Live Updates feature lets you see more from certain notifications on the AOD, they can only show so much, forcing you to pick up your phone to get the full picture. To solve this problem, Google is working on a major evolution of the AOD in Android 17 that could allow apps to fully integrate with it.

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority While there’s been a modest revival in dedicated audio players, most listeners — including many discerning audiophiles — are streaming music straight from their smartphones. And why not? Android devices offer a vast selection of music streaming platforms , surprisingly capable speakers, and some of the best Bluetooth connectivity around. Still, Android’s audio signal chain remains a bit of a black box. What actually happens to your music between the app and your headphone driver is often unclear. To lift the veil, here’s how Android handles your audio — and what you can do to get the best possible sound.",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Google has confirmed it is bringing Sheets support to NotebookLM “very soon.” This complements Docs and Slides support in NotebookLM. Sheets support is currently limited to NotebookLM Plus users, i.e., those who subscribe to Google’s AI Plus or AI Pro plans. NotebookLM is easily one of Google’s most highly cherished AI tools , with fewer haters than any other of Google’s apps. It lets you research and process data from numerous different sources and convert verbose formats into digestible chunks, or even AI-generated podcasts and video essays. With an upcoming update, Google is set to improve file support for free users. Google Drive integration already lets you import files from Docs and Slides as sources to NotebookLM. But the research tool lacks support for Google Sheets (or .XLS and .XLSX files) in the free tier. Thankfully, if you’ve been yearning for the option to import your Sheets or Excel files to NotebookLM, Google may be bringing it to you soon.",
