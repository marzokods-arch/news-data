    "body": "From having the country “talm ‘bout innit” to getting name-checked on “Whim Whammie,” one of the year’s buzziest breakthrough rap hits, BunnaB, 22, has emerged as one of the most resonant voices in a new class of Atlanta-bred female rappers. Blending the raucous debauchery of mixtape-era Gucci Mane and the Futuristic Era sounds that dominated their childhoods, this new class of female MCs prioritizes party music that speaks to the specific realities and intricacies of female relationships in the social media-stained 2020s. For her part, BunnaB, beloved for her infectious, near-constant laughs, has separated herself from this ascendant pack by infusing her bubbly disposition, girl’s girl attitude, unfettered authenticity — and the unmistakable gravity of earning a second shot.

    "body": "“Nice guys finish last.” Baseball manager Leo Durocher first said a version of that now-legendary phrase in 1946, and nearly 80 years later, bending, breaking and ignoring the rules is commonplace in public life. Deceit is so mainstream that a number of merchandisers have developed “Make Lying Wrong Again” ballcaps and T-shirts. But Drew Baldridge counters the idea that nice guys are losers. He went all the way to No.&nbsp;3 on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart in 2024 with “She’s Somebody’s Daughter (Reimagined),” a song with a protective veneer that he released on his own Patoka Sounds label. Follow-up “Tough People,” an affirmation of regular Joe resilience, peaked at No.&nbsp;13 in June 2025. His latest single — “Rebel,” which Stoney Creek released to country radio via PlayMPE on Oct.&nbsp;30 — takes on the good-guy stereotype, imbuing it with notable power. “Sometimes in our society, the wrong things get glorified,” Baldridge notes. “It’s hard sometimes when you’re trying to stand up for good things and you see [the] wrong things get glorified.” Around March 2024, he reached out to one of his “Tough People” co-writers — fellow artist Adam Sanders, currently a competitor on th…",

    "body": "David Israelite’s guest column on October 23, 2025 explained how little music creators get paid across different streaming services. I just want to lay out the facts and be clear: YouTube pays the least for music, full stop. They always have and always will unless someone stands up to them. They’ll throw up smoke screens and tempt you to look the other way, but let’s not be fooled. YouTube recently touted that it paid artists $8 billion over the past year. This sounds impressive, but it’s not. During the same period, Spotify generated roughly $18 billion in revenue and paid about $12 billion to music rights holders — nearly 67% of its revenue. By contrast, YouTube generated $60 billion in revenue and paid only $8 billion to rights holders — about 13%. YouTube will say they’re not just a music service. But I would argue that YouTube never would have become such a successful platform without music, and even if only one-third of their revenue comes from music (and it’s likely higher), they certainly should be paying more than Spotify, not 50% less.

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",
