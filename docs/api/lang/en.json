CEOs are touting their companies’ ability to rapidly spool up satellite, sensor, and rocket production. Publicly, they all agree with the assertion of Pentagon officials that US industry already possesses the technologies required to make a homeland missile defense system work. The challenge, they say, is tying all of it together under the umbrella of a sophisticated command and control network. Sensors must be able to detect and track missile threats, and that information must rapidly get to weapons that can shoot them down. Gen. Chance Saltzman, the Space Force’s top commander, likes to call Golden Dome a “systems of systems.” Read full article Comments",

    "body": "On Tuesday, OpenAI announced Atlas , a new web browser with ChatGPT integration, to let you “chat with a page,” as the company puts it. But Atlas also goes beyond the usual LLM back-and-forth with Agent Mode, a “preview mode” feature the company says can “get work done for you” by clicking, scrolling, and reading through various tabs. “Agentic” AI is far from new, of course; OpenAI itself rolled out a preview of the web browsing Operator agent in January and introduced the more generalized “ChatGPT agent” in July . Still, prominently featuring this capability in a major product release like this—even in “preview mode”—signals a clear push to get this kind of system in front of end users. I wanted to put Atlas’ Agent Mode through its paces to see if it could really save me time in doing the kinds of tedious online tasks I plod through every day. In each case, I’ll outline a web-based problem, lay out the Agent Mode prompt I devised to try to solve it, and describe the results. My final evaluation will rank each task on a 10-point scale, with 10 being “did exactly what I wanted with no problems” and one being “complete failure.” Read full article Comments",

Separately, makers of the Domain Name System resolver software Unbound warned of similar vulnerabilities that were reported by the same researchers. The unbound vulnerability severity score is 5.6 Revisiting Kaminsky’s cache poisoning attack The vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause DNS resolvers located inside thousands of organizations to replace valid results for domain lookups with corrupted ones. The corrupted results would replace the IP addresses controlled by the domain name operator (for instance, 3.15.119.63 for arstechnica.com) with malicious ones controlled by the attacker.

    "body": "Tesla reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2025 this afternoon. Earlier this month , we learned that the electric vehicle manufacturer had a pretty good Q3 in terms of sales, which grew by 7.3 percent year over year and cleared out tens of thousands of cars from inventory in the process. However, that hasn’t translated into greater profitability. Even though revenues grew by 12 percent to $28 billion compared to the same period last year , Tesla’s operating expenses grew by 50 percent. As a result, its operating margin halved to just 5.8 percent. And so its profit for the quarter fell by 37 percent to $1.4 billion. Some growth in revenue came from its battery and solar division; this increased by 44 percent to $3.4 billion compared to Q3 2024. Services—including the Supercharger network, which is now open to an increasing number of other makes of EV—also grew, increasing by 25 percent to $3.4 billion. EV deliveries increased by 7 percent to 497,099, most of which were the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover. Automotive revenues grew slightly less, increasing 6 percent year over year to $21.2 billion. Read full article Comments",

The most significant new announcement is that Cadillac will offer an Escalade IQ with a so-called “Level 3” conditional automated driving system in 2028. GM is referring to it as a “hands off, eyes off” system and says it will integrate advanced digital mapping, use of lidar and other systems, and advanced machine learning to handle the driving duties in a controlled environment up to 80 mph (129 km/h). This means you can theoretically watch a movie from the driver’s seat while your car takes you down the highway to the airport. Over time, the system’s operation areas will expand to cover even more roads, making driving unnecessary in many situations—unless, of course, you like to drive. Read full article Comments",

So far, much of the attention has been on the stratospheric prices that Americans might see on plans they buy from Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Critical tax credits for those plans are set to expire at the end of the year, and, on top of that, insurers have proposed a median 18 percent price increase for 2026. With the higher prices and a loss of credits, some Americans could see their monthly premiums more than double. In an analysis last month, nonpartisan health policy group KFF estimated that, on average, ACA marketplace premiums would rise 114 percent, going from $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026.

They hoped that the Sufi philosopher, famed for his acerbic wisdom, could mediate a dispute that had driven a wedge between them. Nasreddin listened patiently to the first villager’s version of the story and, upon its conclusion, exclaimed, “You are absolutely right!” The second villager then presented his case. After hearing him out, Nasreddin again responded, “You are absolutely right!” An observant bystander, confused by Nasreddin’s proclamations, interjected, “But Mullah, they can’t both be right.” Nasreddin paused, regarding the bystander for a moment before replying, “You are absolutely right, too!” In late May, the White House’s first “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) report was criticized for citing multiple research studies that did not exist. Fabricated citations like these are common in the outputs of generative artificial intelligence based on large language models, or LLMs. LLMs have presented plausible-sounding sources, catchy titles, or even false data to craft their conclusions.

In Myanmar, for example, SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected ‘scam centers.'” Starlink is not licensed to operate in Myanmar. While Dreyer didn’t say how the terminals were disabled, it’s known that Starlink can disable individual terminals based on their ID numbers or use geofencing to block areas from receiving signals.

Google’s first two attempts at making Android fit for your face didn’t work out, but the AI era and a partnership with Samsung have enabled a third attempt, and maybe the third time’s the charm. Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy XR headset , the first and currently only device running Google’s new Android XR platform . It’s available for pre-order today, but it will not come cheap. The headset, which doesn’t come with controllers, retails for $1,800. Galaxy XR is a fully enclosed headset with passthrough video. It looks similar to the Apple Vision Pro, right down to the battery pack at the end of a cable. It packs solid hardware, including 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 processor. That’s a slightly newer version of the chip powering Meta’s Quest 3 headset , featuring six CPU cores and an Adreno GPU that supports up to dual 4.3K displays. The new headset has a pair of 3,552 x 3,840 Micro-OLED displays with a 109-degree field of view. That’s marginally more pixels than the Vision Pro and almost three times as many as the Quest 3. The displays can refresh at up to 90Hz, but the default is 72Hz to save power.…",

    "body": "A few years back, Google made waves when it claimed that some of its hardware had achieved quantum supremacy , performing operations that would be effectively impossible to simulate on a classical computer. That claim didn’t hold up especially well, as mathematicians later developed methods to help classical computers catch up , leading the company to repeat the work on an improved processor. While this back-and-forth was unfolding, the field became less focused on quantum supremacy and more on two additional measures of success. The first is quantum utility, in which a quantum computer performs computations that are useful in some practical way. The second is quantum advantage, in which a quantum system completes calculations in a fraction of the time it would take a typical computer. (IBM and a startup called Pasqual have published a useful discussion about what would be required to verifiably demonstrate a quantum advantage.) Today, Google and a large collection of academic collaborators are publishing a paper describing a computational approach that demonstrates a quantum advantage compared to current algorithms—and may actually help us achieve something useful.

    "body": "Amid the chaos of the Trump administration’s haphazard job cuts and a mass exodus of leadership, the Food and Drug Administration is experiencing a slowdown of drug reviews and approvals, according to an analysis reported by Stat News . An assessment of metrics by RBC Capital Markets analysts found that FDA drug approvals dropped 14 percentage points in the third quarter compared to the average of the six previous quarters—falling from an average of 87 percent to 73 percent this past quarter. In line with that finding, analysts noted that the delay rate in meeting deadlines for drug application reviews rose from an average of 4 percent to 11 percent. The FDA also rejected more applications than normal, going from a historical average of 10 percent to 15 percent in the third quarter. A growing number of rejections relate to problems at manufacturing plants, which in turn could suggest problems with the FDA’s inspection and auditing processes. Read full article Comments",

Another enjoyable offering was a 2022 monster movie called Troll , essentially a Norwegian take on the classic Godzilla formula. Netflix just dropped a trailer for the sequel, Troll 2, which looks to be very much in the same vein as its predecessor. (Spoilers for the first Troll movie below.) Don’t confuse the Netflix franchise with 2010’s Trollhunter , shot in the style of a found footage mockumentary. A group of college students sets off into the wilds of the fjordland to make a documentary about a suspected bear poacher named Hans. They discover that Hans is actually hunting down trolls and decide to document those endeavors instead, but soon realize they are very much out of their depth. Read full article Comments",

The upcoming 26.1 update for all of those OSes is taking a step toward addressing some of the complaints, though not by changing things about the default look of Liquid Glass. Rather, the update is adding a new toggle that will let users choose between a Clear and Tinted look for Liquid Glass, with Clear representing the default look and Tinted cranking up the opacity and contrast. The default glassy look of the notifications in iOS 26. The Tinted toggle fogs up the glass, preserving a hint of translucency.
