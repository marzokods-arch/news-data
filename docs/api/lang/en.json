While pricing is not yet available, the app promises savings over separate subscriptions. Users will have to manually cancel their existing subscriptions first if signed up through third parties. Update, October 16, 2025 (12:11 PM ET): We saw this one coming a couple weeks ago, and today Apple and NBCUniversal are making the bundle official: Starting October 20, you’ll be able to subscribe to both Apple TV and Peacock Premium for just about $15 a month, or Apple TV and Peacock Premium Plus for $20. Original article, October 3, 2025 (11:04 AM ET): You’d be forgiven for wincing a little anytime you see the name of one of your favorite streaming services pop in a news feed, as how often is it good news? If it’s not upcoming shows being shelved over fears of upsetting just the worst people, it’s news of price hike after price hike driving up your monthly bills. Today we’d love to break from that pattern with some actual good news — even if we don’t quite have all the salient details just yet.",

Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

Shockingly, mere five months after its launch, reports suggest that Samsung has killed the Edge line . That means no further production of the Galaxy S25 Edge beyond existing stock, and no plans to launch its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge. One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August. Even the lowest-selling S25 Plus sold many times more than the Edge, but with the advantage of having launched earlier in the year.",

Live Updates allow apps to provide persistent progress updates in the status bar, on the always-on display, and at the top of the notification panel. The feature wasn’t fully ready in Android 16’s initial release, which is why the Easter egg is only now being updated to support it. One of the biggest new features in Android 16 is Live Updates. Live Updates are basically Android’s version of iOS’ Live Activities, and they allow you to quickly get progress updates from applications without stopping whatever you’re doing. For example, a navigation app could use Live Updates to show your next turn in a status bar chip, or a food delivery app could use it to tell you that your food is about to be dropped off. There’s a lot of potential ways that apps can use the Live Updates feature, but unfortunately, developers had to wait a bit to actually use it. That’s because the Live Updates feature wasn’t ready until last month’s Android 16 QPR1 release , which added full support for it.

For his part, he admitted his loyalty to Google Home had finally run out. He explained how years of reliability issues and patchy updates had worn him down, and how learning that Gemini for Home won’t launch in India anytime soon was the final straw.

T-Mobile has announced that that plan is going away in a few weeks, but it’s offering subscribers a pretty decent consolation.

    "body": "TL;DR Motorola has unveiled the Moto X70 Air, a super-slim smartphone with a thickness of 5.99 mm, powered by the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip. It features a 4,800 mAh battery with 68W wired and 15W wireless charging support. The phone launches in China first, with a global debut expected soon as the Motorola Edge 70. The race to build ultra-thin smartphones is heating up, with brands like Samsung and Apple already pushing the limits through the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air . Now, Motorola has joined the fight with its latest contender: the Moto X70 Air. Officially unveiled in China just weeks after its first teaser, the X70 Air is one of the slimmest phones the company has ever produced. At only 5.99mm thick and weighing about 159g, it blends style with substance, packing a 4,800mAh battery, Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip, and triple 50MP cameras into a chassis thinner than most flagships. Although pricing has not been announced, the phone is already listed on Lenovo’s official website , with a global debut expected under the “Motorola Edge 70” name.

    "body": "TL;DR A future update for Google TV may let you program the customizable remote button to open a specific smart home camera feed directly. This would add a new shortcut option to the ‘star’ button, which can currently be set to launch an app, the input switcher, or the full smart home panel. Evidence for this unreleased feature was discovered in the code of the Google TV Ambient Mode app, though it’s not yet live. When you’re relaxing at home watching a show on your Google TV , interruptions are the last thing you want. Still, a package delivery or a strange sound outside can pull your attention away. That’s why the customizable button on select Google TV remotes is so useful, as it can be configured to open the smart home panel , letting you view a camera feed or control other devices. A future update, however, may take this a step further by letting you bypass the panel to launch your preferred camera feed directly. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
