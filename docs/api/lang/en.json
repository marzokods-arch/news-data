If the last episode of Fallout Season 2 left you hoping for a knockdown, dragout fight with a deathclaw, I've got some bad news for you. After not one, not two, but three deathclaws make a dramatic entrance on the New Vegas strip, Lucy and The Ghoul make a wise but fairly unexciting decision, and one we've all made when encountering a big monster in a game: they just sprint past them and load into a new map. Despite the lack of a battle, it is nice to see typically too-cool-for-school Ghoul absolutely terrified, and we know why: he was maybe the first person to ever see a deathclaw in the wild in Alaska, and even after 200 years they still make his irradiated blood run cold. It's not a great sign for New Vegas that deathclaws have moved into the Strip, though on the other side of the fence at least Freeside is looking busier and more bustling than it ever has. Those deathclaws are now between The Ghoul and Hank MacLean, who's holed up in the secret management Vault-Tec vault The Ghoul has never managed to find—the one he believes contains his missing wife and daughter.

Any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles is strictly prohibited in accordance with our existing policies prohibiting impersonation and intellectual property infringement. The announcement comes after a surge in awful AI-generated music acts last year. The most infamous was probably The Velvet Sundown : at its peak the non-existent psych-rock four-piece was attracting 500,000 monthly listeners, but now generally only attracts around 160,000. Mind you, that is still a heck of a lot, especially for music so bland it sounds unmistakably like AI (though the same could have been said for Wolfmother in 2005, had generative AI existed back then).

    "body": "Warhammer company Games Workshop says that it does not allow generative AI in its products, and although some of its senior managers have investigated the technology, \"none are that excited about it yet.\" The comments came from Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree in the company's half-yearly financial report for the back end of 2025, in which it declared revenue of £332.1m ($445.9m USD), up from £299.5m ($402.1m USD) in 2024. Rountree goes on to explain GW's \"very cautious\" internal policy on AI, which is that \"we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions.\" Those'll be the Golden Demon painting competitions, which banned AI in 2024 after one of the previous year's winners was found to have used AI-generated art created by Midjourney in a printed backdrop behind the miniature. While Rountree does say the company is \"allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology\", this still comes off as an explicitly anti-AI stance.

    "body": "It's pretty incredible that Hytale launched into early access today. It's a miracle it even exists at all, really: games canceled by major studios typically vanish forever. Remember Blizzard's survival game Odyssey that was canceled after nearly eight years in development? Poof. Gone, tragically leaving behind nothing more than a handful of leaked screenshots. So it's genuinely great news that Hytale, which was cancelled last summer by Riot, beat the odds and had what sounds like a massive launch today , with preorders securing enough funds to support several more years of development . No matter what, that's a remarkable achievement for a game that was all but dead and buried just a few months ago. And after spending some time today in Hytale today, I can already see the years of work that went into it. I can also see, as the devs warned us before launch, that it's got a long way to go. Back in November, Hypixel Studios CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme said the adventure sandbox ' isn't good yet ', but it already feels pretty good to me.

I found a hefty deposit early on, and I've smelted it all down into iron ingots for making fancy weaponry and armor. If you're in the same boat, don't worry—I'll set you on the easier path to survival with a quick rundown on how to get iron in Hytale , including what you'll need to mine deposits and process your ore haul. Where to find iron in Hytale Look along cave walls for small deposits of iron. (Image credit: Hypixel Studios) You can find iron in Hytale by exploring underground caves in any of the Emerald Grove biomes. I found plenty of iron deposits close to the entrance of a few deep tunnels near where I spawned in the grassy meadows. It also seems like the deeper you go into the caves, the more iron you'll find, but be prepared for tougher cave-dwelling monsters and pitch-black darkness. It's also pretty easy to get lost, so take extra care if you're still in the early game. I've died to just as many spiders as bears thanks to \"just one more node\" greed.

Windows 8 was all about big, square icons designed for a new wave of touchscreen-enabled laptops and Windows phones. The classic desktop designed for mouse and keyboard was gone, based on a prediction that soon everyone would want to use all their devices in the same way (this has still not come to pass). At the same time Microsoft's UI designers performed an all-time beefing-it maneuver, its business geniuses rolled out a new Apple-inspired Microsoft Store and method of locking down apps that spurred Valve's Gabe Newell to declare \"Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space\" and start investing into Linux development. It was truly the nadir of Windows' 40 year history—and is now proof that there's an audience for literally everything, because someone has made a Windows 8 desktop environment for Linux. It's so damn nuts I'm actually tempted to try it. The description for Win8DE on Github is almost poetic. \"If you are one of who enjoyed the windows 8 and mi…",

I've played more than my fair share of cozy life sims, managing everything from farms to convenience stores, but a caravan was a new one that I'd been itching to try. Cozy Caravan launched into early access on Steam last year and just rolled out its 1.0 update this month. It's not the deepest life sim by a long shot, but it's cute and approachable. The rest of my thoughts are down below, but here's a quick pros and 'less pros' chart: ✅ My favorite parts ⚠️ Take note though Adorable animations and chillstep-y tunes Recommends playing with controller Lots of little cooking minigames Stop motion animation can be disabled if it makes you sick Real time market day selling No money management Cute collectathon fetch quests NPC dialogue can be very repetitive (Image credit: 5 Lives Studio) There are four main activities that occupy my time in Cozy Caravan: driving between poi…",

We are, eternally, yearning to play with blocks. For Hytale, that yearning seems to have paid off. After going live earlier today, Hytale is at time of writing the most watched game on Twitch by far, attracting over 420,000 viewers across thousands of streams. (Image credit: Twitch) A cursory survey of those launch streams seems to indicate that many day one players are being brutally savaged by the bears roaming Hytale's forests, which—if you're wondering—matches the early experiences of PC Gamer staff.

That's why I felt a twinge of scepticism in me today when I spotted this report from IGN pointing out players on the Arc Raiders subreddit found you can magically get better aim by cranking up your fps. But I've tested it, and it's true. This saga all started when a viewer of streamer Nickmercs noticed Nick's aim snapped onto Arcs (the bots in the game) as he was shooting. Nick uses a controller, which is key to the whole affair. After some took to accusing the previous Faze member of cheating , others discovered that the aim assist for controller players appears to be stronger in Arc Raiders, the higher your fps is. With the PC Gamer RTX 5070 Ti rig, I set everything to low, dynamic lighting to static, and resolution to 1080p and managed to get up to 300 fps without frame generation. It's possible to cap the frame rate in the game's settings, so I have all I need to test this theory out. I discovered that Reddit is actually right about this one. Shock horror, I know. At 300 fps, I discovered a few quirks when it co…",

Nick has been going to town testing DLSS 4.5 since the Nvidia App beta released, running presets across different games and across both an RTX 5090 and an RTX 3060 Ti , just to see how hefty the performance difference is between the GPU generations. While editing his article I've been scrubbing through the video benchmarks on the page, and while you're not always seeing a huge performance difference in terms of frame rates, you're often seeing a big delta between the power draw of the two DLSS models.

But the impact of the buyout was incommensurate with its cost. For years, GOG has marketed itself as the videogame storefront with values: preserving games, keeping them DRM-free, and letting you actually own them. But values have a tendency to fall by the wayside in the tumult of a corporate sale. Players were concerned. But perhaps there's comfort to be taken from the fact that GOG's new boss is, quite literally, the same as the old boss. The store was acquired by Michał Kiciński, its original co-founder, under the explicit banner of preserving its integrity and mission statement. (Image credit: GOG) \"I think it has a very solid foundation as a company,\" Kiciński tells PC Gamer. \"Good results, a very good brand—known, respected—with very clear values, and customers love it and stand behind it.\" Plus, Kiciński has a sentimental attachment: \"The less business[-y] reasons [for buying GOG] were: I'm kind of a parent of the company.

So rather than another day of doom and gloom talking about the rise of AI and the memorypocalypse , let's look at some positives. Probably the most important area we saw really exciting developments in was OLED monitors. One of the biggest problems with these that has probably stopped a lot of people from taking the plunge and buying one—alongside high price tags and worries about burn-in—is text fringing. OLED panels look fantastic for gaming, but for other things, they haven't always been the best choice, because small, thin, and wriggly little shapes such as letters (the most common little digital wrigglers) have tended to look a little fuzzy when displayed on an OLED panel. That's because of the way OLED displays its pixels. As a refresher, there are two main types of OLED panels: QD-OLED, from Samsung, and WOLED, from LG.

A game that only needed my space bar to utterly challenge my musical timing and tug on my heartstring through six acts replete with stunning visual presentation and interwoven stories that see even the most minor characters have their moment in the spotlight. You would think that a rhythm game relying on just one button would saddle developer 7th Beat Games with a painfully limited scope. I'd argue that's a little true in the earlier levels of Rhythm Doctor—where the game is doing its best to help you get to grips with different beats and timing. But even in the moments where the game is still busy establishing its foundational gameplay, it's done with such pizzazz and care for every character and setting involved.

The next Helldivers 2 warbond, however, offers a more subtle alternative to Super Earth's standard ballistic bombast. Called Redacted Regiment , the warbond is stuffed with suppressed weaponry and diversionary deployables for Helldivers who've been hoping since launch for a better stealth mission toolkit. Kept you waiting, huh? The warbond's main attractions are its silenced primary weapons. The R-72 Censor is a semi-auto precision rifle with an integrated suppressor for taking out enemies undetected at long range. For quietly clearing an area at closer quarters, there's also the AR-59 Suppressor, a silenced full-auto assault rifle. Technically speaking, the Redacted Regiment weapons won't be Helldivers 2's first suppressed primaries: That honor goes to the M7S SMG that was added with the ODST crossover warbond. But these two guns will likely offer more mainstay usability than their submachine gun cousin—though I'd still expect some amount of tradeoff in armor penetration or ammo count to keep them from being the only choice.…",

But that's okay, because as it so happens, they're both actually pretty good. Well, in the case of the new DLSS 4.5, it's mostly good. With version 4.5, Nvidia has introduced three new elements to its AI-powered suite of rendering technologies: a second generation transformer neural network for DLSS Super Resolution (aka upscaling), dynamic Multi Frame Generation (MFG), and a 6x mode. However, only the first one is available to use right now, as the new frame gen stuff won't make an appearance until spring. How to use DLSS 4.5 in games In order to force games to use the new upscaler, you'll need to use the 591.74 GeForce Game Ready drivers , plus the latest beta version of the Nvidia app (though a full release may be released by the time you're reading this). To get that, click on the Settings option in the Nvidia app, then select About, and finally check the option to opt into betas.

I'd like to see how far we can push the diversity of companions and their stories even farther.\" In this way, all of Baldur's Gate 3's companions have a similar story for ending up where they are, and even those with a rich history in the region are still somewhat lost for one reason or another, like Wyll. \"The…",

You've got to admit, it's interesting to observe the aftermath of a round, finding corpses, dead Arcs, and just generally picking the bones. It can be surprisingly lucrative on occasion, but it's a real pain if you have any definite plans for a round or need to find specific items, which the game increasingly requires us to do with Expeditions, quests, and events. Having to get Ion Sputters and Frequency Modulation Boxes, resources unique to Stella Montis, for the new Expedition this time around has really brought home just how annoying late spawns are—if the Snap and Salvage quest hadn't already made the point. After all, even if you're just a few minutes late to Stella Montis, your chances of getting what you need are incredibly small, and that's not even taking into account the RNG of where you spawn.

Allowing players to \"design and publish\" their own missions within GTA Online, creators can set and tweak objectives, characters and mechanics to create their own scenarios, and then share them with the wider playerbase. An omnipresent hazard with community creation tools is content created in bad taste, and soon enough Rockstar had an absolute all-timer on its hands. One player used the tools to put together a mission called \"We are Charlie Kirk\", in which players recreate the assassination of the rightwing political commentator and content creator Charlie Kirk. Kirk was making a public appearance at Utah Valley University in September last year when he was shot and killed. His alleged killer is in custody and awaiting trial, with prosecutors intending to seek the death penalty. To briefly explain the GTA Online mission: the player spawns on a roof overlooking a crowd and a small tent, which approximates the layout seen at Utah Valley University.

It's an extraction shooter, and if you get one of those off the ground, it'll continue to be popular. Its largest impact on the industry has been the conversation around AI . The game's developed by Embark Studios, creators of The Finals , and has routinely dipped its toes into hot water over the usage of generative AI to produce voice lines. Statements have sometimes even contradicted each other. For example, in the story I just linked, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund was quick to emphasise that the studio wasn't using it to \"replace people\", even though replacing work you'd otherwise need a voice actor to come in and record is, uh, doing that. He then goes on to talk effusively about how Embark couldn't have made its two games without it, which strikes me as strange—either you replaced work that would've cost money you didn't have, or you didn't do that. I digress: You might think that after gathering some success, Embark would keep banging that drum. But in a recent interview with PCGN , …",

Videogame sequels usually come with the caveat that it's totally OK to skip the original. Even if doing so actually seems a bit absurd, like a direct follow-up to a story-driven RPG. It makes sense: devs don't want to give people too many reasons not to pick up their new game. But My Winter Car is a sequel to a game that was specifically advertised as \"not fun\". It's not going for mass appeal. Instead of the challenge level starting from scratch, it's meant to build on the trials and tribulations you faced in the original game. It features \"added challenge for those who can master the original game,\" the Steam page warns. Given the complexity of My Summer Car, this means you're probably going to have an absolutely horrible time, which for games like this is absolutely a selling point.

    "body": "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em! That's both the name of MC Hammer's third studio album and the phrase someone in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check should have said before promoting me to the title of doctor and handing me a large hammer. Unfortunately, they did not, so I am hurting 'em at every opportunity. Quarantine Zone is a first-person medical sim you've probably been seeing clips of for months: it was a huge hit on TikTok following its first demo, and since the full game launched today on Steam you can expect to see a lot more clips, like this one of me carefully examining a guy before clonking him on the head with a hammer. The sim is a bit like Papers, Please without the papers or the please: you inspect survivors of the zombie apocalypse for signs of infection before letting them into the safety a military outpost, while also doing some light resource management around the base and a bit of fairly rote turret defense beyond the walls. You begin with just a flashlight to look for signs of a zombie virus as the survivors stagger in, one by one. Does the subject have red eyes? Weird bruises? A blatantly obvious zombie bite? If they seem a bit sick you can send them to quarantine…",

I am writing this post to inform you, PC gamers who may not have played ingenious puzzle game Blue Prince, about a great deal. It is in no way merely a cover for me to revisit the topic of PC Gamer's official 2025 GOTY vote which I am definitely not still salty about here in 2026. * According to this very website , Blue Prince is the Best Designed game of 2025. True! But that award reflects that it was the runner-up to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which narrowly beat it for the top game of the year prize. To that result, I say: \"Rigged!!\" Okay, not rigged. But I believe I'll be vindicated by history in declaring this miraculous detective game, designed largely by a single mind over the course of eight years , as the game of 2025. I fought hard for Blue Prince to get PC Gamer's top GOTY honor, because I really don't think there's anything else like it out there. It contains so many layers of mystery and discovery—puzzles you didn't even know were puzzles for 10 or 20 hours, clues that may only make sense …",

Anyway, the bottom line is that those roots run deep, and so when Molyneux sticks his head up to say he's making his \" last game ,\" as he did in October 2025, we're obligated to pay attention. Right? Well, I am, anyway, and so it is that I'll be looking to give Masters of Albion a go when it drops on April 22. \"Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life's work, a game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, and Fable,\" Molyneux said. \"It's a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings god games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.\" Okay, yes, \"culmination of my life's work\" is very much a Molyneux P…",

In the years since it launched, GOG has expanded beyond 'good old games' to carry a selection of newer releases, but it remains relatively niche, and has never been a big moneymaker for CD Projekt. But in a new interview with GamesIndustry , Kiciński and GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski said there's room for it to flourish and find success, even in a marketplace so utterly dominated by Steam. The core of the strategy seems simple enough: Throwing hands with Steam is a bad idea, so don't do it. \"Steam is obviously a Goliath,\" said Gołębiewski. \"So for any company to try to tackle Steam is a very hard battle. We've seen Discord launch their store, we've seen Epic Games launch their store—and thanks to the lawsuit with Apple, we know how much it has cost them to launch this battle against Steam. \"So the fact that GOG is expanding, developing, and still kicking, I think it's a testament to the fact that GOG really has its space on the market with its mission of making games live forever.\" Gołębiewski said Steam is \"doing an awe…",
