(The private equity investment firm purchased them from Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings in 2020, who owned them through Braun’s acquisition of Swift’s former label Big Machine Records in 2019.) “To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it. To my fans, you know how important this has been to me — so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released four of my albums, calling them Taylor’s Version,” she wrote at the time in a letter on her website . “The passionate support you showed those albums and the success story you turned The Eras Tour into is why I was able to buy back my music.” After lying low professionally most of the summer, by August she made more headlines. Swift hopped on her then-boyfriend Travis Kelce ’s podcast with his brother Jason, to reveal her 12th studio album – The Life of a Showgirl – would make its curtain call in October. About two weeks later on Aug. 26, she broke the internet with the news: “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting marri…",

Speaking during her Not Alone Summit at Wynn Las Vegas in November, the singer, who has reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200 with six albums, reflected on the experience in an exclusive interview with PEOPLE , which first reported the story exclusively. According to Jewel, the incident took place in the summer of 1994, when she was 20 years old and traveling through Mexico with longtime collaborator Steve Poltz during a break from writing music. What began as a quiet songwriting retreat quickly escalated into something far more perilous. While spending time on a remote beach in Baja California, Jewel and Poltz were approached by armed men in uniform identifying themselves as Mexican federal police. After casually asking if the officers knew where they could go whale watching, the pair were invited onto a small boat — only to learn mid-trip that the officers were in the middle of an active drug bust. “They said, ‘We’re on a drug bust,’” Jewel recalled.

I come back to this hotel, and when I come back, three guys stand up like synchronized swimming.” According to Joe, the men approached him with a cryptic message: “The guys, they wanna shoot rockets with you.” When he asked who “the guys” were, the response instantly sent up red flags. “‘The Taliban, they love you,’” Joe recalled being told. “My a**hole got this tight, okay,” he joked, before clarifying that the situation didn’t feel like a joke at all. “I met the Taliban, it’s no f***ing bullshit.
