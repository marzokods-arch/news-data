Was someone in the room inadvertently streaming pornography from a personal device to the TV? Will anyone be prosecuted for what happened? Were the board members who complained about the video directed by the governor to \"lie about me,\" as the state's pugnacious, hard-right Superintendent of Education asked? Why was a \"chiropractic table\" involved in the scene? And why did the video feature, as one board member noted, a retro vibe and \"a guy with a white hat, kind of a Gilligan-type hat\"? We now have answers to all of those questions. After a lengthy investigation by the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office and the State Bureau of Investigation, and then a lengthy consideration of their reports, the Oklahoma County District Attorney this week announced that \"there is insufficient evidence to file criminal charges.\" Read full article Comments",

    "body": "In 2014, University of California, Berkeley biologist Robert Dudley wrote a book called The Drunken Monkey: Why We Drink and Abuse Alcohol . His controversial \" drunken monkey hypothesis \" proposed that the human attraction to alcohol goes back about 18 million years, to the origin of the great apes, and that social communication and sharing food evolved to better identify the presence of fruit from a distance. At the time, skeptical scientists insisted that this was unlikely because chimpanzees and other primates just don't eat fermented fruit or nectar. But reports of primates doing just that have grown over the ensuing two decades. Dudley co-authored a new paper published in the journal Science Advances reporting the first measurements of the ethanol content of fruits favored by chimps in Ivory Coast and Uganda, finding that the chimps are consuming 14 grams of alcohol every day, the equivalent of a standard alcoholic drink in the US. After adjusting for the chimps' lower body mass, the authors concluded the chimps are consuming nearly two drinks per day. Earlier this year, we reported that researchers had caught wild chimpanzees on camera engaging in what appears to be sharing…",

The National Academies of Science (NAS) decided that at least one aspect of that was probably right: Our understanding of the climate has changed in the last 15 years. So, it asked a group of scientists to do a quick update of our understanding of greenhouse gases, completed before public comment was closed on the EPA's plan. That report is now out , and the NAS's conclusion is clear: The EPA was right in 2009, and everything we've learned since has only made it more right.

    "body": "Summarizing complex scientific findings for a non-expert audience is one of the most important things a science journalist does from day to day. Generating summaries of complex writing has also been frequently mentioned as one of the best use cases for large language models (despite some prominent counterexamples ). With all that in mind, the team at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) ran an informal year-long study to determine whether ChatGPT could produce the kind of \"news brief\" paper summaries that its \"SciPak\" team routinely writes for the journal Science and services like EurekAlert . These SciPak articles are designed to follow a specific and simplified format that conveys crucial information, such as the study's premise, methods, and context, to other journalists who might want to write about it. Now, in a new blog post and white paper discussing their findings, the AAAS journalists have concluded that ChatGPT can \"passably emulate the structure of a SciPak-style brief,\" but with prose that \"tended to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity\" and which \"required rigorous fact-checking by SciPak writers.\" Read full article Comments",

From Raskin's early work on the Apple Macintosh to the Canon Cat and later his unique software implementations, you were guaranteed an interface you could sit down and interact with nearly instantly and—once you'd learned some basic keystrokes and rules—one you could be rapidly productive with. But no modern computer implements his designs directly, even though some are based on principles he either espoused or outright pioneered. Fortunately, with a little work and the magic of emulation, you can have your very own humane interface at home and see for yourself what computing might have been had we traveled a little further down Raskin's UI road. You don’t need to feed a virtual Cat Perhaps the most straightforward of Raskin's systems to emulate is the Canon Cat.

Rather than blocking scalping, Ticketmaster allegedly provided tech support to help so-called brokers exceed \"fake\" ticket limits that seemingly only applied to genuine customers buying tickets to see events.

Specifically, the cars will get a new dual Nvidia DRIVE AGX Orin setup, which Volvo says will improve performance and reduce battery drainage, as well as enabling some features that have been TBD so far. That will presumably be welcome news—the EX90 is a shining example of how the \"minimal viable product\" idea has infiltrated the auto industry from the tech sphere. That's because Volvo has had a heck of a time with the EX90 development, having to delay the EV not once but twice in order to get a handle on the car's software. Read full article Comments",

A criminal complaint unsealed on Thursday (PDF) said that Thalha Jubair, 19, of London, was part of Scattered Spider, the name of an English-language-speaking group that has breached the networks of scores of companies worldwide. After obtaining data, the group demanded that the victims pay hefty ransoms or see their confidential data published or sold. Bitcoin paid by victims recovered The unsealing of the document, filed in US District Court of the District of New Jersey, came the same day Jubair and another alleged Scattered Spider member—Owen Flowers, 18, from Walsall, West Midlands—were charged by UK prosecutors in connection with last year’s cyberattack on Transport for London . The agency, which oversees London’s public transit system, faced a monthslong recovery effort as a result of the breach. Read full article Comments",

These and other unusual research questions were honored tonight in a virtual ceremony to announce the 2025 recipients of the annual Ig Nobel Prizes. Yes, it's that time of year again, when the serious and the silly converge—for science. Established in 1991, the Ig Nobels are a good-natured parody of the Nobel Prizes; they honor \"achievements that first make people laugh and then make them think.\" The unapologetically campy awards ceremony features miniature operas, scientific demos, and the 24/7 lectures whereby experts must explain their work twice: once in 24 seconds and the second in just seven words. Acceptance speeches are limited to 60 seconds. And as the motto implies, the research being honored might seem ridiculous at first glance, but that doesn't mean it's devoid of scientific merit. In the weeks following the ceremony, the winners will also give free public talks, which will be posted on the Improbable Research website. Read full article Comments",

For people who use AI tools, some of these additions might actually be helpful, and for everyone else, well, Firefox still exists. The most prominent change, and one that AI subscribers may have already seen, is the addition of a Gemini button on the desktop browser. This button opens a popup where you can ask questions about—and get summaries of—content in your open tabs. Android phones already have Gemini operating at the system level to accomplish similar tasks, but Google says the iOS Gemini app will soon be built into Chrome for Apple devices.

The Cygnus XL supply ship will remain at the station for up to six months, during which time astronauts will unpack the spacecraft's cargo module and refill it with trash.
