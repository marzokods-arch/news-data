The second trailer for the movie starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson expands on the first peek at the struggling musicians who rise to fame as a Diamond-covering duo. The Craig Brewer-written and directed movie is based on the 2008 documentary of the same name that told the improbable story of Milwaukee husband and wife duo Mike and Claire Sardina. Expanding on the tease in the first trailer , which dropped in September, the new, nearly three-minute preview opens with Jackman&#8217;s long-haired Mike Sardina confessing, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a songwriter, I&#8217;m not a sex symbol, but I am an entertainer,&#8221; as Hudson stares into a mirror and says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna be a hairdresser.

On August 23, you played SUMMER SONIC for the first time with SUMMER SONIC BANGKOK 2025. AKANE (drums): I was so happy to finally be able to perform a OKYU-JI in Bangkok. We also had all kinds of special effects, like flames up on stage. It&#8217;s rare to see so many special effects being used at a festival, so I had a blast. SAIKI (vocals): The people of Thailand were so warm. From up on stage, you could tell that people loved rock—that they were really listening to our rock music. I felt really glad to have come to Thailand.&nbsp; KANAMI (guitar): I&#8217;m sure for a lot of the people there it was their first time seeing one of our OKYU-JI.

It was truly a universe thing, for sure.” Their couple’s romance serves as a muse for “Last Rodeo,” one of the songs on Mac’s multi-faceted third studio album, Southern Spectacle , which released Oct. 24. Growing up in tiny Russellville, Kentucky, just over an hour north of Nashville, Mac soaked in the country music sounds of artists including Garth Brooks and Shania Twain, but also pop icons such as Elton John. He also harbored dreams of singing country music. Mac moved to Nashville at age 22, and came out as gay shortly thereafter. But for several years, he says he recorded songs that refrained from fully expressing his queer identity through his music. In 2019, he released a self-titled EP, and while Mac …",

Yet, even as the act has littered Billboard &#8216;s rock- and alternative-focused charts, it never reached the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 — until last month. With the pop-leaning single &#8220;Dracula,&#8221; Tame Impala has officially sunk its teeth into the chart: Following a debut at No. 55 on the Oct. 11-dated list, it has lurked well beyond the shadows and scaled to a No. 33 high. Plus, the breakthrough may have opened the floodgates, as two other songs from the group&#8217;s recent album Deadbeat — released through Columbia Records on Oct. 17 — have since reached the Hot 100 (album opener &#8220;My Old Ways&#8221; and second single &#8220;Loser&#8221;).

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR JerryRigEverything tore down the REDMAGIC 11 Pro, calling it “the most powerful phone on the planet.” The teardown reveals the full circulating coolant loop and the largest vapor chamber he has seen in a phone. It survived all durability tests, booted up afterward, and even includes oil in the coolant for a lava lamp visual effect. Some people might see a phone with visible coolant sloshing around inside it as an accident waiting to happen. However, Zack Nelson of JerryRigEverything proves that the new REDMAGIC 11 Pro is anything but, as he reveals the secrets to what he calls “the most powerful phone on the planet.” In his new video , Nelson dismantles what REDMAGIC calls the world’s first mass-produced liquid-cooled smartphone. The 11 Pro’s blue coolant can actually be seen circulating the back when the phone is switched on, pumped by a microscopic piezoelectric motor that pushes liquid through a sealed loop. The system works in tandem with a 24,000 RPM internal fan and what Nelson describes as the largest vapor chamber he’s ever seen in a phone.",

I’ve had a Pixel 10 Pro for two months, and I regret nothing. The 10 Pro addresses my needs more than any Samsung model, and I’m worried about where Samsung is headed.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR Your Android phone may be lying to you about signal strength, showing more network bars than it actually should. Telecom providers can exploit a hidden Android feature to show you an “inflated” signal strength. AT&amp;T and Verizon have already been spotted using this tactic. Telecom carriers often battle over broader coverage, the number of zip codes covered by 5G , and faster speeds. These claims, based on the carriers’ own marketing teams, paint a picture that’s far from the actual scenario and are often even contradicted in actual reports by independent parties . However, while it’s natural for corporations to paint a brighter picture, Google has been found colluding with carriers, allowing them to display fake signal strength on your phone. Beyond tall marketing claims and fake 5G icons , carriers may also be lying through their teeth to you about signal strength. A recent report by Nick vs Networking highlights a flag, KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL , in the source code for Android’s Carrier Config Manager, related to artificially “inflating” the network strength.",

    "body": "TL;DR German-based brand, Tolino, just launched the Tolino Flip, a Bluetooth remote for turning the company’s e-book pages. The device follows Kobo’s Remote, which debuted earlier this month with the same functionality. These releases highlight a growing interest in remote page-turners, something Amazon currently doesn’t offer. When it comes to e-reading , we’ve grown comfortable with the touchscreen tap or swipe. However, a new wave of add-ons, namely Bluetooth remotes that bring physical buttons back into play, is reshaping how we flip through digital pages. This week, German-based Tolino, a Rakuten Kobo subsidiary, joined that movement with the launch of its own remote control page turner, signaling that Kobo’s influence extends beyond its own lineup. The Tolino Flip connects to compatible Tolino e-readers via Bluetooth with a range of roughly 20 meters. Measuring about 10 cm long and weighing just 26.5 grams, it features an ergonomic design, two tactile buttons for forward and backward turns, and a removable wrist strap. The device runs on a single AAA battery, promising months of use, and comes in black or white finishes. It is available now for preorder from the Tolino websi…",

With its upcoming One UI 8.5 interface , Samsung could be taking a bold step towards reshaping the interface that has remained largely unchanged for the past two generations. Some of these changes are controversial and hold the potential to spark off a fresh iOS vs. Android comparison. But there’s one change that I wholeheartedly look forward to: a striking revamp of the Quick Settings panel . Based on the leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to adopt Android 16’s extensive customization options for Quick Settings — with an extra shot of newness . Even before the One UI 8.5 beta has been released, I’m genuinely rooting for this option to be a reality and feel it could be a dramatic improvement — beyond visual appeal — to the panel that One UI has seen in recent years.",

This change will be introduced with the upcoming Nothing OS 4.0 beta update, scheduled for release by the end of the month. If there’s one peculiar characteristic of the Carl Pei-led tech brand Nothing, it’s the propensity for unusual choices and hot takes. The brand has consistently also maintained a strong stance on privacy. That is why its recent decision to include certain third-party apps on some of its phones from the factory sparked strong opposition from users. Now, it seems the brand is taking a half-step back and will allow users to delete some of these apps — but will continue to install them on some non-flagship phones.

AppHub was discontinued after reports showed it could silently install apps, so the uninstall message reflects its permanent removal and is not a system error or bug. As first spotted on Reddit by user OkAsk3950 , it seems many Android-owning T-Mobile customers have recently received the same message: “com.applovin.array.apphub.tmobile uninstalled successfully”.

Gemma remains accessible via API for developers, while the incident raises bigger questions about accountability and guardrails in public-facing AI tools. Google’s Gemma large-language model was introduced as a next-gen AI companion inside its AI Studio platform, designed to support developers with text generation, creative drafts, summaries, and more. It represented Google’s broader push toward open experimentation with its advanced models, until everything hit a snag. Google has now quietly pulled Gemma from the public developer interface. First reported by TechCrunch , the move follows a formal letter to CEO Sundar Pichai from Senator Marsha Blackburn , a Republican from Tennessee, who said Gemma produced a fabricated allegation when prompted with: “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?”",

This platform update is significant, as it introduces new features, including the Now Bar and revamped watch tiles, to existing smartwatch users. However, the update might have also caused some extra stress to users, if all the additional stress warnings are to be believed. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Google still has a long way to go to get its premier in-car phone mirroring product to that pinnacle. To be fair to Google, recent updates have addressed some of its user base’s biggest annoyances.

Anyone familiar with Google wouldn’t be surprised by this gesture — or by the period of confusion that follows, during which multiple apps with similar use cases continue to exist. So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026.

This is because the Exynos 2500 suffered some rather notable issues. First, production yield issues and delays meant Samsung had to skip the chip entirely for the Galaxy S25 series . When it finally arrived in the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the performance was pretty lackluster; in CPU performance, it was no faster than last year’s Snapdragon rival, and there were only marginal gains in graphics.",

With every new Android release, Google seemingly further restricts what apps running in the background can do. This is understandable because battery power is a finite commodity on Android phones , so allowing apps to do whatever they want whenever they want would be detrimental to battery life. To prevent rogue applications from draining your phone’s battery , the Android OS implements a number of battery management tactics to control when apps can run and how long they can run. Apps that need to perform critical, real-time tasks like downloading a file, tracking a run, or playing music can create a foreground service, but in order to do so, they must show a notification so users are aware. Instead of creating a foreground service, Google recommends most developers use APIs like JobScheduler and AlarmManager (or a higher-level wrapper, like WorkManager) to queue tasks in the background.",

It runs on the T-Mobile network, but as an MVNO, it already undercuts the big three networks by a wide margin. However, a new offer that you won’t see advertised on the site makes its 12-month plans even cheaper. For a limited time, new customers can get 30% off all 12-month fixed-data plans using the code YEAROFMINT . That drops the 5GB plan from $15 to $10.50 per month, paid upfront for the year. The code should automatically apply if you use this link or widget below, but it’s worth noting down just in case.",

    "body": "TL;DR Back in September, Alphabet blamed YouTube censorship policies on pressure from the Biden administration. Numerous YouTube executives have given testimony that directly rebuts that claim. Now Committee on the Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin is demanding answers. The past ten months have got to be the start of one of the most embarrassing years for tech heavyweights in recent memory. One after the other, firms like Apple, Meta, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, and of course, Google, have been prostrating themselves before a government administration they’d previously butted heads with . But in 2025, acquiescence is the name of the game, and rather than bracing for another four years of conflict, they’ve instead been kissing the ring. A few weeks back, that extended to YouTube performing a massive about-face on the necessary steps it had taken to ban some of the worst voices on its platform , spreading lies, hate, and disinformation — instead opening the door to restore their access. That move was telegraphed in late September when Alphabet legal counsel submitted a letter to the House Committee on the Judiciary, blaming COVID-era YouTube moderation policies on pressure the co…",

LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes .

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
