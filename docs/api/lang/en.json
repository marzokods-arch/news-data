I’m not exactly young myself as a millennial, but I’ve grown up in the digital age, which means I’ve picked up new tricks as they’ve come on the scene. Writing about them for a living helps quite a lot, too. But for my parents, these little Android features look like magic at times, and some of them can actually be game-changers. I’ve had to guide them through a couple of the tips more than once, but they’ve adopted many of them since. They’ve even impressed their friends with their newfound modern wizardry on occasion.",

Messages may automatically suggest an @mention when you start typing someone’s name. Being able to get someone’s attention by sending them an @username just feels incredibly natural to so many of us after years and years of these kind of interactions across social media. At this point, we’re honestly just surprised to find cases where it doesn’t work, and while the list of supported platforms includes Google stuff like Chats, so far that hasn’t extended to Messages. Earlier this year, we brought you an early preview of how @mentions in Messages were coming together, and now we’ve got some progress to share.

While tools exist to connect your Android phone to a Windows PC , these solutions often fall short of Apple’s integrations. This gap exists because Android and Windows are developed by different companies with competing interests, which complicates the creation of native, deeply integrated features. For example, Apple’s Handoff feature lets you seamlessly start a task on one device and pick it up on another. Google doesn’t currently offer a direct equivalent for Android, but mounting evidence suggests one is in the works. This new feature appears to be part of Google’s efforts to bring Android to PCs , which would enable the company to build more powerful cross-device experiences.",

It felt like before long, the iPhone would be the only actual small phone left — not a great sign for us Android fans. Then, things flipped. Small phones became cool again, bringing back the idea that less can be more, much to the delight of bona fide small phone fans and portable design champions like me. I’d go so far as to say that we’re in a golden age of small Android phones — or small phones in general. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 has settled at 6.2 inches, the iPhone 17 is a slightly larger 6.3, and even Google has a Pro-level Pixel with just a 6.3-inch display. And you know what? They’re all really good.

These options now range from bare-bones budget plans to services nearly identical to postpaid, yet the sheer number of prepaid brands can be overwhelming. Some advertise heavily, but many remain obscure. Are these lesser-known carriers worth your attention, or is the risk too high? It really depends on what you want and how much risk you’re willing to take. First, it’s important to understand that there’s no clear line on what qualifies as a lesser-known carrier, as it comes down more to your individual knowledge about the industry. Thanks to increased advertising, you’ve likely at least heard of Boost Mobile, Mint Mobile, Cricket Wireless, Metro by T-Mobile, and maybe even a few other options like Tello or Total.

The company could make an official announcement next week. It’s not much of a secret at this point that Amazon has been working on a new Linux-based operating system called Vega. The company is aiming to replace Android with this new OS on many of its products. However, a recent leak about an Amazon-made high-end tablet with the full Android experience raised some questions about Vega’s future.

Detailed Background Document Overview: What is an Uncrewed Aircraft System?&nbsp; An uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) can be defined as an aircraft without an operator or flight crew onboard the aircraft itself. UAS are remotely controlled using manual flight controls (i.e., teleoperation) or autonomously operated using uploaded control parameters (e.g., waypoints, altitude hold, or minimum/maximum airspeed for example).&nbsp; UAS are typically used to perform a variety of tasks or applications that are considered too dull, dangerous, dirty, or deep for humans or crewed platforms (also known as the “4Ds”). Their civilian/commercial uses include aerial photography/filming, agriculture, communications, conservation/wildlife monitoring, damage assessment/infrastructure inspection, fire services and forestry support, law enforcement/security, search and rescue, weather monitoring and research.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is working to improve the performance of graphical Linux apps on Android, which currently run slowly using inefficient CPU-based rendering. This will be achieved by implementing gfxstream, a technology that forwards graphics API calls to the host’s GPU for near-native performance. Evidence for this was found in a hidden “Graphics Acceleration” setting in the Terminal app that enables a new “GPU-accelerated renderer.” Earlier this year, Google introduced the Linux Terminal app , giving developers and power users the ability to run full-fledged Linux applications on their Android devices. While it was initially limited to command-line apps, Google recently added support for running Linux apps with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), a significant step forward for the feature. However, there’s a major catch with the current implementation. All graphics rendering is handled by the CPU instead of the GPU, which is not only incredibly slow but also very taxing on a device’s battery and thermals. This is only a temporary problem, though, as Google is already working on a new feature that will make these apps run significantly better.",

It has been increasingly important to strategically improve the agricultural industry to continue to provide for communities. Agriculture faces many challenges such as production delays, pests and disease, weather and climate impacts, and financial sustainability of the agricultural industry itself. To battle these challenges, the agriculture industry must adapt and grow innovatively by embracing new technology to become more resilient and more efficient. &nbsp; NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) focuses on integrating drones into the US national airspace system (NAS), with a focus on creating a system that is accessible, safe, and affordable.

YouTube TV’s multiview feature is one of my favorite things about the streaming service, especially right now during football season when I can have four games playing simultaneously on any given Sunday. Unfortunately, multiview hasn’t been working very well for a lot of YouTube TV subscribers. For the last couple of weeks, the r/YouTubeTV subreddit has been flooded with user complaints about multiview being hampered by extremely low picture quality, including comments about multiview streams appearing blocky and “sometimes unviewable.”",

But what’s caught the eye is another sky-high performance metric — 100W charging . Ah, I hear you exclaim, 100W charging in a phone is hardly news — proprietary charging standards from China hit that benchmark years ago. But Xiaomi is doing something different this year. It supports this lickety-split power level over the universal USB Power Delivery PPS protocol. That’s the very same protocol used by the far slower Google and Samsung, amongst others, and it’s not just reserved for the Ultra model either.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is apparently preparing two AI-based connectivity toggles in One UI 8.5. Both of these toggles would automatically decide when your phone switches from mobile data to Wi-Fi. It seems like one toggle could let your phone automatically switch to mobile data based on places where you’ve manually made the switch. Many Android phones today offer an option to seamlessly switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi as needed. This is particularly useful if you’ve got a poor Wi-Fi connection, allowing you to automatically switch to mobile data for a better experience. However, it looks like Samsung could offer two ways to customize this switch-over experience. SammyGuru reports that One UI 8.5 has two AI-related toggles that govern when you switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data. The first toggle is called Intelligent Link Assessment , and switches your phone from Wi-Fi to mobile data based on “Wi-Fi link data.” I’m guessing this means the phone will look at your Wi-Fi connection’s speed, latency, and other factors before deciding to switch. That’s pretty similar to the option seen on phones from other companies.",

Earlier this summer, Mint Mobile brought back its exceptional 50% off promotion for annual customers interested in an unlimited plan. If you’ve yet to take advantage, you don’t have much longer, as the promotion is set to end on the last day of September. While it’s possible the deal will return eventually, it’s unlikely to return anytime soon. This deal brings service down to the equivalent of just $15 a month, though you’ll have to pay the full $180 upfront.

That happens far too often with cable companies temporarily dropping channels after failing to work out deals, and right now we’re worried that YouTube TV could be headed for just that kind of confrontation.

It follows earlier restrictions like removing USB transfers and blocking downloads on older versions of the Kindle Android app. Amazon just rolled out a change to its Kindle e-readers that could frustrate anyone who likes to keep permanent copies of their e-books . The newest firmware update, version 5.18.5, strengthens Amazon’s Digital Rights Management (DRM) — the copy-protection system that prevents people from freely backing up or transferring Kindle books. Goodereader reported the change, citing a post on the Mobileread forum that the publication identified as from one of the lead developers of a jailbreak method. In the poster’s explanation, they said the new system applies fresh encryption to any newly downloaded e-books, regardless of when they were originally purchased or published. Books where the publisher has opted out of copy-protection are not affected.",

Features like Theft Detection use sensors to know when a thief grabs your phone and makes a break for it, while Offline Device Lock prevents a thief from using a lack of connectivity to give them more time with an unlocked handset. Android also has some useful manual tools, like Remote Lock, and that one’s finally getting an important upgrade. Remote Lock was built to address an important need: Someone steals your device, but you don’t immediately have access to another device where you’re signed into your account to use the Find Hub and its security tools. And if you’re using 2FA like you should, signing into a new device without your phone could be a little tricky.

With Amazon’s next Prime sale just weeks away, the company could have done without the headlines its subscription service is making today. Amazon just agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle claims it made Prime signups too easy and cancellations too hard. As reported by The New York Times , the settlement came just days into a Seattle jury trial stemming from a 2023 Federal Trade Commission lawsuit . Regulators accused Amazon of steering people into Prime memberships during checkout by highlighting free shipping perks while playing down the cost, and then making it difficult to leave with a cancellation process that involved multiple screens and pressure offers.",

Apple’s latest phones hit store shelves last week, and the iPhone 17, 17 Air, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max are all available for purchase right now. The iPhone 17 series features some striking new designs, but early testing has revealed an issue: several of the new models seem especially prone to scratching in certain areas. Apple’s now acknowledged the problem, but its response probably won’t do much to soothe affected buyers. About five minutes into JerryRigEverything ‘s iPhone 17 Pro durability test video, the channel’s Zack Nelson clearly demonstrates the issue. While the 17 Pro’s anodized aluminum finish is mostly able to resist scratching when rubbed with a coin, the finish gives way around the sharp edges of the phone’s new camera plateau. Zack says this is down to a confluence of thin anodization applied over a sharp corner, making for an especially vulnerable finish in that area.",

The OnePlus 15 is one of those upcoming devices. Ahead of its arrival, the brand has already begun teasing the flagship, and we’ve just got our first official glimpse at it. In addition to the Summit in Hawaii, Qualcomm is also hosting a similar one specifically for China. It is at this event that a OnePlus representative showcased the design of the OnePlus 15.",

With a slim design that makes people around you say, “Wow,” it’s unlike any iPhone we’ve seen before. At just 5.6mm thick and weighing 165g, the iPhone Air is a breeze to hold, making it a very comfortable smartphone to use throughout the day. More than anything else, it is an excellent recommendation for people who want to make a style statement, spec sheet be damned.",

Other upgrades include RGB lighting, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD via an M.2 slot. The Raspberry Pi 500 Plus is available at a starting price of $200. The Raspberry Pi 400 was an intriguing release back in 2020, as it was the first official Raspberry Pi computer built into a keyboard. This effectively enabled an all-in-one PC experience. We’ve since seen the Raspberry Pi 500, and now the company has upped the ante with the Raspberry Pi 500 Plus. The Raspberry Pi 500 Plus is indeed a full-fledged Raspberry Pi computer built into a keyboard, but it offers various major upgrades over the Pi 500. For one, we’ve now got a mechanical keyboard with removable keycaps and RGB lighting.",

    "summary": "Though it won't be as effortless as searching with Pixel Screenshots!",
    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a “More like this” feature to search similar-looking images. The results display identical images in a grid, allowing you to easily sort or delete pictures. While results aren’t very accurate currently, we can expect them to mature as the feature nears its release. For most Android users, Google Photos is a great way to store and share photos across multiple devices. However, it also becomes the default dumping ground for unnecessary or unpicturesque, yet still useful, images, which can compound if you tend to keep automatic backups turned on. Finding those images can be challenging, especially if you don’t own a Pixel, which makes the process easier with the Pixel Screenshots app. Thankfully, that may be alleviated to some degree with an upcoming feature update.
