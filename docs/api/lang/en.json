The absence isn't a Steam decision, though: Developer Hypixel Studios says it just doesn't want to be there at this early stage of the game. That's very counter-intuitive: Steam is far and away the dominant PC storefront, and conventional wisdom states that if you're not there, you're missing out on a major chunk of potential revenue. Witness, for instance, the reaction to the recent ban of Horses on Steam : Yeah, it was also dropped by the Epic Games Store and, for a day, Humble, but Steam is the one that really hurt, and developer Santa Ragione said losing it might force the studio to close. But Hypixel Studios has a very good reason for taking a pass on it: Steam user reviews. \"We want to spend our time in Early Access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing,\" Hytale executive director Patrick \"Lyall\" Derbic wrote in a new FAQ . \"Steam is a great marketing tool but one that we might never need.

As first reported by Insider Gaming , the layoffs impacted people in a wide range of roles—at least a dozen in total, according to a message posted by presentation director Timothé Lapetite. \"Eidos-Montréal got served with one of those Mondays,\" he wrote in a message posted last week . \"We had to part ways with some incredible talent due to *gestures at everything*.\" Sources also told the site that most projects in the studio have also been cancelled, and that it is now focused on co-developing projects including Grounded 2 , led by Obsidian, and the Fable reboot being headed up by Playground Games. Neither Eidos nor parent company Embracer Group (yes, it's an Embracer studio) have confirmed the layoffs or responded to requests for comment. This would be the second round of layoffs at Eidos Montreal in 2025, following a cut of roughly 75 employees in March . The studio previously laid off 97 workers , and cancelled an unannounced Deus Ex game it had in development in early 2024. The layoffs seem…",

Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Tamer Town now on Steam The trailer pans over a brightly coloured metropolis filled with grand mansions and featuring an all-important arena where trainers from your town will fight your Pokémon-like Mokiton. These are evolving creatures of all shapes, sizes, and specialisms that improve \"not through training alone, but through their bonds.\" It details some of the core gameplay mechanics we can expect from this genre mashup, including cozy city-building elements and intense battles between trainers. The in-game autobattles between Mokiton are described as a fusion between real-time and tactical turn-based combat. It'll be interesting to see how those mechanics really blend together in practice, but from the merging of city building and arena combat it's clear Tamer Town is all about combining unexpected elements to make something unique. The devs are currently working on a roguelike adventure set in the same universe called…",

This singleplayer horror spectacle doesn't shun the taboo indulgences of sadism and masochism, but instead embraces them in their most brutal and visceral form. \"Anything less would not be a Hellraiser game\", says Esov. As they speak, scenes of intensely violent melee combat between the player and leather-clad assailants—I imagine emboldened by their immense pain thresholds—flash across the screen. There are meat-hooked bodies, splayed victims, and a plinth holding a heart that seems to beat without a body. \"I don't think anyone saw a Hellraiser game of th…",

Lead artist Colby Wahl estimates the team has \"gone through probably 100 different variations of the skate mechanic,\" a process that led chief creative officer Mikey Spano to actively push to \"cut it\" despite his love for the idea. Now, however, he \"can't imagine the game without it\" as the skateboard has become central to pretty much everything you do in the sequel.
