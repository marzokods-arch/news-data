This interview series spotlighting female players across the Japanese entertainment industry is one of the key pillars of Japan’s WIM project. This installment features Maki Goto, who marks the 25th anniversary of her debut this year. The singer joined Morning Musume at just 13 and has continued to chart her own course as a solo artist after graduating from the wildly popular J-pop girl group. Now, looking back on the past 25 years of her career — guided by the belief that she didn’t need to play the “good girl” — the 40-year-old performer shares the unexpected message she would offer her younger self today. She also reflects on the mindset that has sustained her throughout her life in the spotlight. Congratulations on your 25th anniversary. How are you feeling as you reach this milestone?

These messages are not official. If you get a message in Samsung Members threatening fees, do not reply or click any links in it. Samsung Members is an app that offers a grab-bag of functionality to Galaxy device users, from support and diagnostics to “exclusive perks” like device discounts. The app also allows users to message each other — and that feature is currently being abused by scammers. A post by user GaryB82 on the US Samsung Community forums details the message that’s been circulating. In the scam, an account posing as an official Samsung channel says that the recipient’s account urgently needs “verification,” directing the user to click a link and supply personal info. Failure to comply, the message says, comes with a fine. It might go without saying, but if you’ve seen received of these messages, do not click the link.",

    "body": "TL;DR Strong evidence has surfaced confirming that “Cinnamon Bun” is the internal dessert codename for Android 17. A reference to “CINNAMON_BUN” was discovered within the code of the latest Android Canary release. The OS is currently using the placeholder API level 10000, but it will eventually graduate to API level 37. Development on Android 17 is well underway, but we still don’t know much about the next major OS update. While we have an inkling about some of its potential new features, we lack concrete evidence confirming they’ll be included. We’ve even heard through the grapevine that Android 17’s dessert codename is “ Cinnamon Bun ,” but without official confirmation, we couldn’t be sure. Fortunately, we’ve now found strong evidence confirming that “Cinnamon Bun” is indeed the internal moniker.

These include ANC controls, auto play-pause, battery status, head gesture detection, and more. The app also unlocks accessibility settings, such as transparency mode customization and the ability to use your AirPods as hearing aids. The only caveat here is that you cannot use the features without rooting your phone. Apple has always used a pretext of privacy to keep its devices exclusive and limited to its ecosystem. The same issue occurs with AirPods, which, despite using Bluetooth as the medium, lack basic app controls when connected to a non-Apple device, resulting in a severely limited experience. Thankfully, there’s an app that addresses the limitations when AirPods are paired to Android devices . While apps, such as OpenPods , already let you leverage some of the features, this newer app takes it several notches higher. LibrePods, by developer Kavish Devar, is an app that enables you to utilize full AirPods functionality when connected to an Android device.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Starting in 2026, Apple is reportedly planning to separate phone launches across fall and the following spring. This two-part annual release schedule could predictably cause a reactionary split in Android flagship launches, with more premium models launching in the fall, and budget and value options launching in the coming spring. Ever since the iPhone 4S was launched in 2011, Apple has typically introduced its main phone lineup in September or October. Android smartphone manufacturers previously prioritized a flagship launch at events like MWC. However, over the years, it seemed that the entire industry had been inching closer to releasing the best new Android phones closer to Apple’s latest iPhone. This year, it’s the closest Android flagship SoCs have launched next to Apple’s SoC, and consequently, new Android flagships have arrived closer to the iPhone 17 series . Just as Android OEMs were about to settle into this rhythm, Apple seems to be on its way to run at a different pace. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

But even as a Kindle die-hard, the more I use it, the more I’ve realised that for all its strengths, it’s a device that is truly living in Amazon’s walled garden, and is essentially behind much of the competition. You can’t really change how it looks beyond the basics. While you can add fonts, they won’t work with every e-book format. You can’t stop ads without paying extra. You can’t even stop it from downloading updates. The Kindle is designed to be a fully gated experience, and over time, that’s started to bother me. Even more so once I discovered that there is a way to unlock the Kindle’s full capabilities and bring it on par with competitors like the Kobo lineup. All it takes is a jailbreak to unlock the Linux-based Kindle’s full functionality.",

Unfortunately, emulation and a shortage of time don’t really go hand in hand.

At launch, T-Mobile promised the consolidated experience would be an upgrade for customers, making it easier to manage services and perform account-level tasks without calling customer service or jumping through hoops. As we approach 2026, the question remains: Is T-Life really as bad as some think, or has it finally matured into something worth using?",

The amount of the discount appears to vary per customer, with some getting $10 per line and others getting $20 per line. Verizon hasn’t exactly had the best year, as the carrier has been hemorrhaging customers . However, this has been a problem of its own making as it decided to cut loyalty discounts, raise fees, and remove perks . Even after reinstating discounts for users threatening to leave, the situation got worse after customers felt tricked into accepting lower discounts. But it looks like Verizon hasn’t given up on trying to retain its existing subscribers, as a new wave of discounts are rolling out. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Android and iOS have long reached points of maturity, and it’s no secret that both Google and Apple look at each other’s operating systems for “inspiration” on what to add to their own. We’ve seen iOS copy features like widgets, free app icon placement on the home screen, and more from Android. On the other hand, we spotted Google working on a Contact Posters-like feature for Android , which the company eventually rolled out as Calling Cards .

The listing promises features such as a 7.3-inch HD screen, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 6,800mAh battery, a “108MP+72MP” camera, a stylus with an integrated stylus slot, and a microSD card slot. If the microSD support is indeed confirmed, that means this Galaxy S26 Ultra clone has a feature that the real S26 Ultra likely won’t have.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR • Samsung originally planned a slimmer Galaxy S26 with a larger battery but reversed course due to Apple’s decision to maintain a $799 price tag for the iPhone 17. Samsung’s revised plan appears to retain the previous dimensions of the S26, with a smaller increase in battery capacity, while focusing on maintaining competitive pricing. Samsung will differentiate Galaxy S models by intent, offering a price-focused base model, a balanced Plus version, and a feature-rich Ultra model. The Galaxy S26 series has been in the news a whole lot before its launch, primarily for all the plan changes that Samsung is making at a relatively late stage of product development. The company reportedly killed the Galaxy S26 Edge and revived the Galaxy S26 Plus, but it has also been making a few other tweaks to the lineup. A new report now sheds light on the reason behind some of these changes, and the answer is surprisingly simple: Apple. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Naturally, users quickly noticed that the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, Pixel 7, and Pixel 7 Pro were missing from the list of devices receiving Google’s monthly bug-fix update. Folks also speculated that Google is dropping monthly updates for the phones in favor of quarterly patches.
