The “Call Home” feature allowed you to call the smart display from your phone while using the same Google account. A Redditor noted the option has vanished from the app following the recent redesign. The other alternative is to call other users over Meet, but it requires their accounts to be added to the display as well. In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language. Now that Meet has replaced Duo, Google seems to be killing the option to call your home devices.

This is a paid application that also serves as a file manager. If you use a Wear OS smartwatch with your Android flagship, chances are that you’ve been tempted by the newer watch faces that Google has released for the Pixel Watch 4 . It’s possible to install these watch faces on other watches, but you need to know how to sideload using ADB on your smartwatch. While the process is straightforward if you can follow a guide , it’s admittedly still a bit too complicated for the average user.

The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70. The Motorola logo sits in the middle and seems to blend with each color, and the back texture looks more like something meant to add grip than decoration.",

Google Gemini is catching up to ChatGPT in active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told workers Monday that OpenAI has entered “code red” when it comes to improving the quality of ChatGPT, per an internal memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and The Information . According to Altman, the company has more to do to improve the quality of its core product — specifically in personalization features, speed and reliability, and allowing ChatGPT to answer more questions. In order to focus on these goals, Altman reportedly says in the memo, OpenAI is delaying planned additional features like ads in ChatGPT, AI agents for shopping and other tasks, and a digital personal assistant called Pulse.",

Claims can be filed online with a Class Member ID or by mailing a printed form, and payments are expected in early to mid-2026. We first reported on a major AT&amp;T data breach settlement back in August , which at the time was set to pay up to $177 million in total, with impacted customers able to claim upwards of $5,000. While this was originally supposed to happen back in November, it seems the dates and planned payouts have shifted a bit. As first reported by IBT , the final breakdown will see some users paid as much as $7,500, and the new deadline to file is December 18. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The America 250 emblem is now on the twin solid rocket boosters of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket for Artemis II — the powerhouse that will launch a crew of four around the Moon next year. Unveiled Tuesday, the design echoes the America 250 Commission’s Spirit of Innovation theme, honoring a country that has never stopped pushing the horizon forward. At NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, technicians spent recent weeks carefully applying the emblem on the rocket inside the Vehicle Assembly Building — the same place where rockets for Apollo once stood. Engineers are running final tests on SLS and the Orion spacecraft as preparations intensify for Artemis II. The roughly 10-day Artemis II journey around the Moon will mark a defining moment in this new era of American exploration — paving the way for U.S. crews to land on the lunar surface and ultimately push onward to Mars. America’s spirit of discovery is alive, and Artemis is carrying it to the Moon and beyond. Image credit: NASA/Ben Smegelsky",

As the name implies, it will have the same 4:3, 4.7-inch 120Hz IPS display as the RG Slide and RG 477M , which is one of the most impressive panels we’ve tested for retro games.

In fact, I originally switched to Android (Google Pixel 2 XL “panda edition,” which is still one of my favorite designs) specifically because I liked the images that Google’s camera app produced. Year over year, camera upgrades brought significant upgrades that — for me, at least — warranted buying a new phone each year. But in more recent years, the improvements have been less dramatic and, in many cases, not very noticeable to the average user. As someone who has continued to upgrade most years, this made me wonder how Google’s latest device stacks up against one of its predecessors , so I decided to compare the Pixel 8 Pro to my latest Pixel 10 Pro . Let’s dig into the pixels to see how a two-year-old device stacks up against Google’s latest efforts. Are you sure we’re using two different devices? Let’s start with the main camera . The lens itself is identical on both devices, so in theory, the images should be relatively similar.",

A new chip on the playback screen appears when audio is enhanced with Clear Voice, allowing you to revert to the original audio if needed. Google added a Clear Voice toggle to the Recorder app for Pixels in December 2024, shortly after we had spotted the feature in development . Clear Voice reduces background noise during recording, making it quite handy for recordings.

Sgr B2 is the most massive, and active star-forming region in our galaxy, located only a few hundred light years from our central supermassive black hole. While Sgr B2 has only 10% of the galactic center’s gas, it produces 50% of its stars. Astronomers want to figure out why it is so much more active than the rest of the galactic center. MIRI has both a camera and a spectrograph that sees light in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. MIRI’s view reveals colorful stars punctuated occasionally by bright clouds of gas and dust. Further research into these stars will reveal details of their masses and ages, which will help astronomers better understand the process of star formation in this dense, active galactic center region.

After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.

    "summary": "Alongside the OnePlus Watch Lite, OnePlus has also shared key details about the OnePlus 15R and OnePlus Pad Go 2.",
    "body": "TL;DR The OnePlus 15R will debut globally on December 17, featuring the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, G2 Wi-Fi chip, Detailmax Engine camera technology, an IP69K resistance rating, and a 165Hz 1.5K AMOLED display. Launching alongside, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 will feature a glare-resistant 12.1-inch 2.8K display, Open Canvas support, an integrated stylus, and 5G connectivity. The new Europe-only OnePlus Watch Lite will introduce dual-phone pairing (supporting both Android-Android and Android-iPhone pairs), a high-brightness AMOLED display, dual-band GPS, and more. The OnePlus 15R, OnePlus Pad Go 2, and OnePlus Watch Lite are officially confirmed for launch on December 17, 2025, in global markets. While the 15R and Pad Go 2 are destined for the US market, the OnePlus Watch Lite will be restricted to Europe. OnePlus has now shared additional specifications and details about the three products, providing a clearer idea of what to expect from them, and we’re blown away by the Watch Lite’s cross-OS dual-phone pairing capabilities.
