    "body": "With her visit to Cali, Colombia, Oct. 25-26, Shakira &#8216;s concerts were the biggest in the city in recent years. As part of her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour, the Barranquilla-born artist transformed the Pascual Guerrero Stadium into a massive gathering place for more than 77,000 attendees (between both nights), generating a historic economic impact in the capital of Valle del Cauca and positioning herself as the artist with the largest audience at that venue. Days before, the city was buzzing with intense preparations and great anticipation. Restaurants, hotels, shops and cultural services saw a significant increase in activity, with estimates of between 2,500 and 4,000 temporary jobs created by the event. Each of Shakira&#8217;s performances brought in up to $20 million in revenue for Cali, making the artist a driver of cultural and economic development, as she did in her performances in Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is working on a new user interface for Messages that’ll swap the hamburger menu for a context menu. The updated context menu will centralize buttons for sharing and selecting chats, making them easier to reach. It should also clarify which chats are selected or unselected in a group, which was previously confusing with Material You shading. Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

With Halloween week upon us, it probably isn’t the best time for your smart home to start suggesting that people you aren’t familiar with have been wandering your property. However, a couple of Reddit users claim their Google Home devices have started describing people they don’t know. According to a post on the r/googlehome subreddit , a user’s Nest camera described an activity summary saying “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” even though no one by that name lives there. When the user asked about it, Google’s assistant reportedly replied that its camera “can identify faces even if you haven’t explicitly named them,” and that it had spotted “Michael” between October 26 and 27. The user said they’d never entered that name into the system, but the actions described were what he himself had done. He found the response …",

On Twitter, Tarun Vats has shared screenshots that show the Galaxy S23 and S24 series are once again able to download One UI 8 in South Korea.

More details will be revealed in a livestream tomorrow morning, but it won’t be cheap. While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",

The phone also loses Hasselblad branding, while the camera hardware could be a sidegrade. OnePlus has been teasing the OnePlus 15 for weeks ahead of its launch event, revealing battery info, some camera details, and more. Thankfully, the wait for a full reveal is over, as OnePlus has just launched the device in China today. We’ve already seen the phone’s design, featuring flat edges with curved corners and a redesigned rear camera bump. OnePlus says the phone also has IP69 and IP69K ratings, which are overkill but still welcome after years of IP rating disappointment. Take a closer look at the left edge of the phone, and you’ll see a remappable shortcut button in lieu of the trademark alert slider. That’s a significant move after years of OnePlus flagships using the slider key (with the exception of the OnePlus 10T). Nevertheless, this shortcut key can be used for ringing profiles, AI functionality, taking screenshots, and more.",

    "body": "TL;DR Retroid has announced two handhelds, the Pocket G2 and the Pocket 6. The former is the first device with a Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 SoC, with the latter sporting a G2 Gen 2. The Pocket G2 launches soon at $199 for the first two weeks, with the Pocket 6 launching at a later date. There has been a flurry of new Android gaming handheld releases over the past few months, and today, Retroid finally joined the action. The company announced its highly anticipated follow-up to the Retriod Pocket 5, as well as a surprising new handheld that might end up being a better buy. The surprise handheld here is the Pocket G2, which is the first gaming handheld to ship with Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 chipset. Designed specifically for gaming handhelds, it should have more power and better sustained performance than Retroid’s previous flagship. The company claims it’s “almost 2x faster than the Retroid Pocket 5,” which has the aging Snapdragon 865.",

The Phone (3a) Lite is expected to be a downgrade from the regular Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro. While Nothing is teasing it as a new phone, a prominent leaker says it may just be an existing phone with minor changes. The fourth and final member of Nothing’s Phone (3) series has been speculated for a while. And in no time, it is set to be a reality with a global launch slated for this week. Nothing has just confirmed it will launch a new phone in a few days’ time, i.e., on October 29. As previously rumored, this is the Nothing Phone (3a) Lite, where the suffix presumably hints that this is an inferior version of the Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro launched earlier this year.",

Most of us would probably answer no to that question, and yet that’s exactly what companies like OpenAI and Perplexity are asking us to do with their new AI browsers, Atlas and Comet . OpenAI’s Atlas is a new browser with ChatGPT built-in, and it goes much further than Google’s addition of Gemini to Chrome. Atlas has agentic capabilities meaning the AI can surf the internet on your behalf by opening tabs, navigating to specific websites, clicking on buttons, and even filling in text fields. If that sounds like a potential game-changer, I’d like to temper that excitement because it’s also a big security gamble. Here’s why I’m not switching to Atlas in a hurry.",

After experimenting with the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, Samsung released its first XR (extended reality) headset earlier this month. Very soon, it may unveil its most hyped device of the year in the form of the triple-folding smartphone. And, as per recent reports, we may not have to wait much longer to witness this new marvel. As per industry sources, Samsung’s tri-fold is set to make its official appearance as early as this week. The Korea Herald reports the (supposedly named) Galaxy Z TriFold will be unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit, scheduled to take place in the Gyeongju province in South Korea.",

The app differs from NetherSX2 due to its open-source nature and its use of a more recent foundation. NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution. Fortunately, the ARMSX2 emulator has been in testing for a while, and it’s finally received a version 1.0 release. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

One of the first options I picked up was Metro by T-Mobile , mainly because I’d never really had any firsthand experience with it. Previously, my impression of Metro was that it was a lot like Total and Cricket, only somewhat worse. After all, Total and Cricket are similarly priced, and yet they at least offer higher-priority data on their more expensive plans. I’ve now come to realize that much of my earlier impression had more to do with T-Mobile’s performance in my area than with any real failing on Metro’s part.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

The smartphone has become our modern Swiss Army knife, bundling practically unlimited disparate functions into a single pocketable device. Still, arguably the most important feature in any smartphone is that it’s, well, a phone, letting us make calls from anywhere. In emergency situations, the phone part of the smartphone is all the more important — but Google’s phones are reportedly having a hard time there. Android Police has rounded up some recent reports from Reddit that say the Pixel 10 , Pixel 9, and Pixel 8 have all had issues contacting emergency services in the US, with calls failing to go through. These reports are anecdotal, but any failed call to 911 could potentially have disastrous consequences.",

Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole.

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s newly released $1,800 Galaxy XR headset includes support for bootloader unlocking. Unlike competitors like Meta Quest or Apple Vision Pro, this makes the Galaxy XR uniquely accessible for enthusiasts and developers. It’s unclear whether this was intended by Samsung or an oversight that will be patched, but it opens doors for custom ROMs and other software mods. Samsung just launched the Project Moohan headset this week, rebranding it as the Samsung Galaxy XR . It’s the first Android XR headset that people can buy, so there’s a lot of excitement behind the product despite its $1,800 price tag. It seems Samsung has given users one more reason to be excited: bootloader unlocking. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Atlas’ product lead says most of the features listed below will arrive shortly, while some, including tab groups, profiles, and the ad blocker may take some time. While Atlas is available on Mac, OpenAI is working to bring it to other platforms, though not anytime soon. The overbearing success of agentic browsers, such as Comet and Dia, recently inspired another AI pioneer to take a plunge into the arena with its own browser. Yes, I’m referring to OpenAI’s recent launch of the Atlas browser , which already makes Chrome seem archaic in comparison. But it’s still lacking some key features, like multiple profiles and tab groups, which OpenAI is now working to fix. Following the clamorous launch of its Atlas browser powered by ChatGPT, OpenAI is already working to make it better with additional features. Adam Fry, Atlas’ product lead, shared a list of new features or fixes to be rolled out to the browser over the coming weeks.",

It offers a significantly more powerful CPU and GPU compared to the previous generation, as well as a 4nm design. This chip will likely power a variety of cheap Android phones. Qualcomm ‘s Snapdragon 6 series of processors powers a variety of cheap Android phones , from Motorola and Xiaomi to Samsung and HONOR. Now, the company has revealed the Snapdragon 6s Gen 4, which brings some notable improvements. For starters, Qualcomm says this is the first Snapdragon 6 series chip built on a 4nm manufacturing process (Samsung). That’s a notable deal, as a smaller manufacturing process typically results in a more efficient chipset and improved performance. There’s no word on specific efficiency gains compared to the 6nm Snapdragon 6s Gen 3, though.",

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.
