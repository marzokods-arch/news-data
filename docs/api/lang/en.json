    "body": "Olivia Rodrigo closed out her blockbuster Guts World Tour with a secret show in New York City on Thursday night (Oct. 23), playing to an intimate crowd of fans, friends, and celebrity guests inside the historic Park Avenue Armory.

During the opening number, their 1987 hit “Welcome to the Jungle” at Estadio Huracán, Rose was visibly frustrated, kicking the bass drum, hurling his microphone toward the kit, and storming offstage after stripping off his leather jacket.

Minutes later, Rose returned to the stage and addressed the situation with a terse, “So, I’ll just try and wing this,” before continuing the set. On Tuesday (Oct. 22), the band released a statement via social media explaining the cause of the disruption. According to the post, the issue stemmed from an in-ear monitor malfunction. “During the opening song at our recent Buenos Aires concert, Axl’s in-ear monitor pack had only the percussion in his ears versus his entire mix,” the statement read. “The issue was fixed by our tech team by the third song, and we had a great night. The situation had nothing to do with Isaac Carpenter’s playing, who is top-notch and a great drummer.” Ferrer’s “amicable” …",
