    "body": "TL;DR Samsung Galaxy phones appear to be far less desirable to thieves than iPhones, prompting some to give robbery victims their devices back. Mobile phone thefts, usually snatch-and-grabs, are rising, but thieves reportedly prefer iPhones due to their enhanced resale value. Since thieves don’t want your Samsung Galaxy phone, you might get to keep it in the event of a robbery. It’s safe to say that, in 2025, the notion that Android phones are cheaper than iPhones simply isn’t true. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs more than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and that’s without getting into the foldable phone market, where Samsung charges $2,000 for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. In fact, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold could hit the $3,000 mark . Phone thieves apparently didn’t get the memo. Smartphone theft is rampant in the London, with the UK’s Metropolitan Police reporting 117,211 mobile phone thefts in the city in 2024 alone. While the Metropolitan Police doesn’t track theft data by smartphone brand, it appears thieves have a preference. A feature in the London Centric blog profiled Sam, a 32-year-old Londoner who was robbed for his phone, camera, and beanie hat by an eight-man mob. Shortly…",

    "body": "In the book Silence of the Lambs , author Thomas Harris opens by describing the Behavioral Science department of Quantico — where the FBI studies serial murder — as being on the bottom floor of the building, &#8220;half-buried in the earth.&#8221; Symbolically, it establishes that the darkest behaviors of the human psyche are explored almost in a subterranean bunker, as if the floor is a pipeline to the underworld itself. This imagery is what partially inspired In The Earth Again , the haunting collaborative album between Oklahoma City metal band Chat Pile and Texas guitarist Hayden Pedigo that dropped on Halloween. The album is bound by this post-apocalyptic vision of the earth slowly decaying into cancerous piles of waste (which thematically makes sense considering the origin of Chat Pile &#8216;s name), where all we can do is helplessly watch our shared reality dissolve away — with no relief in sight. &#8220;I feel like we all exist outside of reality,&#8221; Chat Pile&#8217;s lead singer Raygun Busch explains to me over Zoom.

In his first sit-down video interview since being released, Max B caught up with Billboard to talk about his influence, how he spent his time inside and his plans for the future. A couple of rappers who were influenced by Max are two widely popular ones out of Pittsburgh.

The Translate app may gain a persistent notification, allowing you to continue using Live Translate even if you switch to a different app. Google also appears to be prepping for Live Translate on XR glasses. In August, Google rolled out an update to the Translate app that introduced Live Translation. Powered by Gemini, this feature allows you to have a real-time back-and-forth conversation with others in a different language. Not only are your words converted into another language on screen, but you can also turn on audio playback to hear the translation spoken out loud. In our APK teardown of the Google Translate app, we discovered that several interesting changes are likely to be introduced to this Live Translate feature.

    "body": "TL;DR Google CEO Sundar Pichai says if AI bubble pops, “no company is going to be immune, including us.” Pichai compared AI boom to dot-com bubble of the 1990s, noting “elements of irrationality” in investment activity. Google parent company Alphabet’s stock price has doubled this year as Google has built out AI efforts. The breakneck pace of investment in companies developing AI tech over the past few years has many onlookers convinced we’re currently in an AI bubble. Sundar Pichai knows the situation is serious: when the AI bubble bursts, “no company is going to be immune,” the Google CEO told the BBC . In an interview with the BBC at Google’s headquarters in California, Pichai drew parallels between today’s AI market and the 1990s dot-com boom, during which investment in internet startups reached a fever pitch before a crash saw tech firms lose trillions in market cap and shed tens of thousands of jobs. Back then, “There was clearly a lot of excess investment,” Pichai said, “but none of us would question whether the internet was profound.” Pichai said AI investment is in a similar spot today.",

AYANEO hosted yet another livestream “sharing session” this morning, highlighting its upcoming Pocket VERT handheld.

In addition to unlabeled buttons and a minimalist D-pad, the Pocket VERT features a touchpad beneath its all-glass front. The touchpad extends across the width of the device, positioned in the space under both the D-pad and buttons. It’s programmable to serve as either the left joystick, the right joystick, or both.",

Gemini 3 Pro accurately analyzed complex charts I gave it, threw together easy-to-understand slideshows from dry text documents, and even created bespoke Android apps based on a short description of my requirements.",

If you want to go a step further, lock your phone away. The advice always sounds great until you actually try living with it. For one, my job relies on technology and communication, and I can’t exactly turn off the dial on that. Moreover, most of us cannot simply retreat from the world. We need maps, banking, authentication , messaging, and the small conveniences that make everyday life function smoothly. That tension between wanting less and needing enough is where most of these experiments fall apart. At least they do for me. You either give up too much or you fall right back into the same cycle of tapping and scrolling without even knowing it.",

    "body": "Credit: DJI TL;DR DJI has announced its new action camera, the Osmo Action 6, globally. The Osmo Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch square camera sensor, enabling flexible framing. The camera also adds a variable aperture for better portrait effects and closer zoom. DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",

I’ve carried these in backpacks through busy days, in my pockets while traveling, and in my rental car while driving around. After all was said and done, I learned a few lessons from my experience, like the fact that the advertised battery capacity of a power bank is almost double what you really get when you charge your phone, and that the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL don’t like older Qi chargers . They also still charge really, really slowly over Qi2 and Qi2.2.",

The OnePlus 15R is expected to be a rebadged version of the Ace 6, which was launched in China last month. OnePlus is also teasing a new smartwatch, which may be a rebadged OPPO Watch. Last week, OnePlus unveiled its latest top-tier phone, the OnePlus 15 , but skipped a crucial element. Over the past few years, the company’s flagships have been accompanied by less premium but more value-for-money flagship killers, denoted by an “R” suffix. Naturally, we were also expecting the OnePlus 15R at the event last week. However, OnePlus made no mention of the phone, besides briefly stating it would be “coming soon.” Fortunately, the company has now begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, which is likely to raise our expectations for a launch soon. OnePlus’ sites for the UK and India have already begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, showcasing a silhouette of the upcoming phone. In the teaser, it can be seen in two colors: dark gray and metallic green.

The recent rivalry began when AT&amp;T released an ad accusing T-Mobile of “Un-Truths,” allegedly misusing NAD materials in the process, which led to requests for a takedown of the ad, which AT&amp;T is aiming ot fight in court. The battle between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile continues, as the latter has released a new ad poking fun at AT&amp;T. The ad aired on live TV over the weekend, though T-Mobile provided us a copy (above).

Samsung Members is an app that offers a grab-bag of functionality to Galaxy device users, from support and diagnostics to “exclusive perks” like device discounts. The app also allows users to message each other — and that feature is currently being abused by scammers. A post by user GaryB82 on the US Samsung Community forums details the message that’s been circulating. In the scam, an account posing as an official Samsung channel says that the recipient’s account urgently needs “verification,” directing the user to click a link and supply personal info. Failure to comply, the message says, comes with a fine. It might go without saying, but if you’ve seen received of these messages, do not click the link.",

Outside the window, the aircraft is being readied for a high-altitude mission supporting the Geological Earth Mapping Experiment (GEMx) , a multi-year NASA–U.S. Geological Survey campaign to map critical mineral resources across the Western United States. The GEMx team believes that undiscovered deposits of at least some of the 50 mineral commodities deemed essential to U.S. national security, to the tech industry, and to clean energy exist domestically, and modern mineral maps will support exploration by the private sector. In 2025 alone, the ER-2 flew 36 science missions, collecting more than seven billion measurements over 200 flight hours, contributing to the largest airborne surface mineralogy dataset ever gathered in a single NASA campaign.

We’ve even heard through the grapevine that Android 17’s dessert codename is “ Cinnamon Bun ,” but without official confirmation, we couldn’t be sure. Fortunately, we’ve now found strong evidence confirming that “Cinnamon Bun” is indeed the internal moniker.

The same issue occurs with AirPods, which, despite using Bluetooth as the medium, lack basic app controls when connected to a non-Apple device, resulting in a severely limited experience. Thankfully, there’s an app that addresses the limitations when AirPods are paired to Android devices . While apps, such as OpenPods , already let you leverage some of the features, this newer app takes it several notches higher.

This would be significantly larger than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7’s 4,400mAh battery. We’d encourage you to take this leak with a big pinch of salt, though. We’ve known for a while now that Apple is working on an apparent iPhone Fold, which is set to take on the Galaxy Z Fold series. Now, a leaker has made a rather audacious claim about the Apple foldable’s battery capacity. Korean blogger Yeux1122 has claimed that Apple is testing a 5,400 to 5,800mAh battery in the iPhone Fold. The tipster claims that Apple might settle on the larger capacity at the expense of a thicker, heavier design.",

This two-part annual release schedule could predictably cause a reactionary split in Android flagship launches, with more premium models launching in the fall, and budget and value options launching in the coming spring. Ever since the iPhone 4S was launched in 2011, Apple has typically introduced its main phone lineup in September or October. Android smartphone manufacturers previously prioritized a flagship launch at events like MWC. However, over the years, it seemed that the entire industry had been inching closer to releasing the best new Android phones closer to Apple’s latest iPhone. This year, it’s the closest Android flagship SoCs have launched next to Apple’s SoC, and consequently, new Android flagships have arrived closer to the iPhone 17 series . Just as Android OEMs were about to settle into this rhythm, Apple seems to be on its way to run at a different pace. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

You can’t even stop it from downloading updates. The Kindle is designed to be a fully gated experience, and over time, that’s started to bother me.

I have a small collection of old Game Boy, SNES, and N64 titles collecting dust in the attic, and I’ve turned to emulation to enjoy them while keeping the aging cartridges out of the reach of curious toddlers. Unfortunately, emulation and a shortage of time don’t really go hand in hand. I can never remember which device I played a game on last, meaning I might have one save on my phone and another on my laptop. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve not even had the correct ROM saved on my tablet. And then there are nights I’d prefer to play on the TV. It can be challenging to maintain enough consistency to really get into some of my old favorites.",

Although I lived in Lebanon and had to pay to ship and import everything to me, while trying to reconcile between the abundance of US-made smart gadgets versus my EU wall plugs and 220-240V electricity, I figured a way around it.

In the nearly two years since its release, we’ve seen the company fold in T-Mobile Tuesdays, T-Mobile Money, and even many in-store services, which now rely heavily on the app. It’s become almost impossible to interact with T-Mobile representatives without having a phone running a working copy of T-Life. At launch, T-Mobile promised the consolidated experience would be an upgrade for customers, making it easier to manage services and perform account-level tasks without calling customer service or jumping through hoops. As we approach 2026, the question remains: Is T-Life really as bad as some think, or has it finally matured into something worth using?",
