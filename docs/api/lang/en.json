Yet there are still, inevitably, those who would prey upon this tenuous peace. Arc Raiders' would-be highwaymen might soon find themselves with more of a fight than they bargained for, however, as some players are making it their mission to punish anyone bringing the fight to their fellow man instead of the robot foe. Attention to all Top Side Sheriffs from r/ArcRaiders Over on the Arc Raiders subreddit , the highest-rated thread of the day is from redditor Zarniwoooop, who said he'd \"found the meaning of the raider's life\" as a self-appointed Topside Sheriff and called on others to join his vigilante effort. \"I jump in.

And, I suppose, some of you might also have your fingers crossed for Fallout: New Vegas 2. You probably shouldn't hold your breath waiting for it to happen, though. In an interview with The Game Business , Obsidian vice president of operations Marcus Morgan and vice president of development Justin Britch said they know lots of people want followups to the studio's greatest hits, but the developers who work there are more interested in doing other things. The hangup is that after years of making games based on other people's properties—KOTOR 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, Dungeon Siege 3, South Park: The Stick of Truth—Obsidian is apparently having a pretty good time doing its own thing. \"I know everyone on the internet, on every game we ever announce, will constantly reference back to, when’s the next New Vegas?

PC Gamer has verified that these text strings exist in the Discord API under the name \"MR test\" and will be giftable to other users just like profile decorations. While you can't actually buy any of them yet, each entry includes prices in USD that roughly match the amount of premium currency they're available for in the game. The Jeff the Land Shark's Halloween skin, for example, is listed for $20.49 and is about $22 worth of premium currency in-game.

That's what our quiz below is all about: I'm going to show you the names of some games with the punctuation removed, and you'll have to guess if they contain a colon, a dash, both, or neither. For simplicity's sake, I'm considering a hyphen a dash in this quiz (even though they're not the same thing), so if a game name has any kind of horizontal line in it, that counts! Since sometimes there's not universal agreement on how a game's name is punctuated across different sites (such as Steam and Wikipedia), I've gone to the publisher's website (when possible) for the definitive answer. Think you can remember if a game's title contains a colon, a dash (or hyphen), both, or neither? Give it your best shot, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers. Not all of it…",

    "body": "OneXPlayer has priced up its epic new OneXFly Apex handheld gaming PC . And the fun starts at a slightly mind-boggling $1,599 when configured with AMD's top Ryzen AI Max+ APU. Specifically, that's the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, the only version of AMD's Strix Halo mobile APU that's available with all 40 RDNA 3.5-spec graphics compute units available. And it's those 40 CUs, plus Strix Halo's exceptionally wide (for an APU) 256-bit bus, that make it so appealing, on paper, for gaming. But it also makes it expensive, as the new OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex amply proves. For the record, you can get the OneXFly Apex with Ryzen AI Max 385 starting at $1,399. But that has a downsized GPU with 32 CUs, significantly lessening the appeal of the device. Anyway, the \"base\" model with the top-tier 395 APU kicks off with a hefty 48 GB of memory. If that sounds like overkill, especially for a handheld, remember it's shared between the CPU and GPU. You also get a 1 TB SSD. The OneXFly Apex can be optioned up to 128 GB of memory and a 2 TB SSD. If you also go for the model with liquid cooling, you'll be looking at a mind-blowing price of $2,299. For a handheld. Bananas. As Andy explained previously , other hig…",

This issue has only gotten worse since the release of Redsec, where meeting some of these challenge requirements is even harder in the free-to-play.

This might seem like a colossally expensive thing to do, but when one of the aforementioned companies just happens to be Google, you know that the upfront cost probably isn't an issue. With the name Project Suncatcher , you'd be forgiven for thinking that Google is hoping to design a special solar panel system to power all of its data centers. Well, that's partially correct, but Project Suncatcher aims to use the power of the Sun by getting just a teeny bit closer to it, by putting the data centers in space. This isn't some whimsical fantasy; Google has seriously thought about all of this, as detailed in its research paper (PDF warning) on the project. The reason behind it all is that if you have satellites in a synchronous low Earth orbit, they're exposed almost continuously to sun…",

The tiniest time-slice can be the difference between virtual life and virtual death, so anything you can do to get bullets into braincases faster is likely to provide you an edge. Hence why CS2 lets players review their performance via demo playbacks. Yet because of the way the Internet works, what players see in a demo playback may not reflect the game they experienced with complete accuracy. As of Counter-Strike 2's latest update, however, players should find playbacks better representative of live matches. This is thanks to a new feature Valve introduced to the demo system named TrueView. \"With TrueView, demo playback will match the player's original experience much more closely,\" Valve writes in a Steam post . \"Previously demo playback showed the server's view of the world, without accounting for network latency.

That is, quite literally, a big short on Nvidia. Thanks to both the film and reality, Burry made his name foreseeing the sub-prime housing market collapse and World Financial Crisis it precipitated in 2008. Fair to say he has form when it comes to predicting financial catastrophe. According to Fortune , it seems Burry sees just such a calamity befalling Nvidia. His hedge fund, known as Scion Asset Management, has reportedly bought $1 billion in put options on Nvidia and another AI-adjacent company, Palantir. In really simple terms, put options give the holder the right to sell a company's stock at a fixed price in the future rather than the prevailing market price. In practice, put options are typically a device with which to bet against company, the idea being that if the price of the company goes down by the time the option matures, that gives you the opportunity, in effect, to buy the stock at the lower price and then resell at the h…",

If only this scourge could be repurposed into something more useful than, say, yet another Doom box in every sense. YouTuber Chris Doel has apparently overheard my environmentally themed wailing, having already created a number of projects that repurpose these power cells into fast-charging power banks and e-bike batteries. His latest build dials \"it up a couple of notches,\" creating something that not only generates enough energy to satisfy his power-hungry editing rig, but also powers his whole house using 500 disposable vapes . In between repeated pleas to absolutely not try this at home, charmingly creative problem-solving is out in full force throughout. For instance, when a lithium cell discharges below three volts, it can't really be recharged.

If you're anything like me, you've been lulled into the Mobility tree to become the Flash, only to realise that half the skills—mainly the later ones—don't work like you think they would based on what you're told in-game.

To get the good news out of the way, lots of the best skills in the Mobility tree are right at the start, like Marathon Runner and Youthful Lungs.

And while part of that's true, the recent spate of MMO news has me wondering if it's entirely our fault no new MMOs are coming out. Corporate wisdom (which is oftentimes an oxymoron) would have you believe that live services are the new moneymaker ( sure, if you hit it big , if you don't, you die) and that MMOs are unsustainable. To be fair to that wisdom, there are nuggets of truth in it. I don't mean to say that MMOs are a sure bet, far from it. MMOs are expensive, require constant maintenance, and competition is fierce because we don't like trying new stuff. But also, Amazon kinda messed New World up, and its shutdown is more about mismanagement than anything else. Contrary to hindsight, New World is not, on paper, a failed MMO.

It seems the variant we always wanted to see, which majors in graphics rather than CPU grunt, is set to be released. Chinese PC specialist SixUnited has a couple of new Ryzen AI Max models listed on its website (via Videocardz ), and indeed, a SixUnited tablet running one of the \"new\" APUs has popped up in the PassMark database . The most exciting model is the Ryzen AI Max+ 388. That combines eight CPU cores with the maximum 40 graphics compute unit count available from Strix Halo. Currently, the only way to get a version of Strix Halo with all 40 RDNA 3.5c CUs is to go with the very top Ryzen AI Max+ 395 model. That's a very expensive APU and comes with fully 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, which is arguably overkill for mobile gaming, especially within the confines of a handheld. In practice, Strix Halo has therefore thus far been of more interest as a tool for running local AI models on a limited budget than for gaming.

It's China's latest bid to break away from US-made tech, and follows news back in August that data centre operators were being instructed to source at least 50% of their chips from domestic manufacturers . Now, data centres that are less than 30% complete are being instructed to remove already installed chips if they're foreign-made. One facility in a northwestern province that planned to deploy Nvidia chips has allegedly already been suspended before even breaking ground as a result of the latest guidance. However, it's being decided on a case-by-case basis whether data centre projects at a more advanced stage can keep their foreign-made chips.

Ever-smaller transistors and ever-larger chips have made this possible, but with the physical limits of both impacting the growth of computing, new methods are required to continue the growth. One semiconductor research team claims to have achieved just that by stacking not chips or dies, but individual transistors. The work by the team at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia was published in Nature Electronics (via El País ), and as is always the case for such academic research, it's all very complicated. Basically, though, it comes down to the idea that chip makers are looking to go up , rather than using smaller transistors or wider dies, to keep Moore's 'law' alive. Processors such as AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilise hybrid bonding techniques to stack dies on top of each other, to increase the number of transistors in the whole package, so there's more cache. All SSDs today rely on multi-layer NAND flash memory to improve capacity, performance, and reliability. However, none of these methods f…",

But the bugs piling higher than a locust swarm in a grain silo threatened to undermine the game's foundations. The first batch of bugfixes landed with immediate effect, addressing issues like deformed pets and vanishing ghost children. Slightly later than planned, the second QoL patch has now arrived, fixing more than 150 problems raised by the community on the EA forums and social media. As with any systems-heavy game, The Sims 4's complex web of interactions often produces patch notes that read more like a comedy script than an actual changelog, and this latest update includes some classics of the genre. For example, EA has tweaked \"relationship decay\" on couples who have a baby because it was \"too fast and destroying relationships\" (which frankly sounds realistic to me) while Sims have also been instructed to put items lik…",

Now, Bethesda would like you to know it's gearing up to break your mods once more, but at least it's a limited subset of them this time. With Fallout 4's 10th-anniversary edition gearing up for launch in the next week, the studio's warned players that it's going to break any main menu mods they might have come November 10, presumably because Todd Howard just gets a sick thrill from it. Or, well, possibly also because FO4's anniversary version will entail changes to the game's main menu, and so mods based on futzing about with the original version of that main menu will encounter stuff they don't anticipate in the new version and spark out like a robot fed a logic problem.

Remember, these numbers are for the third quarter of 2025, alone. But from a PC Gaming perspective, the really good news is that the figures weren't all about selling AI chips to the likes of OpenAI. Sure, AMD's data centre revenue was up 22% year-over-year to a record $4.3 billion, making it the largest single contributor. But combined client and gaming revenue increased even more, up 73% year-over-year to $4 billion. In other words, AMD is still pulling in almost as much cash from PC processors and graphics chips as it does from servers and AI clients. \"Our PC processor business is performing exceptionally well with record quarterly sales as the strong demand environment and breadth of our leadership Ryzen portfolio accelerates growth,\" Su says.

Anyway—it's really nice to see Bailey continue to meet with success. He was getting work beforehand, mind, but his international stardom's grown exponentially since 2020. Which I have to admit is probably due to him starring in Bridgerton and not because he voiced my favourite scion. He also starred in 2024's Wicked movie, which is based on a musical you might've heard of. I'm confident his new appellation won't go to his head, though.

    "body": "While this isn't exactly PC gaming news, Apple recently launched a new interface for its app store when viewed in a browser. Specifically, it makes the whole shebang work just like the Apps… err… app. Still, while it looks and works as intended, Apple's web developers forgot to do something important before making it live: disabling the sourcemaps. This meant that someone was able to archive the source code for the site's entire frontend and stick it on GitHub (via Ruri on X ). Now, I can't imagine it won't be long before this all disappears, but like AMD's accidental leak of the source code for FSR 4 , once it's out on the Internet, it'll be there for good. Apple used Svelte, but forgot to remove the sourcemap 🤣 https://t.co/AfsTX2zCFR pic.twitter.com/DhWkfDEkA6 November 3, 2025 If you're wondering just what a sourcemap is and what the big deal is about disabling them, let me explain: Today's websites and web apps are complex affairs, and professional developers will often use a range of high-level tools to create the code for them. However, browsers work on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. So, the original code (i.e. the source code) needs to be transpiled for browsers, and for the …",

    "body": "In early 2024, Turtle Beach bought gamepad and peripherals company PDP for $118 million. Just before that happened, PDP released the Victrix Pro BFG. It was a pro gamepad with some neat customization features: The left stick and the D-Pad, and the right stick and the face buttons, both lived on modules which could be removed and reversed to toggle between symmetrical and asymmetrical analog stick layouts. A fightpad module was included too, so you could swap out either the left or right modules for some tactile six-button action. I'm describing this older model in such detail because this newer Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded (now labelled 'by Turtle Beach') is functionally identical to that older PC controller . There are some minor changes once you scratch the surface, but before I get to those, let's re-iterate what carries forward. Like its predecessor, the Victrix Pro Reloaded has the nowadays essential \"pro\" features, including four programmable paddle buttons, trigger stops on the L2 / R2 switches, and Hall effect analog sticks. Three d-pad variations are included, which accommodate both Xbox and Switch Pro variations, as well as a hybrid of both, and these can be popped in and ou…",

Arc Raiders has a bunch of random crap for you to collect, from toasters and alarm clocks to cat beds, olives, scrap metal, and so on. Of course, there are also guns and other, more combat-focused items to loot, too. It's a lot to juggle, admittedly, but Arc Raiders has two features more extraction games need: detailed item cards and an optional auto-unloading backpack. Each item, no matter how flashy or mundane, will have a description that tells you not only what it is and what it's used for, but also roughly where to find it. There are a few outliers with inaccurate or misleading descriptions, but for the most part, you know exactly what each item can do for you. Hell, some even clue you in on cool interactions, like throwing fireball burners as if they were grenades, or using fabric as a makeshift bandage, so it pays to read, folks. It helps that there aren't actually any completely useless items in Arc Raiders to begin with, as everyt…",

Having spent enough time with the console to create an alarmingly accurate mould of the DualSense controller with nothing but my palm prints, I think I'm qualified in saying this: the PS5 is a bit chunky, innit? YouTube maker channel Not From Concentrate apparently shares this sentiment, having shrunk the standard, bulky console into a comparatively svelte 6-litre chassis (via Videocardz ). While the base version of the PlayStation 5 is a comparatively chunkier 10.4 litres, the slim—with the detachable disc drive that looks kinda like a zit to me—is only about 7 and a half litres. So, yes, you do lose those eye-catchingly swoopey white wings but you do gain back a whole lot of space around your TV. This isn't Not From Concentrate's first attempt at a tiny PS5 build , but this latest project features support for full size M.2 form factor SSDs, and enjoys a much bigger potential storage capacity for all of your games as a result. Not only that, but this itty bitty take runs even cooler and draws less power than a standard PS5 too. Du…",

(It probably also helped that I was no longer 13 years old.) But something was lost when RPGs became blockbusters rather than adaptations of pen-and-paper games, and The Outer Worlds 2 game director Brandon Adler is happy to see RPGs like Baldur's Gate 3 force players to pay more attention to their build choices and the game world. \"In general, it feels like many games, but RPGs in particular, are like, 'Well, you're not allowed to make bad choices, so every character build is viable, and we make sure that no matter what you do, everything's going to be fine,'\" Adler told GamesRadar+ in a recent interview. \"And you know, the problem with that, at least in my opinion, is that for those choices to matter, they have to be things that could be good or bad, depending on what you're doing.\" Adler recounted watching streamers make…",

A big question that has come up as the game transforms yet again, is how often this is going to happen, and if it will continue for the foreseeable future. Speaking in an interview with Diablo streamer Raxxanterax , associate game director Zaven Haroutunian touched on this concern. \"The intention is not to replace everything just because we can,\" he said. Instead, the team tries to get a \"holistic picture of the whole game,\" and look at \"what is not pulling its weight, what is not helping support the player experience in a positive way.\" Haroutunian says monster types were one of the things that went untouched since the game launched and that they needed to be redone before a dungeon with leaderboards could be added. The Tower dungeon coming in the next season relies on the new monster types to gauge your completion progress, encouraging you to seek out tougher enemies for more points—something that just wouldn't work wit…",

Blueprints are one of the rarest drops in Arc Raiders , as they unlock the ability to craft weapons permanently instead of waiting for them to show up in the shop. The Anvil is a great blueprint to secure early on thanks to the gun's high damage and its Arc armor-penetrating heavy ammo. It's like carrying a pocket Ferro that you don't have to reload after every shot. Because blueprint spawns are somewhat random, there's no surefire place to get an Anvil blueprint. There are, however, raider containers that have a high chance of containing weapon blueprints. Thanks to the investigative work of the community, these caches can be tracked down with consistency. Where I found the Anvil blueprint I found the Anvil blueprint in a convenient hidey hole on Dam Battlegrounds that seems to always spawn raider containers. The raider cache spawns in a gap under where the raised highway on Dam Battlegrounds ends. The spot is between Raider Outpost East and East Broken Bridge.
