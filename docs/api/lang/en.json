Mists of Pandaria Remix had some hiccups early on, but Blizzard was quick to fix them and let players have their fun for the duration of the event. But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff. Blizzard quickly issued a response , saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing. Sure enough, the next PTR had a long list of changes that essentially removed all of the gear …",

There, they were met with the Rupture strain: new varieties of burrowing bug enemies that proved to be an immediate source of controversy by mercilessly kicking people's asses. Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts . While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons. Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for everyone else. You'll be shocked to learn, I'm sure, that players didn't receive this news well . Evidently, even with the Rupture Warrior lethality …",

A new map and quests for a two year-old game, and no charge? Such largesse is only possible thanks to the involvement of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has made many gaming investments as part of its mission to detoxify the image of the brutal petrol state. The DLC will see Basim, Mirage's protagonist, visiting AlUla, an ancient city key to Saudi Arabian culture. It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup. \"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site. As to the question of whether the DLC is being fully funded by the PIF, Ubisoft says it does \"not comment on rumours.\" It appears that Ubisoft staff are not particularly happy about the publisher getting into bed with the Saudis.

Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range—which looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set. Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree. Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Logitech) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Logitech) The wheelbase itself will be available as a standalone unit starting at $350/€300, and comes with full TrueForce support, which uses game data in combination with audio to approximate some of the details that other direct drive wheels can miss, like engine rumble and precise kerb simula…",

    "body": "Low-profile rapid trigger keyboards are a bit of a niche on a niche, but given faster actuation and less key travel, it makes sense why someone more competitively minded may want to pick one up. Well, Logitech has you covered; it'll just cost you $170. Will that be cash or card? Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t…",

The Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike lets you adjust the mouse click's actuation point or enable rapid trigger, just like you can on a Hall effect or optical keyboard. The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation. This is what Logitech is claiming to have solved thanks to its \"Superstrike\" technology which is a \"combination of inductive analogue sensing and real-t…",

Decisions have been made to ditch 128-player matches from Battlefield 2042 , and the devs have been listening to players complaining about underpowered vehicles and teeny-tiny maps to improve on what they already have. But the lesson learnt from Battlefield 4 was: sometimes less destruction is more. (Image credit: EA) But even so, the decision was made to scale back on the all-out map demolition in the form of Levolution events, which were present in Battlefield 4, as the devs wanted to ensure that any map destruction in Battlefield 6 would \"serve a gameplay purpose.\" Instead, the choice was made to come up with a new feature called \"tactical destruction\". \"We want people to be flanking by destroying things, to take down a building to eliminate an enemy,\" Grass continues. \"If you could destroy everything, once there's nothing left, then the game wouldn't be fun.\" All the Levolution events could be pure chaos when triggered.

The closest I've ever got was when I rinsed through Borderlands 3's DLCs (many of which were shockingly good ), and even then, that was more coincidental. I'd simply run out of levels, so I was technically in the postgame. But I've never tried to get a build going, farm that all-important legendary, or so much as sneezed at a raid boss.

I wouldn't blame you for being skeptical, but the result looks more promising than it sounds. (Image credit: Bonfire Studios) Arkheron is set in a \"dark, surreal world,\" where teams of amnesiac souls battle in a purgatorial afterlife to ascend an ever-shifting tower built from the memories of the dead. Teams enter the tower, gain abilities from memory-haunted weapons and equipment, and compete to climb higher before the current floor is destroyed until one team eventually stands triumphant at the tower's apex. At first glance, Arkheron's isometric perspective and hellish environs loudly ring a Diablo-esque bell.

So, maybe what's needed isn't replacement but reform, and maybe that should be in the form of SHRINK . That's not a new proposal—the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) paper is dated June 2015, coming out of the 42nd annual symposium—but it might be new to you. It was to me. It was brought to my attention by LaurieWired on X , who points out that just 12 of the 1,000+ mnemonics (instructions) on modern CPUs make up 89% of compiled C/C++ code . And even if we don't go down the C/C++ route (as some suggest that this might not cover all instruction bases), the SHRINK research paper shows there are lots of unused instructions over time accounting for all bases: \"We consider instructions that belong to vector extensions in separate categories [than unused], because albeit unused, they are still under adoption and their UISes are likely to be used in the future.\" The apparent over-abundance of instruc…",

When designing the Collector, it was important to the dev team that it would be \"distinct from Leviathans in our previous Subnautica games,\" Cory Strader, the visual development lead, explains in the dev diary. \"We started with multiple rounds of quick, low-detail thumbnail sketches, exploring a wide range of shapes and silhouettes.

That's still probably true—Battlefield 6 is following Call of Duty's model so closely that it's got the same gunsmith system, the same small-scale modes, and the same battle royale spinoff in the works—but Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm are the best evidence yet that this is still Battlefield to the core.

Apparently, FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology is \"converted\" into compute Shader code. \"This means that FSR Redstone's neural rendering core can also run on GPUs made by other companies,\" Hall said (via machine translation). In other words, it doesn't require AI or matrix math cores, just as Nvidia's DLSS technology requires Tensor cores. It can run on conventional GPU shaders. \"ML2CODE-based frameworks, such as FSR Redstone, can be seamlessly integrated directly into DirectX or Vulkan graphics pipelines with minimal latency.

However, you can't farm it right away. If you haven't been doing side content, then you've likely glossed over what you need to do without even realising it.

Let me read that a few more times to see if I can figure out what it means. Nope, no luck. Okay, let me try to break it down for myself.

But over the last few years I've played a lot of different Vampire Survivors imitators, and all the way through DRG:S's run in early access, I think it's been the king of the pack.

They booted up Doom on an old PDA, expecting it to crash at some point. That's because every time the game demo would run and then reset, the engine would store a new variable. Then it'd start up again, and again store a new variable. All in one long string until, blam-o, it'd crash due to an overflow—the data exceeding the possible bounds of the value used to store it. Though how long it'd take to crash was all theoretical, until it wasn't. Minki ran a physical test on an old PDA—you don't need much to run Doom, as proven by that time someone played it in a PDF file , or a badge for a hacking conference , or even on its own box .

Atrocious mids, swampy highs, lows with the callous insouciance of a neglectful husband*. I refuse to subject my ears to that. Well, now I won't have to, and my CS2 career can finally bloom. In an update earlier today, Valve announced that the game's 'nades are almost irresponsibly hi-fi. They \"now have unique higher-fidelity sounds for draw, inspect, pin-pull, and throw.\" Our long national nightmare is over. Also, other things, but I fail to see how they compare in significance to our new crystalline 'nades. Most promising, I think, is the addition of cs_script, \"a JavaScript based scripting system for Counter-Strike maps\" that can now be used by community mapmakers. This opens the door to a whole bunch of buckwild possibilities, like community-made custom CS2 game modes (you can see an example of the scripting language in action in this X post from Gabe Follower ).

But there's one character we all severely underestimated, Amon. Looking at his skill trees, he's a bit…bland compared to the other characters , and after picking him as my main Vault Hunter, it's not far from the truth. He's generally quite clunky and just doesn't have as many broken perks as the other characters. Well, it turns out that Amon is secretly the most busted character of the bunch (and that's saying something), thanks to a potentially unintended interaction between the Berserk and There Is Only Death perks, and the Groundbreaker specialisation. The kicker is that all you need to do is punch. The goal is to stack as much bonus damage as possible from Berserk (cryo) and Groundbreaker (kinetic). You might question how we benefit from Groundbreaker, since it only triggers on non-melee damage, but the bonus cryo damage applied to melee from Berserk actually does the trick. So, every time you punch, you deal increased damage and infinitely stack even more bonus damage for the next punch. M…",

If you were hoping for some more boss nerfs or perhaps fewer obstacles on the way to bosses, then give up all hope ye who enter here. No, the latest Silksong patch—which is currently live in the public-beta branch on Steam, but will roll out officially in the coming days—is mostly about making sure the bosses themselves don't keep making dumb mistakes.

That can't be right, I thought. That would be such a fundamental bug that it would effectively break the game. Anyway, I loaded in, did some testing, and you can probably guess where this is going. We are investigating an issue where players are unable to respawn in Solo Ops activities after dying. We are attempting to solve this issue as soon as we're able. More information will be provided when available. September 16, 2025 From my own experience, once you die the respawn button will appear after the usual countdown, but cannot be interacted with. In order to start playing again you either need to go to orbit (ie, leave the activity) or switch characters. Which is as big a problem as it sounds.

This will be most exciting if you don't own Escape from Tarkov yet and have been holding out for this very moment. If you already own it and want to play it through Steam, though, you'll need to buy it again and link your Steam account to your existing Tarkov profile, Battlestate confirmed in a blog post. It's all on the same servers so you won't have to buy the Steam version to play with Steam players, and you've always had the option of adding Tarkov as a non-Steam game to your library if all you want is the ease of access and the overlay. But all the other big features—friend list synchronization, Steam achievements, lifelong playtime tracking—will be exclusive to those who buy it through the platform. It also means players with thousands of hours sunk in will only be able to leave a review on the new storefront if they buy the game again. If you…",

Bloody fistfights, car chases, a diving tackle through a window—all to unravel a mystery that hits awful close to home for our grizzled protagonist. \"Sam Fisher is back and this time, the mission is personal.\" Again! It hits all the narrative and aesthetic beats I expect out of a modern spy thriller, and through that lens, I think it looks pretty neat. There's a mysterious wristwatch with coveted blueprints inside it somehow and yes, they plug it into a giant wall of green monitors, and yes, I eat that kind of thing up. But short of a few referential nods, I think the trailer is sadly a little light on Splinter Cell vibes specifically. It's a lot of action and energy for largely methodical, unhurried stealth games. My favorite moments in Splinter Cell never involved big fist fights or car chases, they involved silently panicking as guards circled me hiding in the one safe shadow in a patrol-filled room. Guns and brawls were a sign things had gone wrong, and I was most elated when the only enemies that ever saw me ended up unconscious in a crate somewhere. Okay, maybe that wouldn't make …",

In season 10, or the Season of Infernal Chaos , the best loot in the game can drop as \"Chaos armor\", allowing you to use items in ways you never could before. Several Unique items and their powerful guaranteed stats will have new Chaos variants that are even more powerful than normal and can be equipped in new slots on your character. The idea is that a Unique that could only drop as gloves before can now show up as a pair of boots or some other piece, which opens up all kinds of combinations and new builds. \"A lot of us in the office are fans of card games, and what you do in card gaming is you typically build a deck from a bunch of different cards,\" game designer Aislyn Hall explained when asked about the inspiration for Chaos Armor on the stream. \"When I'm building my character in an ARPG, or a Diablo, I think about it in the same lens.\" Diablo 4 seasons have never felt this experimental.

One of the developers heavily affected was Zenimax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO), which saw the cancellation of an MMO codenamed Blackbird alongside an unspecified number of layoffs. Such was the impact of the latter that, despite not being included in the initial round of cuts, long-serving ZeniMax president Matt Firor fell on his sword after 18 years as studio head. \"He wore a lot of different hats,\" says Rich Lambert, the new studio game director at Zenimax, in a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz . Firor's responsibilities have been split across Lambert and new studio head Jo Burba, who's \"focused on the operational side of things, and I'm focused on a lot of studio-level things and future planning.\" Some would speculate the layoffs are what lies behind Firor's departure and, while Lambert doesn't confirm this, he make…",

That's where the best XP farms come in, netting you heaps of experience to level up fast and with less effort, so you can focus on your favourite bits. If it's your first run through the campaign, I'd generally recommend just completing the story and exploring the open world—there's little reason to grind before then. Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters . Best Borderlands 4 XP farms The two best ways to farm XP in Borderlands 4 are to complete bounty contracts and grind drill site activities , with the latter being even better when you're playing in co-op.
