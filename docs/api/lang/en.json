Backed by a choir dressed in Italy&#8217;s flag colors, Pausini — wearing an elegant black open-shoulder gown — delivered an emotional performance that set the tone for the global event, celebrating Italy’s rich history. The anthem was written by Goffredo Mameli in the 1800s, serving as a powerful reminder of Italy&#8217;s fight for unity and independence.

I’m also familiar with the business model it employs to encourage members to pay for the premium version, which is probably easier to justify mentally if it’s seen as benefiting your health — I do the same rationalizing with my Duolingo subscription . We were keen to find out whether you pay for Strava, so we ran a poll among our readers. I was quite surprised by the percentage of you who actually do. That poll was prompted by an opinion piece from my colleague Ryan Haines, who explained why Strava went from his favorite running app to something he now barely tolerates. After years as a paying subscriber, he argued that Strava has become far too aggressive about locking away personal data and other features unless you cough up for Premium. For him, the fun and freedom that originally made Strava appealing have eroded to the point that he’s now treating it less like a training tool and more like a glorified kudos machine.",

The Galaxy Z Fold 7 was one of the biggest success stories of 2025, and companies aren’t letting up with Samsung and HUAWEI already chasing down the tri-fold market. But it still feels like foldables are partly experimental, or at least a bit of a niche category. They’re very expensive, they’re still relatively fragile, and they’re not the most practical phone to use day-to-day. If you’re curious about them but you’re not willing to commit, I stumbled on the best way for you to experiment with foldables without breaking the bank. How? A new Pixel Fold costs $560 now on Amazon , or $420 renewed, and it’s the best deal in mobile tech these days. I say this with certainty because I have one and I’ve been using it for a week to see how it holds up and how it compares to newer foldables.",

The record follows 2018’s Honey and represents her first full-length release in eight years. Robyn recently previewed the project with singles “Talk To Me” and “Sexistential,” following earlier track “Dopamine.” In announcing the album last month, she described its emotional tone as a return inward after years of exploration. “It’s like a spaceship coming through the atmosphere at a really high speed and crash landing,” she said in a statement. “That’s how I felt — like I’d been searching too far out into space, and now I’m crashing back into myself.” Known for pairing club-ready production …",

One area where it clearly shone was its impressive battery life. Meanwhile, Samsung has also faced the same criticism but remains in limbo with the same cameras and battery packs, especially on the Ultra, for nearly four generations. With the Galaxy S26 Ultra, the inertia could be more damaging, especially as Apple could surpass the Ultra.

    "body": "Credit: X / Evan Blass TL;DR The Galaxy S26 Ultra has leaked yet again, this time in a video that shows it spinning 360º. The video shows the design from different angles and reveals the new camera bump. We also see a body-colored S Pen in Cobalt Violet. With just a few weeks to the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series, we’re now approaching the point of marketing material leaking out. After a seemingly official poster emerged earlier in the week, followed by a short-lived listing with multiple colors on a low-profile e-commerce website, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is cropping up again, this time in a bold 360º video. The latest Galaxy S26 Ultra leak comes from leaker Evan Blass on X and flaunts the phone’s different side profiles in Cobalt Violet color. This is also perhaps the clearest, highest-quality leak for the Galaxy S26 series, so much so that it looks like Blass snagged it directly from the top marketing teams at Samsung headquarters.",

These products include programmable buttons, smart plugs, smart lights, and sensors. While these devices should work seamlessly with any smart home platform, that hasn’t been the case for some users.

The toggle would allow emoji to grow right along with the text. Even if we sometimes feel a little burnt out on them, it’s hard to deny the fundamental appeal of emoji . Including just the right one brightens up a dull text, or even helps convey some emotional subtlety that might have otherwise gone missed. But in order to get the most out of emoji, we need to be able to clearly see them, and it looks like Google’s working on a change in Gboard that could soon help out with just that.

An Experience More with Appreciation Savings plan lowers monthly pricing while also reducing trade-in credits. The Loyalty plan is cheaper for large accounts, but cuts data, perks, and long-term price guarantees. T-Mobile isn’t making a big song and dance about it, but it has started offering two new plans designed to keep existing customers from drifting away . The catch is that neither plan is universally available, and because they aren’t advertised, you may not even know they exist unless you ask. Even then, it isn’t clear if they’ll be revealed. As The Mobile Report reports, citing internal T-Mobile sources, the new plans began rolling out today and are limited to certain “segmented” accounts selected by T-Mobile using undisclosed criteria. In short, it sounds like availability depends on who you are, how long you’ve been with T-Mobile, and maybe even which department you end up talking to. The image below shows how these two new plans compare to the standard ones.",

Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26.
