Now, it turns out that the latest beta update brings a useful slider to the camera app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

As part of its efforts to bring Android to PCs with ‘ Aluminium OS ,’ Google has been steadily improving how the operating system handles input peripherals, app windowing, and external displays. This includes both big changes that the majority of users expect from desktop OSes as well as smaller tweaks that only a fraction of users will appreciate. With the release of Android 16 in June, for example, Google updated the screen recorder dialog to allow you to select external displays, enabling you to record activity on them.

Google Meet can now share your system audio, allowing meeting participants to hear sound from any app or source on your computer. Google Meet is a free and simple video conferencing program, but it’s not without limitations. The software supports sharing Google Chrome tabs, system windows, and even the presenter’s entire screen to create a collaborative experience with meeting participants. However, Google Meet was historically less versatile when it came to sharing system audio. In an update, Google is tweaking Meet to handle audio sharing better, adding support for sharing device audio with the group. While presenting a specific app window or your computer’s entire screen, Meet can now share your device’s complete system audio with meeting participants. This makes it possible for users to play audio from an app that’s running in the background during a Meet call. Before the change, Google Meet users had to present a specific tab to share audio from a site with the group.",

Today, however, you wouldn’t be so disconnected thanks to satellite connectivity , a feature that links your phone directly to satellites orbiting Earth. Google introduced platform support for satellite connectivity in last year’s Android release, though the feature was initially limited to emergency messaging. The technology has advanced significantly since then, however, paving the way for features like WhatsApp calling and live location sharing even without cellular coverage.",

The deal reflects Verizon’s rent-instead-of-own strategy, following its exit from tower ownership last year, which has become the industry norm for all major US carriers. Network improvements are likely to be real but fairly incremental, with limited short-term impact for most users. Earlier this year, T-Mobile formally acquired US Cellular’s customer base , retail footprint, and some of its spectrum in the process. That said, the company behind US Mobile continues as Array. Going forward, Array’s core business is to license its massive collection of former US Cellular towers to other companies, with T-Mobile signing a deal in May to use over 2,000 of them to boost its own coverage. Now it seems Verizon is making a deal of its own , committing to the use of over 4,400 new towers in the deal. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The new OnePlus 15R tries to keep that streak going, playing to OnePlus’s strengths of performance and battery life while costing less than its flagship sibling, the OnePlus 15. But with a fan-favorite feature gone, OnePlus’ software heading in the wrong direction, and areas like camera quality and wireless charging being left on the back burner, it makes this year’s OnePlus R phone a much less attractive option — especially with another price increase that pushes it all the way up to $700.",

Available globally from today, it gives advanced users a way to host Homey locally on devices like a Raspberry Pi, NAS , or small home server, rather than relying on dedicated Homey hardware or cloud-only control.

When you want to share something on your screen but don’t want to — or can’t — get a link to the content, you can just take a screenshot . If what you’re trying to capture is too long to fit on screen, you can take a scrolling screenshot to capture more than what the display shows.

If Samsung has picked up on this vibe, it must be setting off some alarm bells at HQ. That backdrop is what led us to ask you a blunt question about your expectations in a recent opinion piece by my colleague Rita. Specifically, we wanted to know if you think that the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will underperform their competitors in 2026. For her part, Rita argued that Samsung’s smaller flagships look set to lag behind rivals on specs, value, and ambition, even if they still sell well.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google is swapping the search UI on Pixel phones with a more generic one. It now uses the same search interface as on every other Android device. Google says the change enables quicker access to AI Mode. For a long time, the unique search interface has been a characteristic part of the Pixel experience. Instead of launching the Google app, as it does on other Android devices, tapping the search bar on Pixel phones has traditionally opened a unique search overlay that also enables searching for apps, local files, and contacts, and offers a shortcut to search the web in a relatively modern interface. Unfortunately, if you liked that interface, you’d be disheartened to know it is going away. Instead of the unique interface, Google is replacing it with the search screen we’re used to seeing on other non-Pixel devices.",

A new “Share network” toggle in Wi-Fi settings will let you decide if other users can automatically access a specific network without re-entering the password. Although currently in the Canary channel, this feature is expected to arrive in a future Android update, possibly the Android 16 QPR3 beta. Android allows you to create different user profiles, each with its own apps, files, and settings, enabling multiple people to share a single device. Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network?

If you’ve been waiting patiently to upgrade your phone in 2026, hoping the next generation of devices will be faster, cheaper, or offer better value, we’ve got some bad news for you. Smartphones will most likely get more expensive and less featureful in the coming year compared to what you can buy today.",

Battery life is typically okay for us on Google’s latest, but depending on the workload, Pixel 10 phones sometimes offer shorter battery life than last year’s Pixel 9 series did. Stranger still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in particular can be annoyingly inconsistent. Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

Now, an update to the Apple TV app for Android adds Google Cast support for casting to smart TVs and displays. The Apple TV app’s Google Cast implementation includes a miniplayer and full-screen UI while streaming. Apple TV is becoming a popular streaming service outside of the Apple ecosystem, with viral hits like Severance, Pluribus, and Ted Lasso. The streaming platform finally earned its own Android app in February, allowing Android users to subscribe to Apple TV or the MLS Season Pass on their smartphone via Google Play Billing. While the Android app supported many of the same features as its iOS counterpart, it was missing one thing: Google Cast support. Now, that’s changing, with version 2.2 of the Apple TV app for Android adding Google Cast support. It’s rolling out now on the Google Play Store , making it easy for users to cast Apple TV shows to their favorite smart TVs and displays. There’s a persistent Cast button beside the Apple TV account bubble on the app’s homepage. A quick tap reveals Google Cast displays nearby, including any Nest Hubs…",

User Gaiden206 posted screenshots of the new experiment on the r/pixel_phones subreddit. Called “Tailor your feed,” the experiment lets you tell the Google app specifically the type of content you do or don’t want to see in Discover, with flexibility to add or remove topics, or narrow the focus of a type of content you’re already seeing.
