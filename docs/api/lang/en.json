A PR representative for the company has confirmed that the feature is currently unavailable for users in these states. The reason could be due to the biometric data laws in Texas and Illinois. When Google launched the Pixel 10 series, it also debuted a conversational editing feature for the Photos app. Conversational editing is a Gemini-powered feature that allows you to edit images simply by entering a text or voice prompt. Last month, Google expanded the feature so other Android users in the US could begin trying it out. Although it’s now available on more Android devices, it’s still missing for users in two states.

Twenty-five years since the song’s Oct. 27, 2000, release, “One More Day” has been heard more than 5.5 million times on the radio, according to BMI, putting it in league with such titles as The Beatles’ “Penny Lane,” Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5,” Eric Clapton’s “Tears in Heaven” and Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On.” Diamond Rio has never been a band that commands constant media attention, so “One More Day” reached that level through a workman-like route, finding its place in people’s lives through its utilitarian value: the harmony-drenched chorus has ideal sing-along qualities, it’s an attractive wedding song and even more suited for funerals. The song – and the band – stealthily established a place in culture by assisting people through big personal moments, both in solitude and with company. “I can never explain it exactly,” Diamond Rio frontman Marty Ro…",

    "body": "New York has always worn its attitude on its sleeve and on its sneakers. From the stoops of Brooklyn to the runways of SoHo, fashion in the city isn’t just about what you wear, it’s about what you represent. It’s identity, legacy and rebellion stitched together. That same spirit drives the new adidas Originals x Avirex collaboration, a reimagined Superstar that bridges heritage and the next generation of New York energy. And at the center of it all is Joey Bada$$, the Brooklyn-born rapper, actor, and cultural voice who’s spent his career embodying what it means to move with authenticity. Adidas x Avirex Courtesy of Adidas To New Yorkers, clothing is more than fabric, it’s communication. The city’s fashion language was built on individuality: from uptown sneaker culture to downtown leather jackets, each borough carved its own chapter into global style. Joey Bada$$, who’s nearly 15 years deep into his career, has lived that narrative in real time. “I think it represents alignment, especially in the spirit of NYC,” he says of the collaboration. “Here’s three brands that represent New York City culture in its most original, authentic forms.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile is reportedly running a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer (Promo R339) that began on October 2 and includes many older Android and iPhone models. The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn’t listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer.",

Fortunately, the open nature of Android allows OEMs like OnePlus to add their own changes on top of Google’s releases. That’s exactly what OnePlus has done with its latest OxygenOS 16 update. It not only brings many of Android 16’s key features to OnePlus phones but also adds a host of additional features to improve your productivity, touch up your photos, make your phone feel faster, and more. Here’s everything new in OxygenOS 16! A new look and feel for OnePlus phones in OxygenOS 16 The biggest change in OxygenOS 16 is the new design. While not as extensive as Google’s Material 3 Expressive overhaul in Android 16, OxygenOS 16 is still a significant refresh. OnePlus divided the design changes into two categories: “Breathe With You” for visual refinements and “Thrive with Free Expression” for new customization options.",

It features TMR sticks, analog triggers, gyro controls, flip-out handles, an optional dock for external displays, and more. Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

Shockingly, mere five months after its launch, reports suggest that Samsung has killed the Edge line . That means no further production of the Galaxy S25 Edge beyond existing stock, and no plans to launch its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge. One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August. Even the lowest-selling S25 Plus sold many times more than the Edge, but with the advantage of having launched earlier in the year.",

In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design. At the same time, certain outliers, like Nothing, challenge that notion by experimenting with unusual camera designs , secondary displays , and unusually tiny screens . Now, another leading Android manufacturer is experimenting with a subtle change that can radically alter the phone’s look by altering how the camera appears.

The smartphone is now available for pre-order in the US and will cost $999 when it launches early next year. It packs a 5,000mAh battery, a triple-rear camera setup, 16GB of RAM, and a MediaTek chipset. There’s a lot of talk about de-Googling these days. The movement essentially advocates cutting Google’s access to private information on people’s devices. That’s why many privacy-focused operating systems, like GrapheneOS , are gaining traction among users who want to avoid Google’s tracking and data collection and protect their information from reaching the wrong hands. Now, a new smartphone called the HIROH Phone is promising all those things, and it even adds a hardware kill switch for extra peace of mind.",

There’s a lot of potential ways that apps can use the Live Updates feature, but unfortunately, developers had to wait a bit to actually use it.

Various glitches and broken routines have tested people’s patience, even among those who’ve stuck by the platform from the start. Google’s hoping its big Gemini for Home upgrade and new hardware will turn things around, but after so many false starts, we wanted to know if people are willing to wait around for that revival. We polled our readers to find out. My colleague Karandeep Singh expressed his personal views on this recently, making his article the perfect place to run our poll. For his part, he admitted his loyalty to Google Home had finally run out. He explained how years of reliability issues and patchy updates had worn him down, and how learning that Gemini for Home won’t launch in India anytime soon was the final straw. Understandable as that is, his geospecific issue won’t apply to many of our readers, and the poll results below suggest that a majority of you are willing to roll the dice with Google’s smart home ecosystem at least one more time.",

Privacy is a big concern for a lot of smartphone users, and while platforms like Android offer oodles of different settings for managing your data and who gets access to it , at the end of the day you’re still placing your trust in Google. You’ve got other options, though, with projects like GrapheneOS offering alternative firmware that doubles down on privacy while further minimizing your data’s exposure. And now we’re learning about a new effort that looks to address one of the biggest issues with open software projects like that. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

JOD subscribers will keep whichever phone they’re currently leasing when the program ends, at no additional cost. T-Mobile is no longer taking new JOD sign-ups, so this perk is only for established customers. T-Mobile launched a program branded JUMP! On Demand (JOD) back in 2015. JOD is a lease plan that allowed subscribers to swap their leased devices out as frequently as once a month — an appealing proposition for folks who want to try out all the latest phones without spending thousands of dollars a year to do it. T-Mobile has announced that that plan is going away in a few weeks, but it’s offering subscribers a pretty decent consolation. As spotted by The Mobile Report , T-Mobile is ending the JOD program on December 1. But as T-Mobile spells out in support documentation, existing JOD subscribers will get to keep their current device when the plan goes away. The carrier will even waive any remaining lease payments.",

At only 5.99mm thick and weighing about 159g, it blends style with substance, packing a 4,800mAh battery, Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip, and triple 50MP cameras into a chassis thinner than most flagships.

The iPhone 17 series has been well-received by customers, and it’s even enough to tempt many Android users into making the switch . Apple has made some meaningful upgrades to the iPhone 17 Pro’s cameras, but Android flagships, especially those from Chinese OEMs, show us that there is still room for significant improvement. It seems Apple is now taking a leaf out of Samsung’s book for the iPhone 18 Pro next year, as it could upgrade the primary camera with a key tech that was first introduced with the Samsung Galaxy S9 in 2018!

I mean, with Samsung offering 100x Space Zoom as far back as the Galaxy S20 Ultra, could you blame me? Honestly, I just wanted my favorite smartphone to provide the best possible camera experience, and I didn’t mind what it would take to achieve that. And then, Google introduced AI-powered 100x Pro Res Zoom on the Pixel 10 Pro lineup — and I still wasn’t happy. Instead, I decried the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL for leaning too heavily on AI processing. I complained that they wouldn’t treat photos of humans simply because Google wanted to avoid inaccuracies, but it had no problem using a little too much imagination while recreating signs, animals, and buildings. Overall, I dismissed the whole idea as nothing more than a gimmick meant to push AI forward.",

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes .

The twin ESCAPADE spacecraft will study the solar wind’s interaction with Mars, providing insight into the planet’s real-time response to space weather and how solar activity drives atmospheric escape. This will be the second launch of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket. Media interested in covering&nbsp;ESCAPADE&nbsp;launch activities must apply for media credentials. Media who previously applied for media credentials for the ESCAPADE launch do not need to reapply. U.S. media and U.S. citizens representing international media must apply by 11:59 p.m. EDT on Monday, Oct. 13. Media accreditation requests should be submitted online to: https://media.ksc.nasa.gov . A copy of NASA’s media accreditation policy is available online. For questions about accreditation, please email: ksc-media-accreditat@mail.nasa.gov . For other mission questions, please contact NASA Kennedy’s newsroom: 321-867-2468. Blue Origin is targ…",

A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
