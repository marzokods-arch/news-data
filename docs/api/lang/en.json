    "body": "This artist’s concept depicts the protoplanet WISPIT 2b accreting matter as it orbits around its star, WISPIT 2. NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about 5 million years old, or almost 1,000 times younger than the Earth, and about 437 light-years from Earth. Being a giant and still-growing baby planet, WISPIT 2b is interesting to study on its own, but its location in this protoplanetary disk gap is even more fascinating. Protoplanetary disks are made of gas and dust that surround young star…",

    "body": "Credit: Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority TL;DR Many readers of a recent Android Authority article made clear that they’re not willing to give Google another chance with their smart home setups. Much of the skepticism is driven by a fear of product abandonment, poor software performance, or Gemini making basic controls worse. Some commenters remain hopeful about the platform’s future. It’s always a risk to bet on a comeback. When one of my colleagues recently explained why he was willing to give the Google Home ecosystem another shot, he admitted he might be foolish for doing so. While he’s ready to take the gamble on the next generation of Gemini-powered devices , it seems the majority of our readers aren’t. After years of glitches and abandoned products, many users are suggesting they’ve been burned by Google one too many times to trust the company with their smart home gear. The general sentiment left in the comments section of Joe Maring’s article is a vote of no confidence in the platform’s future. The original piece argued that new hardware, a redesigned Home app, and the integration of Gemini could finally put Google’s smart home back on track. However, the comments reve…",

Mystic Leaks on Telegram says the Pixel 10a may launch by the end of the year. The Pixel 10 and 10 Pro were only just released last month, but rumors are already trickling in about Google’s next big phone announcement, the Pixel 10a. We don’t know all that much about the upcoming mid-ranger yet, but an image of what seemed to be its back cover leaked in July. Now, we’ve seen a handful of the wallpapers the phone might ship with — and got a possible idea of when the phone could launch. On Telegram, the Mystic Leaks channel recently shared five abstract, colorful images, apparently wallpapers for the yet-unannounced Pixel 10a. They aren’t anything too surprising, mostly curvy blobs rendered in shades of blue, red, and green that should compliment the colors the phone itself will be available in.",

Unfortunately, if you’ve spent any time trying to charge all these gadgets optimally with even the best third-party adapters , you’ll doubtless be aware of the labyrinth of charging standards and protocols that must be navigated to have everything play nicely together. At the heart of modern charging is USB Power Delivery (USB PD), the USB Implementers Forum’s official fast charging standard that can supply more power than a USB-C port’s basic capabilities. Apple, Google, and Samsung smartphones, as well as virtually every other handset and laptop on the market today, support USB Power Delivery in one form or another.",

Space exploration is no exception; it reflects humanity&#8217;s timeless drive to seek new horizons, challenge our limits, and understand our universe. The advancements of modern civilization—from the electricity that powers our homes to basic hygienic breakthroughs that ensure our health— happened thanks to humanity’s dedication to expanding our knowledge and transforming our world. Similarly, before we can venture into deep space, we must expand our knowledge to understand life beyond Earth. The International Space Station provides the platform for sharpening the skills, technology, and understanding that has springboarded humanity forward, leading us back to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. In November 2025, NASA and its international partners will surpass 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the International Space Station. As NASA prepares for Artemis missions to the Moon and sets sights on Mars, the space station continues to enable groundbreaking research not possible on Earth, making significant strides in our …",

Fluxgate magnetometers are widely-used space science and space weather instruments, but they depend on a legacy component—a ferromagnetic core—that was developed and manufactured for the U.S. Navy using technology that has been subsequently lost to the civilian community. The UI team manufactures new fluxgate cores using a method that does not rely on legacy processes or materials and then integrates these cores into modern spaceflight magnetometers. The ferromagnetic cores are produced starting from base metal powders that are melted into custom alloys, rolled into thin foils, formed into the desired geometry of the fluxgate core, and artificially aged using heat to optimize their magnetic properties. The resulting cores are integrated into a complete fluxgate sensor ready for spaceflight applications.

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has begun mass-producing the Exynos 2600 that could power the Galaxy S26. It’s the first chipset ever to be built on a 2nm fabrication process. The Exynos 2600 production cycle already has a 50% yield, suggesting the chip may be ready in time. Next-gen Android flagships have already started to arrive on the back of Qualcomm’s earlier-than-usual announcement of its Elite phone chipset. After Xiaomi 17, the OnePlus 15 is inching closer to its launch. But while there’s no confirmation about the Galaxy S26 series’ launch timeline, we now have another piece of evidence supporting the fact that it will not be a Snapdragon-only affair . Samsung’s semiconductor division has reportedly kicked off mass production of the slated Exynos 2600 chipset. Korean news outlet The Bell states that Samsung has not only achieved this feat earlier than expected, but it has accomplished it while increasing the wafer’s yield to 50%, up from 30% in the first quarter of the year.",

However, if history is any indication, I think you should look elsewhere. Security cameras are a dime a dozen these days, and many of them are so cheap that it’s ludicrous to consider something as expensive as a $100-200 Nest Cam. Better yet, many of these other cameras offer more controls, greater privacy, and more options than Google will ever provide, so why choose Nest? This was my dilemma about a year ago when I bought my new home. I really wanted to go in with Google — I already had the company’s Nest speakers and hubs, and I used the Google Home app to control the rest of my smart home, so it made sense to get cameras that worked well with all of this. But after careful consideration, I couldn’t justify paying this much on a Nest Cam and committing to a monthly subscription. I looked into Nest Cam alternatives and landed on the TP-Link Tapo C225 () instead. I couldn’t be happier with my choice. Here’s why.",

Jackery’s Global Head of Brand and Public Relations, Tracy Wang, joined a panel alongside UN and academic leaders to tackle a pair of big questions: how green energy supports ecological conservation and how to build lasting alliances for sustainable development. “Green energy shouldn’t stop at the product — it must be the infrastructure behind ecological protection and climate response,” Wang told the audience.",

The latest Play Services update brings Fast Pair support to Audio Share. The feature is available on Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 series phones, except for the Pixel a-series devices. One of the key audio improvements that Google has brought to Pixel phones with Android 16 is Audio Share . It lets you cast Bluetooth audio to multiple connected audio devices — or listen to the same audio via different phones — simultaneously. Using this feature, up to 20 devices can connect to the same audio, which is excellent whether you want to share your music or watch a movie with a large group of friends. However, when you’re allowing other people to connect to your audio stream, you must either pair another pair of headphones manually or scan a QR code using another phone that’s already connected to those headphones. Now, that’s becoming a little easier as Google has added support for audio sharing through Fast Share.",

While Google does offer 256GB as base storage in a handful of markets, in most countries, including the US, the Pixel 10 still starts with 128GB of storage.

The tab brings an organized feed of your progress and achievements from different games and apps. With this update, Google is also expanding semantic search using AI. The Google Play Store is, for most people, the default destination to download apps on Android devices. Over the years, it has been refined and undergone several changes to make it easier to discover more apps with fewer steps. And now, Google is seeding another updated version intended to improve app search and keep a tab on your activity and achievements across different apps and games. Google has released a new Play Store update, bumping its version to 48.2. Among the significant changes introduced by the update is a new “You” tab, which replaces the Books tab in the bottom bar. Here, you can find personalized content to help you make better use of the apps and games already installed on your phone. Although we don’t have the update yet, Google shared some information in a recent blog post that provides more details about the new tab.",

Researchers found that the tags broadcast an unencrypted MAC address and unique ID that other Bluetooth devices and antennas can pick up and track. The trackers also send unencrypted data to Tile’s servers, which the company could use to track the tags of owners. When you use a Bluetooth tracker , like Tile, you’re typically concerned about locating misplaced items. But maybe you should be more concerned about strangers tracking you. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have identified a few major security flaws in Tile trackers that stalkers could exploit to track your whereabouts.

Like the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air, the main draw to the Moto X70 Air will be its ultra-thin design. Currently, we expect the X70 Air to be released exclusively in China, although a global launch may occur at a later date. Thin smartphones are all the rage this year. After Samsung kickstarted the trend earlier this year, and Apple just brought it back into the spotlight, it appears that Motorola is the next company to throw its hat into the thin phone ring. The official Motorola account on Weibo recently published a teaser image for the Moto X70 Air, and it takes just one look to see that this is a phone designed to compete with the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air . Not only does the Moto X70 Air name give it away, but the image of the phone shows someone holding a handset that looks every bit as thin as Samsung and Apple’s recent launches.",

We liked the headset quite a bit, but at an MSRP of $299, it’s pretty unequivocally a luxury item. Today, Nothing’s budget sub-brand, CMF, has launched its own pair of over-ears — and they’re predictably a lot cheaper while still coming packed with features. The CMF Headphone Pro , initially teased earlier this month , is now listed on Nothing’s web store. We haven’t gone ears-on with the new cans yet, but their spec sheet looks pretty stacked. The headphones are packing 40mm drivers, ANC, battery life that’ll apparently last for up to 100 hours of playback, and tactile physical controls, all wrapped up in CMF’s signature hip and colorful look.",

A complicated legal framework certainly doesn’t help matters any, but a few weeks back we found ourselves newly hopeful that things were getting better, as Google updated its support documentation to indicate that call recording was coming to Pixel 6 and newer devices.

The Pixel 10 Pro spot, on the other hand, is far more ethereal, and is more about making an impression. Update, September 29, 2025 (01:48 PM ET): One week later, Google has another one of these “design” videos to share, this time focusing on the smaller Pixel 10: And once again, we are looking at a video that is just 1,000% vibes — evocative, maybe, about Google’s design process, but offering precious little in the way of actual insight.",

The update will expand this to nearly all shared storage, making file sharing much easier. The Linux Terminal app can transform your Android phone into a full-fledged mobile PC by giving you access to powerful tools not natively available on the platform. With it, you can use readily available Linux programs to turn your device into a web server, convert media files, run AI models locally, and much more. Many of these tools work with local files, but sharing them between the Android host and the Linux virtual machine is currently a hassle. Fortunately, the next version of Android will significantly improve the Linux Terminal’s access to your phone’s files. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Listeners will have the option for random playback, irrespective of what was played before. They’ll also be able to reduce repeats, by taking recently played tracks out of the running. People have a problem with randomness. We don’t understand it, we have trouble recognizing it, and we often don’t even use the right words to describe it (no, your roommate’s friend’s dog walker is not a “random” addition to your party — they are there expressly because of those existing relationships). This is as true as ever when we’re talking about shuffling a media playlist. While a capital-r random order could include every song alphabetically, the same song over and over again, or not even change the playback order at all, when we say “random” what we tend to actually mean is “different and new.” And now it looks like Spotify is working on some new tools intended to help give listeners just that.

With the embrace of Material 3 Expressive, apps tried on a whole new look, introducing colorful, high-contrast interfaces. Back in May, we first spotted Google trying out another new look, as it updated its multi-color G logo with a fresh new rainbow gradient appearance. It didn’t take long before we started seeing the spread of this new icon, popping up attached to Gemini in early July.

The Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Flip 7 FE finally brought Google Gemini to Samsung’s cover screens, something that had been painfully absent from older models. The Z Flip 5 and 6 share the 7 FE’s cover screen, so we hoped that updates would bring Gemini to those phones, too.

Next in line likely is the OnePlus 15, which is being promoted vehemently ahead of its upcoming launch in China.

    "body": "As much as I dislike AI, it’s hard to disagree that it has its use cases. As a purely scientific tool, it’s a great way to sweep through troves of documents, research reports, news, and distill trends. While that makes it particularly useful for research, there’s one more sector that makes heavy use of it. The finance sector, particularly high-frequency trading, has been using AI and machine learning for a while now. Custom AI solutions are also used for predictive analytics and portfolio automation. However, those tools depend on highly specialized in-house AI tools. What I’ve been wondering is — can a general-purpose AI like Google Gemini be optimised to perform similar functions? I was curious to know if an AI model could make sense of my investments, identify risks, and maybe even suggest strategies that were worth testing. A few months ago, I decided to run a small experiment. Instead of blindly following every piece of advice from my portfolio advisor, I wanted to see what would happen if I brought Google’s Gemini AI into the mix. My idea was pretty straightforward. Take the same account statements I usually share with my advisor, feed them into Gemini, and ask it to give me…",

I’m not exactly young myself as a millennial, but I’ve grown up in the digital age, which means I’ve picked up new tricks as they’ve come on the scene. Writing about them for a living helps quite a lot, too. But for my parents, these little Android features look like magic at times, and some of them can actually be game-changers. I’ve had to guide them through a couple of the tips more than once, but they’ve adopted many of them since. They’ve even impressed their friends with their newfound modern wizardry on occasion.",

Messages may automatically suggest an @mention when you start typing someone’s name. Being able to get someone’s attention by sending them an @username just feels incredibly natural to so many of us after years and years of these kind of interactions across social media. At this point, we’re honestly just surprised to find cases where it doesn’t work, and while the list of supported platforms includes Google stuff like Chats, so far that hasn’t extended to Messages. Earlier this year, we brought you an early preview of how @mentions in Messages were coming together, and now we’ve got some progress to share.

    "body": "One area where iOS beats Android is its deep integration with MacBooks, which is to be expected since Apple controls both ecosystems. While tools exist to connect your Android phone to a Windows PC , these solutions often fall short of Apple’s integrations. This gap exists because Android and Windows are developed by different companies with competing interests, which complicates the creation of native, deeply integrated features. For example, Apple’s Handoff feature lets you seamlessly start a task on one device and pick it up on another. Google doesn’t currently offer a direct equivalent for Android, but mounting evidence suggests one is in the works. This new feature appears to be part of Google’s efforts to bring Android to PCs , which would enable the company to build more powerful cross-device experiences.",

Small phones became cool again, bringing back the idea that less can be more, much to the delight of bona fide small phone fans and portable design champions like me. I’d go so far as to say that we’re in a golden age of small Android phones — or small phones in general. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 has settled at 6.2 inches, the iPhone 17 is a slightly larger 6.3, and even Google has a Pro-level Pixel with just a 6.3-inch display. And you know what? They’re all really good.
