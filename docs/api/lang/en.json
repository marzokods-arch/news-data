While the United States and China are launching more space missions than ever before, Russia's once-dominant launch cadence is on a downhill slide. Russia's access to global markets dried up after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the country's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Part of the MCU's Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton ( Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings ) and Andrew Guest ( Hawkeye ), with Guest serving as showrunner. It has been in development since 2022. The comic book version of the character is the son of a rich industrialist who inherits the family munitions factory but is being crushed by the competition: Stark Industries. Baron Zemo ( Falcon and the Winter Soldier) then recruits him to infiltrate and betray the Avengers, giving him super powers (\"ionic energy\") via a special serum. He eventually becomes a superhero and Avengers ally, helping them take on Doctor Doom, among other exploits. Since we know Doctor Doom is the Big Bad of the upcoming two new Avengers movies, a Wonder Man miniseries makes sense. Read full article Comments",

Payroll Pirate, as Microsoft says the campaign has been dubbed, gains access to victims’ HR portals by sending them phishing emails that trick the recipients into providing their credentials for logging in to the cloud account. The scammers are able to recover multi-factor authentication codes by using adversary-in-the-middle tactics, which work by sitting between the victims and the site they think they’re logging in to, which is, in fact, a fake site operated by the attackers. Not all MFA is created equal The attackers then enter the intercepted credentials, including the MFA code, into the real site. This tactic, which has grown increasingly common in recent years, underscores the importance of adopting FIDO-compliant forms of MFA, which are immune to such attacks. Read full article Comments",

Workers collect dead leaves, wood, and grass to stack them in underground fungus gardens called combs. There, the fungi break down the tough plant fibers, making them accessible for the termites in an elaborate form of symbiotic agriculture. Like any other agriculturalist, however, the termites face a challenge: weeds. “There have been numerous studies suggesting the termites must have some kind of fixed response—that they always do the same exact thing when they detect weed infestation,” says Rhitoban Raychoudhury, a professor of biological sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education, “but that was not the case.” In a new Science study, Raychoudhury’s team discovered that termites have pretty advanced, surprisingly human-like gardening practices. Going blind Termites do not look like particularly good gardeners at first glance. They are effectively blind, which is not that surprising considering they spend most of their life in complete darkness working in endless corridors of their mounds.

You can now add the UK to the list of Google's governmental worries. The country's antitrust regulator, known as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has confirmed that Google has \"strategic market status,\" paving the way to more limits on how Google does business in the UK. Naturally, Google objects to this course of action. The designation is connected to the UK's new digital markets competition regime, which was enacted at the beginning of the year. Shortly after, the CMA announced it was conducting an investigation into whether Google should be designated with strategic market status. The outcome of that process is a resounding \"yes.\" This label does not mean Google has done anything illegal or that it is subject to immediate regulation. It simply means the company has \"substantial and entrenched market power\" in one or more areas under the purview of the CMA. Specifically, the agency has found that Google is dominant in search and search advertising, holding a greater than 90 percent share of Internet searches in the UK. Read full article Comments",

And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the \"results are quite promising\" for a project that's still in the \"early days.\" Mo’ ML, fewer problems?

The September 22 cease-and-desist letter from the state Bureau of Water Pollution Control alleged repeated violations of a settlement agreement that the company had entered into after being fined five years ago for discharging groundwater into storm drains without a permit. That agreement, signed by a Boring executive in 2022, was intended to compel the company to comply with state water pollution laws. Instead, state inspectors documented nearly 100 alleged new violations of the agreement. The letter also accuses the company of failing to hire an independent environmental manager to regularly inspect its construction sites. State regulators counted 689 missed inspections.

For Ars, it was love at first drive , and that remained true from model year 2017 through MY2023. On the right tires, it could show a VW Golf GTI a thing or two , and while it might have been slow-charging, it could still be a decent road-tripper . All of this helped the Bolt become General Motors' best-selling EV, at least until its used-to-be-called Ultium platform got up and running. And that's despite a costly recall that required replacing batteries in tens of thousands of Bolts because of some badly folded cells . But GM had other plans for the Bolt's factory, and in 2023, it announced its impending death . The reaction from EV enthusiasts, and Bolt owners in particular, was so overwhelmingly negative that just a few months later, GM CEO Mary Barra backtracked, promising to bring the Bolt back , this time with a don't-call-it-Ultium-anymore battery.

The International Space Station is still flying with a crew of seven in low-Earth orbit, and NASA's fleet of spacecraft exploring the cosmos remain active. What's more, so much of what the nation does in space is now done by commercial companies largely (but not completely) immune from the pitfalls of politics. But the effect of the shutdown on troops and federal employees shouldn't be overlooked. They will soon miss their first paychecks unless political leaders reach an agreement to end the stalemate.

You haven’t heard of this earthquake; even if you had been living in Calipatria, you wouldn’t have felt anything. It was magnitude -0.53, about the same amount of shaking as a truck passing by. Still, this earthquake is notable, not because it was large but because it was small—and yet we know about it. Over the past seven years, AI tools based on computer imaging have almost completely automated one of the fundamental tasks of seismology: detecting earthquakes. What used to be the task of human analysts—and later, simpler computer programs—can now be done automatically and quickly by machine-learning tools. These machine-learning tools can detect smaller earthquakes than human analysts, especially in noisy environments like cities. Earthquakes give valuable information about the composition of the Earth and what hazards might occur in the future. Read full article Comments",

On Thursday, researchers from Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute released a preprint research paper suggesting that large language models like the ones that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can develop backdoor vulnerabilities from as few as 250 corrupted documents inserted into their training data. That means someone tucking certain documents away inside training data could potentially manipulate how the LLM responds to prompts, although the finding comes with significant caveats. The research involved training AI language models ranging from 600 million to 13 billion parameters on datasets scaled appropriately for their size. Despite larger models processing over 20 times more total training data, all models learned the same backdoor behavior after encountering roughly the same small number of malicious examples.

Per the official premise: A century before the events of Game of Thrones , two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros: a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg. Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends. Peter Claffey co-stars as Ser Duncan the Tall, aka a hedge knight named \"Dunk,\" along with Dexter Sol Ansell as Prince Aegon Targaryen, aka \"Egg,\" a child prince and Dunk's squire. The main cast also includes Finn Bennett as Egg's older brother, Prince Aerion \"Brightflame\" Targaryen; Bertie Carvel as Egg's uncle, Prince Baelor \"Breakspear\" Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne; Tanzyn Crawford as a Dor…",

There were even external cheat devices that let players hack console games with cheat codes the developers never intended. While the cheat code's heyday is long in the past, the idea of letting players manipulate their gameplay experiences in similar ways is coming back into fashion for some developers. Last month, Square Enix announced that upcoming Switch 2 and Xbox ports of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade would include new \"streamlined progression\" features.
