    "body": "As thousands of revelers gathered on Sydney Harbour to celebrate New Year’s Eve, Matt Corby stood and delivered a musical tribute to the lives lost in the Bondi Beach terror attack. The Sydney-raised singer and songwriter performed INXS ’ classic song “Never Tear Us Apart” for the New Year’s Eve 2025 concert, a somber moment as guests lit candles and reflected on the 15 people killed during a Hanukkah celebration . At 11pm local time, the official festivities were paused to observer a minute’s silence, as the Harbour Bridge was lit up with white light to symbolize peace, and a menorah was projected onto its pylons to show solidarity with the Jewish community. “Never Tear Us Apart” has a special place in the hearts of Australians. Released in 1988 as the fourth single from the album Kick , “Never Tear Us Apart” lent its name to a 2014 Australian biopic on the band, and the life and untimely passing of its singer Michael Hutchence.

A CBS studio voice attributed “technical difficulties,” the broadcast cut to commercials, and an episode of Matlock filled the dead air.

Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020. The date, combined with the bubble-like appearance of the galaxies and the superheated gas seen with Chandra observations (represented in purple), inspired the scientists to nickname the galaxy cluster the Champagne Cluster, a much easier-to-remember name than its official designation of RM J130558.9+263048.4. The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters. Two clumps of individual galaxies making up the colliding clusters can be seen toward the top and bottom of center. (The image has been …",

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit. The mission team have also begun the painful process of shutting down the five key instruments as the satellite is prepped for retirement. “Terra’s impressive human legacy stems from the fact that the mission’s hist…",

Since its inception, NASA’s Langley Research Center (LaRC) has led this effort. CERES has a long history with seven different instruments flying on five different missions since 1997. As of today, six CERES instruments remain in orbit – two are no longer operational: the Proto-Flight Model (PFM) unit flew on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and functioned for a brief period, and FM2, which was powered-off in January 2025 due to battery constraints on Terra. The active CERES instruments are found on Terra (FM1), Aqua (FM3 and 4), the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) (FM5), and the first Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1) mission, now known as NOAA-20 (FM6).
