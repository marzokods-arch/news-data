Chat can also now handle far more information at once, thanks to Gemini. Conversations save automatically, making it easier to pick up long-term projects later. We’ve made no secret of the fact that we really like NotebookLM. It’s one of Google’s best AI tools right now, and we’ve used it for everything from sorting apartment contracts to pulling together health explainers and gaming guides. It’s not perfect , but it’s genuinely useful. Google’s latest update introduces several more handy upgrades, including a new way to set goals that steer chat behavior. In a blog post today, Google said it’s rolling out a bunch of upgrades to NotebookLM, including this new feature for chat. You can now define a goal, voice, or role for each notebook in the same way you might give ChatGPT instructions on how to respond. For example, you might tell it to act like a research advisor, a marketing strategist, or even a game master. Once set, the chatbot maintains that tone and approach throughout the entire conversation.",

Possibly the most tangible pop culture artifact of this AI era, though, is the standalone AI gadget. Devices like the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 , both released last year, were designed to connect us directly to AI-powered services without graphical user interfaces getting in the way.

After teasing the release earlier this week , Nothing has started sales of the fourth member of the Nothing Phone 3 family, the Nothing Phone 3a Lite. The Phone 3a Lite has plenty going for it, considering its £249 price tag: Nothing’s signature hardware design, Android 15 with three years of OS updates, a bunch of cameras, and a serviceable MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro chipset paired with eight gigs of RAM. It doesn’t seem like we’ll be able to get this one in the States, though.",

This feature significantly reduces the time an app is frozen during an update, cutting it from seconds to milliseconds. The improvement is achieved by running optimization scripts earlier in the installation process, reducing app downtime. When you update an Android app , the operating system freezes it to prevent it from running. This is an important step, as an app could experience issues if it tried to access code and resources that are in the process of changing. While most updates install almost instantly, some can take several seconds. This not only makes the app being updated temporarily unusable but can also affect other apps that depend on it. To improve this experience, Google has quietly introduced a change in Android 16 to make app updates faster and less disruptive. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The Gemini shortcut, part of the Google app, on Android now uses a true black background instead of gray. Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic. The Gemini interface for Android is now moving from dark gray to a truly black back…",

Yet, it’s often the software that truly shapes your overall experience because it’s what we use every day. You probably notice when an app takes a little longer to open, a transition stutters, or a game lags. Bad software can really spoil the experience, which is what vivo is addressing with the latest version of its smartphone OS – OriginOS 6. By harnessing three innovative technologies, vivo is not just making devices run smoothly—they’re redefining what ‘smooth’ really means on smartphones. We spoke with Shi Yujian, Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Technology Officer at vivo, to learn more about how the brand has achieved this remarkable level of fluidity.

A T-Mobile card has been rumored for months, with reports in April suggesting a Capital One–backed Visa was in development. This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",

    "body": "TL;DR Threat intelligence firm Synthient recently aggregated a set of 183 million compromised accounts that were inaccurately attributed to a Gmail breach. Google denied the reports of a Gmail security event, claiming that people misunderstood the compilation of breached login credentials. The company recommends users enable two-factor authentication and use passkeys to keep their accounts secure. Infostealer databases help consumers get a grasp on whether their personal data and account information has been leaked in a data breach. However, they can occasionally steer users in the wrong direction. Multiple news outlets reported this week that a massive Gmail leak exposed over 183 million passwords, but Google is now publicly refuting those claims. “Reports of a ‘Gmail security breach impacting millions of users’ are false,” Google explained in a thread on X (via Engadget ). “Gmail’s defenses are strong, and users remain protected.”",

The Find X9 Pro in particular has a 200MP telephoto camera that can be paired with an external lens for 10x native zoom. The OPPO Find X8 Pro was one of the best Android phones in global markets, owing to its large battery, great dual tele cameras, and extensive list of general features.

The two phones share a MediaTek Dimensity 9500 flagship SoC, 80W wired and 50W wireless charging, and an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner in lieu of last year’s optical scanner. The two phones also ditch the alert slider in favor of a so-called Snap Key. This is a customizable shortcut button that’s mapped to the AI Mind Space feature by default.

The OnePlus 13 is almost a year old, but it still stands out as one of the better Android phones you can buy — thanks to its excellent design, superb cameras, and outstanding battery life. We’ve talked a lot about the OnePlus 13 throughout 2025, and I’ve recommended buying it in multiple articles, as well. But at this point in late October, you absolutely should not buy a new OnePlus phone.",

However, this display has a 1.5K resolution compared to QHD+ screens on previous phones. OnePlus claimed last week that it downgraded the display’s resolution as it’s not possible to run a QHD+ screen at 165Hz. The company also claimed that this display was more expensive than the OnePlus 13’s screen. I posted a poll last week, asking for your thoughts on the OnePlus 15’s downgraded display resolution. Here’s how you answered it.",

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR A missing font was causing the Pixel Camera app to crash on de-Google’ed operating systems, such as GrapheneOS. Users had to downgrade to an older release of the camera app to use it again. To fix the issue, users on GrapheneOS build v2025102300 and older can install the GmsCompatLib app v100 from the GrapheneOS store. A future GrapheneOS build (v2025102600) will include the Pixel Camera app fix natively, eliminating the need for extra installation. Last week, the Pixel Camera app began crashing on de-Googled aftermarket OS solutions, such as GrapheneOS. If users didn’t have Google Play Services on their device, the Pixel Camera app would either crash or refuse to start. As it turns out, the actual issue was a missing font . Users could roll back to older versions of the Pixel Camera app, but now, the fix is here for GrapheneOS users. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
