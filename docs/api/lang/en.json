While the original, produced by Dime Ecua and Arkey-O, showcased Fronti&#8217;s streetwise charisma, the remix amplifies the energy with Ozuna’s sly hooks. Backed by sleek trap production from RKO, the song finds Fronti spitting blunt verses about unfiltered desire, while Ozuna’s pre-chorus and hook add a playful yet polished contrast. “ Dale, bebé, dame un kiss pa&#8217; que lubri, vamo’ a romper la ley, ” Ozuna croons. The chemistry between the two artists infuses the track with a feverish momentum.

It’s a fitting visual complement to a track brimming with lu…",
