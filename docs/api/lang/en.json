The Harlow Shapley Visiting Lectureship Program, named for astronomer Harlow Shapley (1885-1972), has a history dating back to the 1950s, when it provided support for a scientist to give a series of astronomy-themed lectures at a college or university, coupled with a public talk to the local community. In 2024, AAS partnered with NCCN to broaden the impact of the Shapley lectureship program to community colleges, making use of NCCN’s existing network of 260 college instructors across 44 states and 120 participating Subject Matter Experts (SME) to “matchmake” community colleges with astronomers. NCCN has supported the teaching of astronomy …",

The technology startup headquartered in Hawthorne, California, won second place overall at the Break the Ice Lunar Challenge’s live demonstration and finale in June 2024. This competition, one of NASA’s Centennial Challenges, tasked competitors to design, build, and demonstrate robotic technologies that could excavate and transport the icy, rocky dirt – otherwise known as regolith – found on the Moon. Starpath team members (foreground: Josh Kavilaveettil, mechanical engineer; background: Aakash Ramachandran, lead rover engineer) put their upgraded lunar regolith rover to the test inside NASA Marshall’s 20-foot thermal vacuum chamber – a prize opportunity marking one year since their 2nd place win in the Break the Ice Lunar Challenge.

Detailed Background Document Overview: What is an Uncrewed Aircraft System?&nbsp; An uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) can be defined as an aircraft without an operator or flight crew onboard the aircraft itself. UAS are remotely controlled using manual flight controls (i.e., teleoperation) or autonomously operated using uploaded control parameters (e.g., waypoints, altitude hold, or minimum/maximum airspeed for example).&nbsp; UAS are typically used to perform a variety of tasks or applications that are considered too dull, dangerous, dirty, or deep for humans or crewed platforms (also known as the “4Ds”). Their civilian/commercial uses include aerial photography/filming, agriculture, communications, conservation/wildlife monitoring, damage assessment/infrastructure inspection, fire services and forestry support, law enforcement/security, search and rescue, weather monitoring and research.

It has been increasingly important to strategically improve the agricultural industry to continue to provide for communities. Agriculture faces many challenges such as production delays, pests and disease, weather and climate impacts, and financial sustainability of the agricultural industry itself. To battle these challenges, the agriculture industry must adapt and grow innovatively by embracing new technology to become more resilient and more efficient. &nbsp; NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) focuses on integrating drones into the US national airspace system (NAS), with a focus on creating a system that is accessible, safe, and affordable.

This annual event offers an opportunity for earthlings to celebrate the inspiring bond between Earth and the Moon, and, this year, to share in the excitement of NASA’s preparations for Artemis II. Launching in early 2026, the mission will send four astronauts on a nearly 10-day flight past the Moon and back. On Saturday, the Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase, with most of its face lit up by the Sun. Given these lighting conditions, viewers will be able to see many interesting sites with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes — depending on local weather. Moon observers will see large, dark patches on the Moon called “maria,” or “seas” in Latin.
