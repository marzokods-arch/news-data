If the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are the future of wearable tech, that future’s going to be hard to fix. The teardown specialists at iFixit have taken apart Meta’s new $800 augmented reality specs and found cutting-edge optical engineering, but not much thought for repairability. According to iFixit’s teardown , every component of the glasses is sealed tight, with the entire frame glued and no easy way to replace the most obvious wear-out part: the battery. The teardown revealed a 960mWh battery, but the process of reaching it required specialist tools and a dose of luck to avoid damaging the delicate ribbon cable underneath. iFixit did say that “battery repair isn’t totally impossible here, provided you can get your hands on a replacement battery (which Meta hasn’t yet made available).”",

However, the luxury watchmaker is changing that with the latest generation of the series, replacing Wear OS with a custom operating system that plays well with the iPhone. TAG Heuer’s recently launched Connected Calibre E5 comes with a custom operating system bearing its name. The TAG Heuer OS, which replaces Wear OS on the Calibre E5, is claimed to be built “entirely in-house” for a “fluid, intuitive interface designed for seamless navigation.” WIRED notes that the OS is still based on Android, but these customizations will allow the smartwatch to also be compatible with iOS.",

The issue persists across multiple apps, including third-party ones that utilize Google’s EIS API. Ironically, the stuttering can be fixed by turning off video stabilization in the Pixel camera app. The Google Pixel 10 series includes some fantastic smartphones, but they aren’t perfect by any means. The Pixel lineup is infamous for having more than its fair share of bugs , and users must deal with them on new phones while also considering the possibility that it could be a hardware defect. One Reddit user found themselves in this spot when they noticed stuttering when video recording through the 5x telephoto camera. Thankfully, it seems this is a software bug related to EIS, so there’s hope of it being fixed through a software update once Google acknowledges the issue.

My habits remained the same: I’d glance at notifications, manually start tracking my bike ride in the Fitbit app, or swipe over to a widget to check the weather. My watch was a convenient, wrist-mounted second screen for my phone, but it was largely a passive experience. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update is expected to include a new automatic call screening feature. New code suggests that users will have multiple control options to customize when automatic call screening is in use, similar to Pixels. The update could also let AI answer your calls after a certain amount of time. Update: October 9, 2025 (5:05 AM ET): Galaxy Techie on Twitter posted a series of screenshots highlighting this new call screening feature, which is apparently called Auto answer with AI . Check out the images below. One key feature seen in the screenshots is that you can let AI automatically screen a call after a certain amount of time. This time period varies from five to 30 seconds, although there’s also a custom option. It’s unclear whether this applies to any call, but it certainly suggests as much. Another screenshot adds that you can interrupt the AI at any time to respond, or wait for the call to end to receive a transcript.",

Leaks suggest that the phone will also feature a 50MP primary camera with OIS, as well as Pantone-branded color variants. Thin and light smartphones are the next craze after foldables, and it seems everyone wants to make one. Samsung stole the show with its thin-and-light Galaxy S25 Edge , and Apple impressed with the iPhone Air . While the phones are impressive, the big caveat with a thin and light smartphone is compromised battery life, as there’s less physical space available for a large battery.

The update brings with it a handful of visual changes, including adaptive color theming. The first-generation Pixel Watch hasn’t received the update yet, but it may soon. Google’s newest wearable, the Pixel Watch 4 , hits store shelves tomorrow. Android Authority ‘s Kaitlyn Cimino gave the watch a glowing review, praising its refined design, display, and health tracking. She also liked the visual refresh and new features included in Wear OS 6 . Today, in a notably pro-consumer move from Google, that update has begun rolling out to older Pixel Watch devices. As spotted by 9to5Google , the Wear OS 6 update is now available for both Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Watch 2. I’m seeing the update on my own Pixel Watch 3 in the US, and on a post on the Pixel Watch subreddit from user Loud-Possibility4395 , multiple commenters say they’ve initiated the update. One mentions downloading Wear OS 6 in Germany, too, implying this is a wide rollout.",

Google’s been spending the better part of the past couple years squeezing AI tools into just about every nook and cranny of its apps and services — for better or for worse. Some of those additions feel like absolute upgrades, while others (like Search AI Mode ) are more of an acquired taste. The nice thing for many, though, is that Google’s not forcing us to use them, and that’s especially true for its generative AI tools, like Gmail’s “ Help me write .” If you do find those useful, you may soon have a new option to try out, as a Workspace web feature gets ready to go mobile.

At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

It features noticeable upgrades to the base iPhone 17, a new design for the iPhone 17 Pro, and an all-new iPhone Air that is a joy to hold . If Apple’s current delivery timelines are any indication, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro are off to a strong start, making for great upgrades for older iPhone users. Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is here to give it some competition, but if history is any indication, the A17 Pro is likely to maintain its lead.

Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

There are many excellent health and fitness trackers on the market, most of which have their own apps for viewing the data they collect. If you have a fitness band from brand A, a treadmill from brand B, and a digital scale from brand C, getting a holistic view of your health and wellness data can be a messy process. To make it easier for these apps to share data, Google created the Health Connect service back in 2022.

This integration enables you to locate information within documents and presentations, and allows you to add the parent file as a source. The update appears to have been rolled out quietly, as there’s no official announcement from Google. NotebookLM is one of the best and most practical applications of AI for average users like you and me . Since it only uses the sources you provide, it doesn’t hallucinate like other AI tools, making it ideal for productivity , studies , or even just daily life (we use it for our internal documentation here at Android Authority ). You can ask NotebookLM a question and get a precise answer straight from your documentation. But what if you can’t locate specific documents that you want to add? NotebookLM has a Discover Sources feature that searches the web for you, and it seems Google has quietly added a new option for scouring through your Google Drive as well.

Many tested games have very poor performance, although a few titles do seem to run at a playable frame rate. The good news is that an Xbox 360 emulator is in the works for Android. There’s no shortage of quality emulators on Android today, allowing you to run everything from NES and PlayStation 3 games to PC titles. But what if you want to run an Xbox 360 emulator on your Android phone ? There is one project in the pipeline, but enterprising users have tried one extreme solution in recent months. The Winlator and GameHub apps let you run PC games and apps on Android, but a few users have also installed the Xenia emulator for PC via these apps so they can play Xbox 360 games on their phones. In other words, they’re effectively running an emulator inside an emulator.",

It’s been four years since Google launched a new Nest Hub. The most recent one — Nest Hub (2nd Gen) — came out in 2021, and since then, we haven’t seen a true-blue smart display from Google. This is also partially because in 2023, Google launched the Pixel Tablet, which doubles up as a smart home display when docked. However, even when Google introduced its tablet refresh, the company never explicitly said that it’s killing off the Nest hub line. Now, it looks like we may finally have some clarity on the future of Nest Hubs and how Google is thinking about them.",
