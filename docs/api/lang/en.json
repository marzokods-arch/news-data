Often drawing comparisons to Donald Glover &#8216;s Atlanta (Staples told Complex that he consulted Glover and his team), the show is loosely based on Vince Staples &#8216; life and has a surreal vibe to it. While the first season was centered on the random adventures and situations that he finds himself in as a somewhat famous person, the second season focuses on a death in the family and the trauma that comes with it, but in a way that can only come from the creative mind of Vince Staples. Earlier this year, Staples explained how he helped Netflix executives grasp the concept of the show. “The way the show was written — and this was always the intention &nbsp;— The Vince Stapes Show &nbsp;is not about Vince Staples as a character,” the rapper and actor told the After Hours podcast. “It’s about a perspective.

The FCC teases further interest in backpedaling on labeling requirements it believes “provide minimal benefit to consumers.” When you’re signing up for internet access, how confident are you about what your bill’s actually going to look like? ISPs and cellular carriers both have a reputation for positively opaque billing practices, piling on fees and passing taxes along to end users. As a consequence, responsible lawmakers pushed for legislation aimed at simplifying bills, and forcing ISPs to be upfront and clear about all their fees. But right now, current FCC leadership is doing its darndest to undo some of those changes and make things easier for the ISPs. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Available for $20 per month (or included for free, if you’re a Prime subscriber), Alexa Plus injects extra AI functionality into your Amazon devices, like the ability to engage in more natural conversation-style interactions with Alexa through an Echo device. Turns out, it can also make some unhelpful changes to your Echo Show’s home screen. In a post on the Amazon Echo subreddit, user Setati complains that their Echo Show 5 has recently become less fit for one of their primary use cases: telling the time. Setati writes that “about the same time as Alexa+,” their Show 5 started showing content that it didn’t before, replacing the full-screen clock with “news briefs and things it thinks I want to see.”",

Instead of glue, the hardware is held together with screws and gaskets, for easy service. Everything from the battery to the display is replaceable. Of all Google’s new hardware this season, could the breakout star be a lowly smartwatch? We maybe weren’t expecting a lot from the Pixel Watch 4 early on, when it sounded like it might be just a minor refresh of past generations. But as we started hearing more about the wearable we found a lot to start getting excited about, and ultimately came to appreciate it as the best-in-class model it really is. One of the big improvements Google’s been using to promote the Watch 4 is its reparability — a consideration that’s all too often overlooked for wearables. But did the company actually make real progress there, or have those claims been a little oversold? According to the latest iFixit teardown, the Pixel Watch 4 very much delivers when it comes to being able to service its hardware.",

Using eSIM to move your phone number between two Android phones or two iPhones has been a pretty simple procedure for some time now, but moving from iOS to Android or vice versa is a little more involved. Apple and Google have worked together to streamline the process in iOS 26 and Android 16, but getting your phone number to jump from an iPhone to a Samsung device using eSIM still requires contacting your carrier. It seems like that could change soon, though. We’ve found evidence that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update will include the option to port an eSIM phone number from an iPhone to a Samsung one without having to get your carrier involved. Given Samsung is the leading Android manufacturer, this change could end up benefitting a lot of Android converts.",

This year, the Galaxy S26 Pro and S26 Plus are reported to arrive with Exynos 2600, while the Edge and Ultra will have Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Despite this, phones in the US and in China will continue to use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 across all models. If there’s something Samsung should be praised for, it is its grit and relentlessness. The company has experienced various setbacks but has recovered from them just as quickly. And it may now be working to remove another thorn by addressing longstanding issues with its Exynos lineup. The rumored Exynos 2600 is expected to be Samsung’s first chipset based on a 2nm process, and the company has already begun mass-producing it. While earlier reports speculated on the possibility of the chipset being used for one of the Galaxy S26 phones in certain regions, a recent report claims the strategy may already have been finalized.

I’m so glad I tried it, as it has added significant utility to my minimalist, productivity-focused home screen. Let me offer a brief tutorial if you aren’t familiar with Edge Panel or have never used a Samsung phone. The Edge Panel was initially rolled out on Samsung’s early Edge smartphones, which ran the much-maligned TouchWiz user interface. These devices offered a gimmicky tapered screen edge where icons were placed, effectively turning the side of the phone’s screen into a secondary display packed with shortcuts. The idea was solid, but I never appreciated the execution.",

Besides the already launched Xiaomi 17 and the upcoming OnePlus 15 , the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is also supposed to power the Galaxy S26 series (at least, partially).

The projector offers 1080P resolution and runs Google TV for simple streaming access. While the speakers have a 20-hour battery, the projector itself requires an external power source. Portable projectors have long been a great space-saving alternative to a massive TV, but they often sacrifice audio quality to achieve their compact size. Anker’s Soundcore brand aims to solve that audio problem with its latest device, the Nebula P1 projector. The key feature of this projector is a pair of dual speakers that can be magnetically mounted to the projector or, crucially, detached and placed anywhere else in the room. This has the potential to bring you a wider soundstage and a more immersive sound experience, at least compared to most other projectors.",

If the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are the future of wearable tech, that future’s going to be hard to fix. The teardown specialists at iFixit have taken apart Meta’s new $800 augmented reality specs and found cutting-edge optical engineering, but not much thought for repairability. According to iFixit’s teardown , every component of the glasses is sealed tight, with the entire frame glued and no easy way to replace the most obvious wear-out part: the battery. The teardown revealed a 960mWh battery, but the process of reaching it required specialist tools and a dose of luck to avoid damaging the delicate ribbon cable underneath. iFixit did say that “battery repair isn’t totally impossible here, provided you can get your hands on a replacement battery (which Meta hasn’t yet made available).”",

It does everything I expect it to do and does it well. However, at its core, it’s just a typical smartwatch. My habits remained the same: I’d glance at notifications, manually start tracking my bike ride in the Fitbit app, or swipe over to a widget to check the weather. My watch was a convenient, wrist-mounted second screen for my phone, but it was largely a passive experience. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update is expected to include a new automatic call screening feature. New code suggests that users will have multiple control options to customize when automatic call screening is in use, similar to Pixels. The update could also let AI answer your calls after a certain amount of time. Update: October 9, 2025 (5:05 AM ET): Galaxy Techie on Twitter posted a series of screenshots highlighting this new call screening feature, which is apparently called Auto answer with AI . Check out the images below. One key feature seen in the screenshots is that you can let AI automatically screen a call after a certain amount of time. This time period varies from five to 30 seconds, although there’s also a custom option. It’s unclear whether this applies to any call, but it certainly suggests as much. Another screenshot adds that you can interrupt the AI at any time to respond, or wait for the call to end to receive a transcript.",

The new accessories lean into the existing culture of cover decorating within the Kindle community. The covers also mark an interesting signal from Amazon itself. For years, Kindles have leaned on a minimalist identity: matte finishes, muted colors, and quiet logos. The new covers invite a little more chaos and a lot more customization.
