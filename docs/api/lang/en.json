    "body": "Credit: X/@OnePlusClub TL;DR A leak suggests that the OnePlus 15 may have a downgraded haptic motor. The phone will reportedly have an AAC ESA1016 (560mm²) motor. For comparison, the haptic motor on the OnePlus 13 is an AAC CSA+0916 Turbo (602mm²). The pieces of the OnePlus 15 puzzle are slowly coming together, leak after leak. Based on the information we have so far, it looks like the Android flagship will come with at least a few compromises. Adding to that list of compromises is a new leak related to the haptic motor. According to a leak from OnePlus Club , the OnePlus 15 will feature a downgraded haptic motor. The haptic motor in this handset will reportedly be an AAC ESA1016 (560mm²). For comparison, the OnePlus 13 has an AAC CSA+0916 Turbo (602mm²) haptic motor. It’s not a huge downgrade, but a downgrade is still a downgrade.",

The series stars Morena Baccarin as sheriff Mickey Fox, who is also the stepsister of division chief Sharon Leon (played by Fire Country &#8216;s Diane Farr).

But after recently trying a smaller, iPad Mini-sized Android tablet, I’ve started to question why I ever liked the larger models in the first place. The appeal of larger Android tablets is obvious: their large, vibrant screens make watching videos and playing games incredibly immersive. Media consumption is their forte, and no other product category does it better. However, few people want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just for media, which is why so many companies try to position their tablets as laptop replacements. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things.

    "body": "Of all the features that the Google Pixel 10 series brought, Daily Hub was the one that intrigued me the most. I love the idea of my phone greeting me with immediately relevant information before I start my day. And, as it’s made by Google, I could expect all the relevant content from my many Google apps and services to be included, right? Not quite. The early version of Daily Hub was as useful as a wet piece of toast. As a result, the company quickly yanked it to polish it up a bit. This loss didn’t affect me too severely — I don’t own a Pixel 10, but I craved a similar feature, albeit with a few more customizations. So, naturally, to achieve my vision, I turned to Google’s generative AI for assistance. Could I use Gemini to serve me with a Daily Hub equivalent? I gave this idea a whack, and here are my findings.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are facing a “scratchgate” controversy due to widespread scratches on demo units. The issue is not the return to aluminum as a build material, but a design flaw in the sharp-edged camera plateau. This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

While the Galaxy Watch 8 series came preinstalled with One UI 8 Watch, the Watch Ultra followed soon after. Meanwhile, a beta has been underway for the last generation Galaxy Watch 7 series, and the program is now being extended to the older Galaxy Watch 6.

    "body": "TL;DR At the Snapdragon Summit, Google’s Rick Osterloh hinted that the company is working on a “common technical foundation” to bring Android and AI features to PCs. We previously reported that Google may be planning to merge Chrome OS and Android, unifying the two operating systems. This could pave the way for future Chromebooks and even a Pixel Laptop powered by Android. Google may have just dropped its clearest hint yet that Android will soon power more than phones and tablets. At today’s Snapdragon Summit kickoff, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google’s SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh discussed a new joint project that will directly impact personal computing. “In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,” Osterloh said on stage . “We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.”",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is working on a new “projects” feature for Gemini. We expect the new Gemini feature to function similarly to ChatGPT’s projects. Gemini’s projects functionality was first spotted in August and may be released soon. Google’s cooking up a new Gemini feature to bring its AI platform more in line with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. As first reported in August by TestingCatalog on Twitter, Gemini has been prepping new “projects” functionality to go toe-to-toe with ChatGPT’s offering of the same name. Now, we’ve seen evidence that the feature could be very nearly ready for prime time. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

By November of this year, 92% of upgrades and 85% of new activations are expected to be app-based. The aggressive shift risks alienating both customers and employees if the app experience falls short. Just yesterday, we learned that T-Mobile’s current CEO will be stepping down in November, signaling a shift to an AI-centric, digital-first future. At the time, I suggested this would likely mean customer service would move further away from retail, as well as human reps. Now, a new leak on Reddit suggests this ramp-up is coming sooner rather than later. According to an internal roadmap released by a disgruntled salesperson, nearly 100% of major customer service actions will be handled through the T Life app by the end of 2026. This includes new account setups, line additions, and upgrades.",

Many questions have been raised about the charging speeds of the Galaxy S26 series , particularly for the Ultra model. At one point, there was hope that Samsung would finally upgrade the Ultra in this department. However, those hopes were seemingly dashed after the phone was listed in a Chinese regulatory certification database. But a new rumor may rekindle that hope from before. Earlier this year, Samsung tipster Ice Universe confidently claimed that the Galaxy S26 Ultra would finally be the Samsung Ultra phone that breaks past 45W wired charging. The tipster even went as far as to say that the S26 Ultra would have the fastest charging speed in Samsung’s history.",

The Pixel 10 Pro spot, on the other hand, is far more ethereal, and is more about making an impression. Google does a lot of things very, very well, but you don’t have to be an iPhone fanboy to recognize that Apple is just running circles around the company when it comes to promotional efforts. Even at their best, Pixel ads tend to come across as quite odd, as we saw with the recent series of stop-motion “Best Phones Forever” spots surrounding the Pixel 10 ‘s launch. Now Google’s starting off this week with a couple new videos and they are just as weird as we’ve come to expect. The most stylistic, and arguably the more interesting ad here focuses on the Pixel 10 Pro and is at least ostensibly about the handset’s design:",

    "body": "Background The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) has reviewed flight, ground test, and published data on ultraviolet-induced degradation of silicone based thermal control coatings. Analysis has shown, for at least one silicone coating, that bake-out plays an important role in ultraviolet (UV) degradation, indicating that UV interaction with paint volatiles, and not the structural material, is the primary source of coating discoloration. Discussion Spacecraft temperature is primarily determined by the absorptivity and emissivity of the vehicle’s coating. Absorptivity is the fraction of the sun’s irradiance that is absorbed, and emissivity determines the amount of infrared power that is emitted. The combination of these properties, along with additional heat from internal sources and other external radiation sources, determines the spacecraft’s thermal environment. Choosing an appropriate coating, referred to as a thermal control coating, is key to keeping the vehicle within a desired temperature range. However, these coatings can degrade, (i.e., darken), in low earth orbit (LEO), primarily due to solar UV exposure, complicating the choice of coating. Zinc-oxide (ZnO) scatte…",

Email may have a reputation as being a bit clunky and inelegant compared to texting or DMs for quick conversation, but with it as broadly compatible as it is, we still find ourselves falling back to it over and over again. Sometimes it even feels almost as easy as texting, and you don’t even need to fully open an email to get all you need from it, and the info in your notification is more than enough. If that sounds like your experience, you’re going to be a big fan of Gmail’s new notification option. It’s been a couple months now, but this past summer we started getting reports from users about a new option showing up in Gmail notifications, no longer just letting you delete an email or start crafting a reply to it, but now letting you directly mark it as read , right from the notification. While we saw multiple Gmail users getting access, this was also far from generally available, and it looked like Google was still testing the feature out.",

Xiaomi has explicitly confirmed that users will no longer need proprietary chargers and cables for the fastest charging speeds. The move could pressure other Android manufacturers to abandon their own proprietary fast charging solutions and adopt universal standards. USB Power Delivery promised to be the holy grail of smartphone charging, but several Android OEMs chose to abandon the standard in favor of their own proprietary solutions for fast charging. Many Android flagships claim charging speeds as high as 100W-120W, but the fine print is that you need the proprietary charger to get those speeds. This trend could soon be a thing of the past, as a few upcoming Android flagships are confirmed to support 100W USB PD PPS charging. Xiaomi has confirmed that the upcoming Xiaomi 17 series is fully compatible with 100W PPS charging.",

We spotted an under-development feature that could utilize AI to generate titles for notes in Google Keep. Google Keep already lets you generate lists using text prompts. Google has been bullish on enriching existing features across its apps with AI. Simple text-based functionality consumes the least compute, which is why we’re seeing small additions creep up in several apps — in addition to Gboard’s writing tools . While messaging apps have largely been the focus for text generation or correction with AI, Google is also testing functions across other apps, and Google Keep is one of them. Now, Google is testing another AI-assisted feature in Keep notes to help craft better titles. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

The Find X9’s square camera bump is strikingly similar to the leaked OnePlus 15 design. Find X9 is also set to arrive in titanium-inspired colorways that have also leaked for the OnePlus 15. The OnePlus 15 is coming soon, and its updated design is already making rounds on the internet. Multiple rumors in the past have hinted at the redesigned camera bump on the upcoming flagship. And we recently came across purported hands-on images of the OnePlus 15 , which highlight the changes on the back. Although the authenticity of these images could not be ascertained, another teaser from earlier today suggests this change might be legitimate after all. The teaser does not come from OnePlus, but its parent company OPPO, which is set to unveil its flagship Find X9 series on October 16. That is just one day after the reveal of ColosOS 16, which has been confirmed to drive the OnePlus 15 in China. OPPO has been teasing the Find X9 series over the last couple of weeks.

This build shows tree, grass, and ragweed pollen levels on color-coded leaf icons, linking to Weather.com for details. The same version also refreshes the Weather app’s navigation buttons, borrowing design cues from iOS. Samsung Weather gives you most of the staples you expect from that type of app , like temperature, UV index, and so on. However, one notable omission of late has been pollen counts. For some reason, Samsung decided to get rid of the pollen tracker back in the One UI 7 days. Allergy sufferers quickly noticed the loss, as disgruntled posts on Reddit and Samsung’s own forums attest. At best, people could still dig into Weather.com through a buried link at the bottom of the app, but the dedicated pollen cards were gone. It looks like that might be about to change.

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR There’s a report of the Pixelsnap Ring Stand scratching the back glass of a Pixel 10 Pro. The scratch may be the result of dust or debris getting between the metal ring and the phone. The scratch appeared within 72 hours of using the ring stand on the device. The Pixelsnap Ring Stand has been making headlines lately, but for the wrong reasons. First, there was an issue with the screws becoming undone . Now, there’s a new issue that should be a little concerning for those who don’t put their phone in a case. When you choose to be a caseless user, you have to be extra cautious with how you handle your smartphone. Or else you risk your phone getting dinged up. But sometimes those risks come from unexpected places. Case in point, one Pixel 10 Pro owner was surprised when they found a scratch on the back of their phone presumably left by their Pixelsnap Ring Stand.",

Gemini appears to be working on a new mode that would infer when you’re talking about your screen, and then automatically analyze it. Google would also offer settings to disable this functionality, so Gemini would need explicit permission to look at your screen. How many different ways does Google give you to make sense out of what you’re seeing on your Android phone’s screen? You could open a screenshot in Lens if you were trying to be as clunky as possible, or just pull up Circle to Search for some quick analysis. Now we’ve also got Gemini ready to lend a hand, and its “Ask about screen” mode is already a deceptively powerful tool. Today we’re checking out one small way that Google could make this screen-searching solution even more streamlined.

TCL also plans to upgrade the existing QM8K with Gemini support. Gemini has already made some big strides to replace Assistant across Google’s ecosystem — plus just inject a fresh dose of AI assistance into corners that didn’t even have any yet. Right now we’re not just looking forward to the Gemini-fication of Google Home , but Gemini also coming to Google TV . Back in May, we learned that TCL would lead that charge as the first manufacturer to deliver a Gemini-equipped screen, and just the other week, we saw TCL introduce the QM9K , its first Gemini model. Now we’re finally getting the all-important details about how you can take one of these TVs home. TCL gets sales of the QM9K started in the US today, where you’ll be able to find the set available in four different sizes at Best Buy.",

Users can choose to allow Auto Blocker to automatically re-enable itself after 30 minutes of being turned off, balancing security and enthusiast needs. One UI 6 introduced Auto Blocker to Samsung Galaxy devices to keep users safe from various security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks. Users can block app installation from unauthorized sources, block commands and software updates through a USB cable, and even block malware images in messaging apps. It’s a good feature for the broader consumer base, but Auto Blocker can be annoying for enthusiasts since it blocks app sideloading . As a result, many power users choose to disable Auto Blocker entirely, which isn’t ideal. With One UI 8.5, Samsung is working on a compromise that works out for enthusiasts too, letting them choose to turn on Auto Blocker automatically after some time.

With the update, the Favorite tab is no longer visible in Now Playing. It’s an unwelcome change, especially as Google is preparing to overhaul Now Playing with a fresher design. “Now Playing” has been a small yet significant feature on the lock screen of Google Pixel devices. The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track. Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch. After Google recently pushed out the Android System Intelligence update, which bumped the version to B13 on eligible devices, Now Playing has lost one key feature. 9to5Google reported that it no longer shows a dedicated button for tracks marked…",
