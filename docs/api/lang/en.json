The sunny signposting has become a universal language for guiding players through levels, but it's also a regular point of contention in what some consider lazy game design. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi is the latest developer to weigh in on the debate after his own game was targeted for discussion in early 2024. \"I get there is a debate about that: whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don't,\" he said. \"I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game.\" I mean, yeah, Hamaguchi is largely stating the obvious here. For me at least, it's never about the inclusion of yellow paint itself, but how egregious it is—I took particular umbrage with its slapdash usage in Stellar Blade for example, which is one of the only games I've played where it's actively bugged me.

Among the crowd of iconic Warhammer 40,000 armies—your space marines, orks, tyranids, and more—these bird-like aliens are often overlooked. But I think they're secretly the coolest faction in the game. They've always been unfairly overshadowed. Starting life as a little one-off piece of art in the 1998 Warhammer 40,000 rulebook, their real introduction was in 2001, as a subfaction of the then brand-new T'au Empire. The anime-inspired T'au grabbed attention with their mech suits, drones, and giant railguns, but even back then I was enchanted by the humble Kroot. (Image credit: Games Workshop) Unlike most factions in Warhammer 40,000, the technologically-advanced T'au would rather absorb than destroy—they'll take over your world, but then they'll invite you to join their empire rather than wipe you out. The Kroot are their greatest success story—a seemingly crude and aggressive species that happily joined up and has been reaping the benefits of jolly cooperation ever since. Except… that's not quite what's happening. What motivates the Kroot most of all is food. Not be…",

Each time you level up Scrappy, he'll scrounge more basic crafting materials for you and can even nab a few rare items, too. He's a great ally early on, so why not reward Scrappy by training him?

Remix is also a novel way to level up an alt or two. See, once the event ends, your Remix characters will be converted into Retail characters—with Mists of Pandaria Remix, you could only do this after the doors were shut. But Legion Remix is novel in that you can transport your character at any time. Which, as the headline suggests, is part of the problem. See—in Remix events, your characters are able to get a (functionally) infinite power scaling through whatever doohickey The Infinite Dragonflight has set your time-traveller up with. Hence, all the hullabaloo about Gulp Frog farming in the MoP days . This time, it's Legion's artefact weapons.

Up front and centre, it claims NZXT and its partner in the Flex PC rental scheme , Fragile, \"conspired to defraud consumers through gross misrepresentations and illegal business practices.\" For the record, in the legal filing Fragile is described as \"a debt collection and payment services company that administers and manages the Program.\" The meat of the case appears to hinge on influencer-generated advertising that NZXT's CEO has himself conceded was not entirely \"factual.\" As per the filing, \"defendants knowingly disseminated grossly misleading advertisements and communications regarding the nature of the Program and the spe…",

Now, when you receive a \"potentially malicious\" message, Valve will add a \"suspicious chat warning that will appear at the top of the chat window.\" Given that Steam launched over two decades ago, and there were millions of dollars put into skins in games like Counter-Strike 2 , it's a bit of a surprise we didn't have this already. Players can emulate others through similar profile pictures or usernames, so it's not out of the question to think bad actors could fake credentials to get access to Steam users.

CEO and founder of 1X Tech Bernt Bornich announced the launch of pre-orders via X on Tuesday, but the price is far from the only thing giving me pause. Slated for a 2026 release, the Neo is pitched as a humanoid robot that will be able to take care of household chores autonomously. However, it looks like the Gamma could only just about put a glass into a dishwasher, so what strides has the Neo made since? Well, it turns out this robot has much to learn; Engadget reports that the Neo will lean heavily on tele-operation at least to begin with. In other words, you're not just welcoming Neo into your home, but potentially the 1X Tech employee piloting it remotely too.

You're tasked with finding a Field Depot location but not really told what one is besides being a camp with a blue tent—and that's misleading, actually. Below, I'll go over the Field Depot locations I've found on the Dam Battlegrounds map so you can complete the Off The Radar quest.

With such high stakes but great rewards on the line, it's important to know what you're getting into if you're contemplating sending your raider on an Expedition. Below, I'll go over how to go on an Expedition, everything you'll need to prepare, and what progress is kept and what's lost. Arc Raiders Expeditions explained (Image credit: Embark) Expeditions is Arc Raiders' approach to server wipes, giving you an optional way to retire your raiders and 'prestige' your account, losing most progression in the process. Expeditions have five main stages before reaching the final departure window, each requiring you to deliver different items and resources to build a caravan and prep it for travel. Only once you've completed these preparation steps can you officially send your raider on their merry way, never to be seen again. Importantly, Expeditions run on a roughly eight-w…",

Luckily, you can increase your chances of survival using the best skills . Unlike most extraction shooters, Arc Raiders actually has a full progression system with a skill tree that can soften the blow of a genre often obsessed with loot as the main form of progression—loot that you'll inevitably lose sooner or later. Below, I'll go over all the best perks in the skill trees that you should unlock. Best Arc Raiders skills (Image credit: Embark) There's a total of 45 unique skills in Arc Raiders, most with five upgrade levels, split between three distinct trees: Conditioning, Mobility, and Survival. In general, I'd recommend focusing on any skills that improve stamina efficiency, as it's required for sprinting and evading, and stamina is incredibly limiting early on. As you'd expect, this means you'll want to invest in the Mobility skill tree the most early on , especially as you need to spend points within a tree to unlock perks further in.

But what if I told you it doesn't have to be that way? That, for a small price, you could upgrade guns instead of simply relying on pure hope, luck, and a good bit of scavenging for higher rarity alternatives? Well, you can. Only after spending hours with Arc Raiders did I figure out that you can actually upgrade every single weapon you find or craft to a higher tier, finally explaining why guns have a Roman numeral next to their name. That terrible common Rattler I can become a slightly less terrible common Rattler II or even higher if you've got the necessary resources. I'll say, the Rattler, a go-to basic gun because it's cheap as chips, becomes much more usable when it's got a larger magazine, and that's exactly what upgrading this gun will do.

As gamers, we all get up in the morning, check the latest gaming news, download updates for the games we want to play, then spend five to six hours closely examining the specifications and technical drawings of the latest videogame patents. Amirite? OK, maybe videogame patents aren't at the forefront of our minds, but they do come up as a topic from time to time, especially due to some of the more, ahem, litigious game companies out there. And even when they're not in the news, it can be kind of fun to look through patents for various gaming tech and game systems, especially when it comes to the diagrams included in the patents. In that spirit, I've got a new quiz for you! I'll show you a diagram from a videogame patent, and you do your best to answer a multiple choice question about it. You can hit the Hint button to remove one of the wrong answers if you need a little help. Good luck!",

Namely, they're fed up with pop-ads for the new Season 1 battle pass, they're unhappy with the new map Blackwell Fields , and they're miffed that the only way to complete weekly challenges is to play battle royale, a mode that doesn't necessarily appeal to the folks who paid $70 for Battlefield 6 three weeks ago.

Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright . And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end : Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours ) but active development is over.

It's a bit more involved than a desktop pet, but brings me a more rewarding calm when I both want and do not want to do something. It plays a lot like the name suggests. You get a beefy hose, fancy attachments, and hop from client to client blasting grime off of surfaces, and that's its biggest appeal: just the raw, sensory satisfaction of stripping dirt off of things.

So they did! \"The two of them came in with their visual effects guy, and effectively they said to Kojima, 'We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?'

It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

Should an eagle-eyed shopper scoop a downright unreasonably priced bit of kit, it's often a toss up as to whether the supplier will either cancel the order, or quietly honour the few orders that get through before promptly updating the listing and acting like nothing happened. Either way, most companies would avoid making much noise about it. Apparently, London-based Gotraka isn't like most companies. One lucky Redditor spied an absurdly good deal on the black midi version of the Fractal Design North PC case . Gotraka normally sells this case for around £155 (about $205), but the poster snapped it up when it was briefly listed for only £20 (a little under $27). Gotraka not only honoured this incredibly low price, but even sent the buyer a note with their order. This read, \"We made a pricing mistake. You made it go viral. So we did what we believe is right—we owned it.\" Gotraka itself has since shared a blog post going into more depth about how the pricing mistake happened.

He calls it the Vera Rubin \"superchip\" and claims it contains no fewer than six trillion transistors. Yup, six trillion. In very simple terms, that means the Vera Rubin superchip sports 60 times the number of transistors of an Nvidia RTX 5090 gaming GPU . And that is a completely bananas comparison. What's more, the Vera Rubin superchip is capable of 100 petaflops of raw compute. And that is exactly 100 times more compute than Nvidia claims for its neat little DGX Spark AI box . Oh, and it packs 88 custom Arm cores suporting 176 software threads for conventional CPU compute, too. On a side note, that Arm CPU bit (which alone is known as Vera) is interesting from a PC perspective as you might expect its custom designed CPU cores, which notably support multi-threading, could turn up in a PC processor in the future. Watch this space. At this point you may be wondering how any of this is possible. Six trillion transistors, 100 PF of compute, 88 CPU cores, all in one chip? OK, Vera Rubin is expected…",

But here I am, after a press preview and the beta weekend, increasingly convinced that Embark Studio's third-person PvEvP has hit the nail on the head. I haven't had as long as I'd like with Embark's new extraction shooter, so this review is indeed in progress, with the final version coming sometime in the future when I've had a chance to properly experience it in all of its intersocial beauty. The premise of Arc Raiders is simple: the world has gone to hell thanks to robots and AI, so now all the humans are holed up in small communities underground, with you and other raiders occasionally popping up to the surface to gather resources to trade, create gear, and upgrade your base. On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff. You have to navigate these problems all while finding loot and extracting before the timer runs out. Escaping Tarkov Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark Studios) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: E…",

On the one hand, you can save the hostages by completing an elaborate puzzle, but it'll give Wiley more time to accomplish his objectives. On the other hand, you can leave the hostages to their fate—getting squished by a pneumatic press—but you'll reach Wiley faster and might be able to throw a spanner in his schemes.

The first dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit Elysium The answer to this is 4 .
