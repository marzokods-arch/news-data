Once you head to the right place, it's very similar to A Reveal in Ruins , i.e. a simple two step quest involving you finding a thing and bringing said thing back to the quest giver. If you want to make sure you get the item back in one piece, consider bringing a loadout with a safe pocket so you can immediately stow it in there. Otherwise, here's where to find Victory Ridge and how to complete the quest. How to complete Echoes of Victory Ridge in Arc Raiders Look for a broken section of highway just to the south of the first 'B' in West Broken Bridge (Image credit: Embark Studios) As mentioned, this quest is pretty straightforward.

I used it for quite some time, until the Google ecosystem became too all-encompassing to ignore. But over recent years, it seemed the yellow-tailed browser was becoming less privacy-focused after all, leaving it just like the other mainstream options. So it's good news, and perhaps vindication for those who were still holding out hope for Firefox, that it's expanding its fingerprint protections . By this, it means it's expanding its protections against websites linking you to a \"secret digital ID\" by \"collecting subtle details of your setup—ranging from your time zone to your operating system settings—that together create a 'fingerprint' identifiable across websites and across browser sessions.\" Fingerprinting is pretty much standard practice for many sites today. You should never assume that just because you don't have an official account on a website, it doesn't identify you between visits and so on, sometimes even regardless of stored cookies. From eyeballing the chart Mozilla presents, without any protections, over 60% of users appear unique to sites that fingerprint, and the…",

However, to thank the millions of people who have been jumping in , the team shared in a blog post that each player can expect a decent number of rewards. This includes 2000 Tix to unlock rewards in the battle pass and 500 SVBs to spend on whatever cosmetics you fancy for your character and board in the in-game store. The only catch is that the Tix needs to be used on the battle pass before the end of Season 1, which concludes in the first week of December. In a way though, these gifts feel less like a thank you and more like an apology for the shoddy state of the game and the number of issues that players have experienced since it launched.

Most notably, none of the decisions you make in the Witcher 3 are as momentous as the game-changing choice at the heart The Witcher 2, where choosing to help one of two characters in a fight led to a second act viewed from completely different perspectives. Roughly 90% of The Witcher 2's second-act strands are unique, each with its own locations, key characters, and quests. I've always wondered if CD Projekt will commit so wholly to an in-game decision again. But according to CD Projekt's co-CEO Adam Badowski, such an eventuality is unlikely. Speaking to PC Gamer, Badowski discussed the changes CD Projekt made between The Witcher 2 and 3, noting that the biggest of these was structural. \"In The Witcher 2, we had a very difficult structure of the game, because there are two paths. You can go one path and you won't see the other path,\" he says. \"From the production perspective it's a waste of resources. From [the] player's perspective, it…",

Simply put, I got fed up and decided to get to the root of the issue; I jotted down all 62 unique items I needed to find for quests, Scrappy and workshop upgrades, and the Expedition Project , which adds up to a staggering 1,195 materials you need to haul back to Speranza. Here's hoping my math skills haven't let me down. Nevertheless, in tallying this all up, I noticed a few interesting things. Firstly, you need to loot the drivers of every single Arc robot in the game right now besides a Queen. As you'd imagine, you generally need more of the basic Arcs' parts compared to the tougher ones, though you need six Bastion and Bombardier Cells, six Surveyor Vaults, and eight Leaper Pulse Units. I think it's safe to say we all hate fighting Leapers , and Surveyor drones are so skittish that they're hard to actually put down. So, if you get any of these items before their relevant upgrade task, hang on to them, or y…",

    "body": "Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida reckons that increasing confidence among Korean game developers is at least partly in thanks to Stellar Blade. Shift Up's soulslite did pretty well for itself when it hit consoles last year, with a further boost when the game made its way over to PC in early 2025. I had a good amount of fun with Stellar Blade myself— even if I found it a little uninspired in the face of similar concepts. But when it comes to Korean developers breaking out beyond niche MMOs and mobile games, I can't deny that Stellar Blade is one of the forerunners in broadening the region's reach. (Image credit: M Bowles via Getty Images) It's something that Yoshida agrees with, and even reckons that the game's success has bolstered spirits among Korean game developers, particularly when it comes to developing console games. As spotted by GamesRadar (via MiniMap ), the ex-PlayStation boss sat down with press ahead of game development conference G-Star to chat about the Korean indie scene, the role larger corporations play in helping them to thrive, and other console-y related bits. When asked about how the collaboration with Stellar Blade came about, Yoshida said: \"I visited …",

Patent Result values a company's quality over quantity and the strength of the ideas being brought to the table, so the ranking is based on both \"the quantity and relevance of their patents\". How do you measure that? Well, you take into account \"the frequency of a given patent being cited as a basis for the rejection of another company's patent\"—if one company's patent carries more weight, similar ideas are more likely to be rejected. While Bandai Namco was in the top three last year, it has moved up past mobile game developer Gree and taken SIE's crown, leading the way with 245 patents and a score of 8,565.2—which is a significant lead. Here are the patent scores for the top three: Bandai: 8,565.2 Sony Interactive Entertainment: 6,631.0 Gree: 5,121.9 The list is dominated by several familiar giants of the industry, such as Sega, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company.

    "body": "300 nits and 500 Hz. Pay close attention to those two numbers, because they give the new MSI MPG 271QR X50 's game away. Yup, this 27-inch, 1440p gaming monitor packs the very latest 4th gen Samsung QD-OLED panel technology. A new generation of OLED panel is always exciting, but how much of an upgrade is it over the best currently available OLED monitors ? Does it fix OLED's full-screen brightness limitations? What about QD-OLED's specific problems with ambient light and font rendering? What does a 500 Hz OLED actually look like set to full reheat? Hold those thoughts while we cover off this new display's various speeds and feeds. Along with the lofty 500 Hz refresh and 2,560 by 1,440 native resolution, you get OLED's characteristic uber-low response times, which come in at a claimed 0.03 ms. No question, this thing is built for speed. It's also engineered to be brighter than previous displays that rely on Samsung's QD-OLED technology. Right at the beginning of the year at the CES show, Samsung unveiled the next step in its QD-OLED roadmap . It's taken a little while for that to show up in PC monitors as opposed to TVs, but it's finally landed at PCG towers. MSI MPG 271QR X50 spec…",

    "body": "It's been nearly two years since I reviewed the Kinesis Gaming Freestyle Edge RGB , but it's still been our top pick for the best ergonomic gaming keyboard you can buy. While there are arguably more ergonomic options on the market, or simply ones with more gaming features, the Freestyle Edge is a near-perfect blend of comfort, performance, and price tag. Well, it's back again, this time in the form of a small update: the Freestyle Edge RGB Plus . When I say small, I really do mean small, because Kinesis Gaming has only changed a handful of aspects of the original package. First up are the key switches, which have been swapped from Cherry MX to Gateron Pro v1. This was probably done for cost reasons, but the good news here is that whatever money Kinesis has saved by using different mechanical switches, it's spent it on the lift kit (which tents the keyboard) and Apple Mac modifier keycaps. These used to be optional extras (and quite pricey, too), but now they're included in the box.

Arc Raiders is an intentionally hefty shooter that rewards positioning and stealth over lightning-quick reflexes, but players are still finding techniques that speed you up or assist a daring escape. If you want to add a little spice to your raids, you can and should learn the ways of the ledge grab . By holding spacebar as you fall, your raider will catch any nearby ledge and hoist up. The timing is generous, and it doesn't seem to matter how far or fast you're falling before you grab the ledge. With a little practice, and an eye for what is and isn't a valid ledge, you can confidently start jumping off somewhat large gaps without worrying about fall damage. String a few grabs together and you can even quickly descend a tall building . The tricky part is that chaining grabs together requires letting go of a grab before you climb the ledge. Of course, you can also take it to extremes by leaping off a cliff, crossing your fingers, and aiming for something to grab—like in this clip below, where a street light turns into a quick-descent elevator. There's so much sick movement tech in this game! The po…",

Something I didn't get too deeply into when I gushed about Tavern Keeper last week is its item design tool. There are all sorts of objects to build in your tavern, from useful furniture like tables, chairs, and beds to decorative items like bookcases, paintings, and rugs—but that's just the start. Tavern Keeper also invites players to modify existing items or create their own with its in-game design tool and share them with other players. I've only done some basic modifications so far, like decorating countertops with items like gold coins, goblets, playing cards, and perhaps a dagger half-buried in the wood of a table.

Many of the games that are in the running for one of our Game of the Year awards aren't represented, including Elden Ring Nightreign, Battlefield 6, Europa Universalis 5, Arc Raiders, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Those games all received favorable scores by our standards, just not quite favorable enough to pass the bar I've set here, which is 89%-and-up. Clair Obscur received what was probably our most controversial score of the year at 70% —still a recommendation for the French RPG, though not the shining praise it got elsewhere. (Including from some of PCG's other writers.) Reviews aren't a measure of popularity or an attempt to arrive at the average opinion, so I don't consider these notable absences a bug. There's a lot to appreciate about the two most-played new games right now, Battlefield 6 ( 82% ) and Arc Raiders ( 86% ), but to get a really high score, a game has to inspire an individual reviewer to go out on a limb and champion it, perhaps even pushing back on editors whose responsibility it is to ask, \"OK, but is it actually a 92%?\" As 2025 draws to a clos…",

Another expert noted that its tone resembled \"a high-school drama club's Elizabethan improv night.\" That sounds pretty bad. As a result, Silksong's Steam rating briefly fell to \"mostly negative\", and ever since a fan group called Team Cart Fix has been working away in the background to improve the Chinese translation. The fruits of their labour have been available as an unofficial mod for a while, but now, in Silksong's new Patch 4, the work of Team Cart Fix has been officially implemented in the game. \"Their translation builds from elements of the original Silksong translation, retaining existing names for most characters and places, except in instances where the original translation was incorrect, or inconsistent with Hollow Knight,\" Team Cherry writes . \"Most importantly, this is a translation by fans who are well-v…",

In a recent interview with Diablo 4 streamer Rob2628 , the developers gave a pretty clear hint on when the expansion news will finally arrive. Rob brought up an image recently datamined from the game that reads December 12 in Chinese, which happens to be the same day (taking time zones in account) as this year's The Game Awards show. He asked associate game director Zaven Haroutunian and lead live game designer Colin Finer if Diablo fans should watch it.

As promised by DICE lead producer David Sirland last week, the quality-of-life update will address the gun dispersion issues, incorrect vehicle spawns, the unstoppable lock-on missile , and most notably, the \"drone hammer\" bug that let players levitate on command. That last bug fix could be a particularly big ideal, as folks were using the levitation exploit to get high up on maps that have no air vehicles and land on out-of-bounds rooftops on Siege of Cairo. This is also the first major update for Redsec, Battlefield 6's free-to-play battle royale mode. That knocks a few big problems off the to-do list, though to be honest, my biggest gripes with Battlefield 6 are problems that will take a lot longer to address: the lack of big maps and the terrible UI. Sirland acknowledged both topics in his AMA last week, but gave no timeline or indicated they were huge priorities. The good news is we're getting one new big map next week: Eastwood . Update 1.1.1.5 arrives on November 11 at 9 AM UTC. Here are the full patch notes: PLAYER Fixed an issue where dispersion would be higher than intended when going from sprint t…",

The many different ways you play and participate in ARC Raiders have completely blown us away, going far beyond what we ever imagined. You surprise us, you outsmart us, and you keep us on our toes.

Typically we're limited to seeing concurrent player counts on Steam alone, but this includes raiders on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S as well.

He is a Man very self evidently made of Bones, so we're not exactly solving a riddle for the ages here. Still, Arabella's patter with Withers is a charming, unexpected bit of writing that punches above its weight in shading more depth into both characters: Withers clearly has a soft spot for children, and Arabella has no problem chopping it up with an immortal watcher. Seeing more of that relationship is certainly welcome. After finding Arabella's dead parents but before telling her about their fate, she was supposed to have a brief back-and-forth with Withers at the party camp where she tweaks his nose and settles on the Bone Man nickname. \"I am not a 'skellie,' thou shalt call me Withers,\" the reluctant avatar of cosmic judgement peevishly intones. \"'Withers?'

The anniversary has got Bethesda creative chief Todd Howard in a reflective mood, and he's revealed some interesting details about the creation of the game and what the RPG maestros learned from it. One of the main things Bethesda learned is that cinematic, Mass Effect-style dialogue systems are a bad fit for Bethesda games. In an interview with GQ , Howard was asked what he thought the best game he'd worked on is. Responding diplomatically, Howard pointed to several features of multiple games, while also mentioning that some things \"didn't resonate\" with players. After a bit of coaxing, Howard revealed that Fallout 4's dialogue system was one of them. \"We spent forever on the dialogue system in Fallout 4,\" Howard said. \"'How do we do an interactive conversation in an interesting way? How do we make that gamey? But it really did not resonate. It was also hard on our designers to write that way.\" Elaborating on why the dialogue system didn't resonate, Howard explained …",

But BG2 didn't emerge in a vacuum, and in a recent chat with Slandered Gaming it emerged that—while we can thank BG2 for a lot of our favourite RPGs since—we have a whole other game to thank for BG2. That'd be Final Fantasy 7, which lit a fire under BG2 director James Ohlen to go all out with the game's structure and companions, per Trent Oster—who worked on the original Baldur's Gate and has since become CEO of Beamdog, the studio behind the BG1 and BG2 Enhanced Editions. \"So, James had played Final Fantasy 7, and they had character interaction and romance, and he was scared shitless,\" recalls Oster.

As obvious as it sounds, it's worth pointing out that you get these Firing Cores from Arc Sentinels, which are sniper turrets attached to ceilings in just a few specific locations, and are different to the regular turrets you commonly encounter. You're less likely to run into these naturally compared to almost all other Arc types. With that in mind, tracking them down for their cores proves to be a time-consuming task.
