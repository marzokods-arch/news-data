    "body": "The late Grateful Dead legend Bob Weir will be remembered in his hometown, San Francisco, this weekend with a special tribute to his life and career. “Homecoming: Celebrating the life of Bobby Weir”&nbsp;will move through SF this&nbsp;Saturday, Jan. 17&nbsp;at&nbsp;Civic Center Plaza, starting at 3:45pm ET. The free public gathering will remember Weir, whose “music, spirit and humanity shaped generation,” reads a statement from organizers. “Together, we will pay tribute in the community and collective heartbeat that he created.” Weir, the guitarist and jam-band pioneer who co-founded the Grateful Dead and continued their legacy in the 21st century with Furthur, Dead &amp; Company and more, died last week due to underlying lung issues after fighting cancer. He was 78. Reps say this weekend&#8217;s special gathering is not a concert and there will be no live performances, but will instead center on “gratitude, remembrance, and togetherness,” along with special tributes to honor the late artist. Also, a procession will travel three blocks down Market Street between 7th and 9th Streets at approximately 3:30pm ET. View this post on Instagram &#8220;Homecoming: Celebrating the life of B…",

A move to the United States proved to be a shrewd one, as Chapman went on to produce Blondie’s classic&nbsp; Parallel Lines &nbsp;(from 1978), housing the global smash “Heart of Glass.” Chapman kept the hits coming by producing Get The Knack (1979), home to the Knack’s blistering “My Sharona,” and through the 1980s he co-wrote a long list of smashes with Holly Knight, including “Love Is a Battlefield” (Pat Benatar), “Better Be Good to Me” and “The Best” (Tina Turner).

    "body": "TL;DR Google is redesigning the Trends Explore page to add a pop of color and support more search term comparisons. The new look also adds a Gemini sidebar that can suggest and analyze search term performance based on a broader topic. Google’s upgraded Trends Explore page is starting to roll out now for desktop users, but the gradual rollout could take weeks to reach everyone. Google Search data is paramount in determining what topics, people, and questions users find important . Google hosts a tool called Google Trends that anyone can use to discover the search queries and topics that are currently trending. It’s especially useful for researchers, content creators, and journalists, but there are a handful of ways the average Google user can tap into these metrics, too. Google announced today, January 14, that it is redesigning the Trends Explore page — and the new look adds a Gemini sidebar for the first time. The upgraded Trends Explore page uses Gemini to help users compare data across multiple related search terms. Instead of combing through similar search queries manually, users can have Gemini identify and compare topical trends. These are compiled automatically based on you…",

Verizon is experiencing a significant outage today, with thousands of users from across the country taking to service availability monitor Downdetector to report that their Verizon service isn’t working.

Downdetector’s outage report graphs for T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Google, US Cellular, Amazon Web Services, and more all spiked at the same time as Verizon’s, starting just before noon Eastern time today. Reports of Verizon outages far outweighed reports for other services, however: Verizon saw nearly 200,000 reports at the peak of the outage around 12:30 PM, Eastern, while T-Mobile and AT&amp;T each had less than 2,000 reports around the same time.",

The game is an origami simulator called “Kami.” The project is free, available online, and it’s open-source, so anyone can use or modify it. With the extra screen real estate that foldable phones, like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 , provide, they make for great mobile gaming devices. The unique folding design of foldables also presents an opportunity to interact with games in a new way. On that end, we’re starting to see developers find ways to incorporate a folding phone’s hinge into the gameplay, like the viral Foldy Bird game . Now, another game has emerged with a rather clever idea. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

In the case of the KONKR Pocket FIT Elite, the company says memory prices nearly tripled, causing AYANEO to lose money on the device. In a detailed post on Indiegogo , AYANEO confirmed that the Pocket FIT Elite is still expected to begin shipping in March after the Chinese New Year shutdowns. While that timeline broadly matches what the company said in late December , the update goes much further by explaining exactly why the Elite model ran into trouble in the first place.",

Heavy, uncomfortable to wear, and worst of all, featuring a low-res, blurry screen, it coasted by on sheer novelty.

A very public incident involving the Samsung Galaxy Ring saw a user sent to hospital after the ring swelled on his finger while he was about to board a flight. It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR Google has introduced Personal Intelligence in Gemini, allowing the AI to remember your personal details by connecting to your Google apps. Gemini can now think across your data, not just pull a single email or photo on command. Instead of stuffing everything into the model, Gemini selectively surfaces only the most relevant info when needed. The feature is now live for US Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, with plans to expand further. Google is finally tackling a common frustration with AI assistants: their tendency to forget personal details. Starting today, Gemini is getting a memory upgrade called Personal Intelligence. This new feature lets the AI access your Google apps, like your emails and photos, so it can give answers that feel much more relevant to you. This new feature is now rolling out in beta. Instead of making you jump between Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube, Gemini can now bring all that information together. If you choose to opt in, Gemini can access your Google apps and use that information in real-time, making your personal data more useful.",

You get granular control over the animations, allowing you to tweak the speed, direction, distortion, and even the physics of the movement. You can also override the system’s auto-brightness for the Always On Display as part of the update. For all the power packed into our Galaxy phones, the act of unlocking them has felt pretty utilitarian for a while. You tap, the screen turns on, and that’s it. It works, but it’s not very exciting, except for the new fingerprint unlocking animations that arrived last year. If you’re using the latest One UI 8.5 beta, though, that quick moment is about to get a lot more interesting. Samsung has released a quiet update to its LockStar module. As per a post on X by tipster Ice Universe, the latest version (8.5.00.8) brings fully customizable unlock animations, meaning you now have several transition effects that make unlocking your phone feel smooth and intentional.",

The phones could detect when you’re arranging a meeting in a messaging app and warn you if this clashes with calendar events. There’s no word if this will be an on-device AI feature or if it requires an internet connection. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 phones have a variety of Galaxy AI features , ranging from call transcripts and summaries to generative image editing and writing tools. Now, it looks like the Galaxy S26 series could receive another neat AI-based addition. Leaker Ahmed Qwaider claimed on Twitter that the Galaxy S26 series could tell you when you’re in danger of double-booking yourself. More specifically, the phones will apparently detect when you’re arranging a meeting/appointment in WhatsApp, Instagram, or SMS and warn you via a notification if this appointment clashes with any events already in your calendar.",

The update isn’t out yet, and the existing version also appears half-baked, suggesting some wait time before it arrives for users. Remix is one of the most exciting features in Google Photos . You can recreate your existing images in different art styles or let Nano Banana transform them into entirely new ones with you in the spotlight. Google already offers a range of presets to let you quickly remix your images using templates, such as for professional headshots or a Christmas-themed scene. It is natural to expect that more templates will be added over time, which could make it difficult to arrange them. Thankfully, Google is experimenting with ways to sort Remix templates so they’re easy to access. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

The Galaxy S26 series has been one of the most confusing upcoming launches. We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",

If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",

While the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled in favor of AT&amp;T, the 2nd Circuit ruled in favor of the government over Verizon. The Supreme Court is now being asked to step in and make a final ruling that will apply to both, though the decision won’t likely arrive until the summer of 2026. After it determined Verizon and AT&amp;T had willfully violated the law by failing to protect customer location data, the FCC previously ordered AT&amp;T and Verizon to pay roughly $57 million and $47 million, respectively. While both companies paid the fines as expected, they also opted to sue over the matter independently. Now the Supreme Court is getting involved as well, as reported by The Hill .
