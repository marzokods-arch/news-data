You cannot conduct a conversation about AI without someone quickly bringing up the inconvenient topic of mistakes. For as useful as these systems can be when it comes to organizing information, and as impressive as the content is that generative AI can seemingly pull out of nowhere, we don’t have to look far before we start noticing all the blemishes in this otherwise polished facade.

We’ve reached out to Google for clarification about what exactly the icon means and what affected users should do. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold was released just a couple of weeks ago, and as it often goes, problems are cropping up now that it’s in the wild. Namely, multiple users are reporting an unexplained battery issue that might require a warranty claim. PiunikaWeb spotted that a significant number of users are reporting their Pixel 10 Pro Fold has stopped reliably reporting its battery status. Multiple users on the Pixel Fold subreddit, posting as far back as the day after the phone’s launch (user raremagicien ) and as recently as yesterday (user dancemiasma ), say that a question mark has appeared next to the battery icon on their new Pixel 10 Pro Folds.",

An Infoblox report states that it behaves like malware, with keylogging features and disabled security tools. The browser has reportedly been downloaded millions of times, with ties to illegal gambling sites. A web browser claiming to keep your data safe may be doing exactly the opposite. According to a new investigation, an app called Universe Browser, which has reportedly been downloaded millions of times, surreptitiously installs dangerous software and routes your internet traffic through servers in China. The findings were reported by Wired , which reviewed a study shared with it by cybersecurity firm Infoblox and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The researchers say the ‘privacy browser’ behaves a lot like malware, with features that resemble keylogging, secret connections to external servers, and background activity that alters device settings. It even blocks features like right-click menus and developer tools, and disables key browser security protections.",

Despite some valid points, the campaign may not be enough to overcome AT&amp;T’s weaker performance in regions where T-Mobile and Verizon dominate. While Verizon and T-Mobile seem engaged in an active and dynamic battle for our cellular souls, AT&amp;T is a bit different. It continues to build out a stable cellular and fiber network and has even managed a few important acquisitions, but it does it in a way that’s much quieter and pretty boring on the surface. Now it seems it’s finally ready to make a little noise, as AT&amp;T has announced a massive new campaign designed to go after T-Mobile for its so-called “Untruths”.

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR The latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) now requires Google Play Services, causing crashes on de-Googled systems like GrapheneOS. The app fails to launch because it can’t find a font that’s only provided through Google Play Services. Users can fix the issue by rolling back to an older version (9.9.106.773153235.19) of the app or by using sandboxed Play Services on GrapheneOS. Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up. We’ve since learned why that dependency exists, and the reason is surprisingly trivial.",

Users were unable to log in, creators lost their pre-launch efforts, and order numbers were shuffled. Existing campaigns also saw prices increase mid-campaign as exchange rates were recalculated. Indiegogo is one of the most popular crowdfunding platforms, hosting everything from Android gaming handhelds to creepy AI pets . However, a recent change has significantly impacted the public image of the platform, affecting both buyers and creators. Earlier this year, Indiegogo was purchased by the board game crowdfunding platform Gamefound. At the time, it was announced that the two would remain independent but have new integrations. For example, login credentials would be shared across both sites, and Indiegogo would soon switch to Gamefound’s “proven technology” on its website.",

For an open-source project so laser-focused on delivering a private Android experience, the dependency on Google feels paradoxical. There are good reasons for this, of course — Google is the only major phone maker that’s generous enough to let you install alternative operating systems. But luckily, that might not be the case for much longer. After years of being limited to just one hardware platform, the team behind GrapheneOS has confirmed they’re working with a “major Android OEM” to bake in official support for the operating system.",

Users can fix this by rolling back to version 9.9.106.773153235.19 of the app. Users on Reddit point out that if you’re running a sandboxed Google Play Store and Play Services on your Pixel with GrapheneOS, you’ll still be able to use the latest version of the Pixel Camera app. Google’s latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) apparently doesn’t play nice with privacy-focused operating systems. According to a report from Kuketz Blog , the new Pixel Camera app now has a hard dependency on Google Play Services. That means if you’re using GrapheneOS or another de-Googled system, the app will probably crash or fail to launch entirely.",

    "body": "TL;DR The launch price of the Galaxy XR is $1,799.99, but adding the controllers and case brings it to around $2,300. That’s still far less than the Apple Vision Pro’s $3,499 launch price, and Samsung’s throwing in freebies worth up to $1,000 for early adopters. But is it fair, overpriced, or good value for a first-gen headset? Cast your vote below. Last night’s Galaxy XR launch finally kicked off Samsung’s long-teased push into Android-powered extended reality. At $1,799.99, it’s not exactly an impulse buy, and what might be harder to swallow for some is that if you want both the controllers and the travel case, you’ll be looking at another $500 on top , bringing the full package to roughly $2,300. The question is, has Samsung got this pricing right? While that’s a lot of money for most people, it’s hard for us to judge whether it’s overpriced, about right, or even good value. This is always the issue with the first generation of a new device category. The obvious comparison to make is with the Apple Vision Pro, which first launched more than 18 months ago and was priced at $3,499. That’s for the base storage model, with the cost rising to $3,899 for the highest storage capacity …",

Back in April, we found evidence that YouTube was working on a new feature aimed helping users limit their time watching Shorts videos . Code in a beta version of the YouTube app included mentions of a new timer system that’d stop users from scrolling through the Shorts feed once a predefined timer had expired. Now, that feature is rolling out. TechCrunch spotted this morning that YouTube announced a new daily time limit option for scrolling through Shorts. Once you set up that timer, you’ll get a “dismissable prompt” telling you that Shorts scrolling is paused. Shorts will still appear in other parts of the app, but once you’ve reached your limit, the main Shorts feed will remain disabled until the next day (assuming you don’t just dismiss the timer prompt, anyway).",

Several users report that their phones have changed from orange to a rose gold hue, possibly due to solvent use or UV exposure. Apple has quietly replaced affected units. Official response is still pending. The iPhone 17 series is one of Apple’s most successful releases in recent times. Despite the phones being available for over a month now, many models are still routinely out of stock, indicating continued strong demand. Case in point, the new Cosmic Orange color on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max still has a shipping wait time of one to three weeks, depending on the storage variant. The saturated orange color is catching the fancy of many users, but if you have one or are considering buying, you should be aware of the possibility that it may turn rose gold, potentially by accident.
