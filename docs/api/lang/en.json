Android Auto offers a cool feature called Google Assistant actions, allowing you to create specific commands and place shortcuts to them in the app drawer. That means you can quickly call a contact, get a traffic report, and more with a single tap. We know that Gemini is coming to Google’s automotive platform , and we’ve uncovered evidence that this Assistant feature will get a Gemini upgrade.

Samsung Health already lets users manage prescriptions and store health records in the app. Samsung already offers a broad spectrum of health metrics for users of its Galaxy Watch or Ring. These metrics, including complex ones such as AGEs and antioxidant indexes, or much more common ones such as ECG and hypertension alerts, already paint a comprehensive picture of a user’s health. While this data is generated from wearables’ stats and calculated using algorithms, Samsung is paving the way for more personalized care right from your device. The Korean giant is taking a significant step towards telehealth with a new feature on Galaxy smartphones and tablets. It recently announced a partnership with HealthTap, a US-based virtual healthcare provider, allowing users to seek opinions from medical professionals without physically visiting a clinic or hospital.",

A T-Mobile card has been rumored for months, with reports in April suggesting a Capital One–backed Visa was in development. This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",

Google denied the reports of a Gmail security event, claiming that people misunderstood the compilation of breached login credentials. The company recommends users enable two-factor authentication and use passkeys to keep their accounts secure. Infostealer databases help consumers get a grasp on whether their personal data and account information has been leaked in a data breach. However, they can occasionally steer users in the wrong direction. Multiple news outlets reported this week that a massive Gmail leak exposed over 183 million passwords, but Google is now publicly refuting those claims. “Reports of a ‘Gmail security breach impacting millions of users’ are false,” Google explained in a thread on X (via Engadget ). “Gmail’s defenses are strong, and users remain protected.”",

Update: October 28, 2025 (2:15 PM ET): In response to our original article below, a Google spokesperson reached out to us with the following statement: Gemini for Home (including AI descriptions, Home Brief, and Ask Home) is in early access so users can try these new features and continue giving us feedback as we work to perfect the experience. As part of this, we are investing heavily in improving accurate identification. This includes incorporating user-provided corrections to generate more accurate AI descriptions. Since all Gemini for Home features rely on our underlying Familiar Faces identification, improving this accuracy also means improving the quality of Familiar Faces. This is an active area of investment and we expect these features to keep improving over time.",

User reaction so far is largely positive, although the update did unpair Bluetooth devices for some users. It was less than two weeks ago that we learned the Fairphone 4 would skip Android 14 altogether with a jump straight to Android 15 , and things are moving quickly. Rewarding owners for their patience after last year’s software delay, the company previously stated that the upgrade would start arriving “from early November onwards.” Fairphone seems to be ahead of schedule this time around, with Android 15 already rolling out on the device. A Fairphone employee confirmed on the company’s Community Forum that the phased rollout would begin on October 27, and the update is now reaching some users. It includes the October security patch and weighs in at around 1.6GB, depending on your existing version. The rollout is still phased, so those who haven’t received it yet should expect a notification in the coming days and weeks.",

Instead of flooding the market with free-phone offers that require no trade-in, AT&amp;T focuses on consistent discounts that usually extend to both new and existing customers. That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches, of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device.

The Pocket G2 ships this week, while the more powerful Pocket 6 won’t ship until January Retroid just announced its new lineup of handhelds yesterday, and we didn’t have to wait long to buy them. Whereas companies like AYANEO and AYN tease handhelds for weeks or even months before they go to market, the Retroid Pocket G2 and Pocket 6 are already up for sale on the official website. That said, only one is truly close to shipping, and that’s the Pocket G2. As the name implies, it’s the first Android gaming handheld with Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 processor, which should be significantly more powerful than the Snapdragon 865 on the Pocket 5. We were very impressed with the performance on the cheaper G1 Gen 2 SoC found on the Retroid Pocket Classic , but stay tuned for full G2 Gen 2 testing in the coming weeks.",

This would be a dramatic and overdue increase in battery capacity for the Z Fold family. The phone is also tipped to offer S Pen support and a reduced display crease. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best foldable phones of 2025, and that’s largely due to its cutting-edge design. However, the Z Fold 7 retains a 4,400mAh battery for the fifth straight generation, while Samsung also nixed S Pen support. There might be good news for the Galaxy Z Fold 8, though. Dealsite (via Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that the Galaxy Z Fold 8 could have a battery larger than 5,000mAh. This would be much bigger than the Z Fold 7’s 4,400mAh battery.",

Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector. The headset’s tethered battery connects with a proprietary pin system, opening up the USB-C port for use with other accessories.",

Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

Cover screen advertisements are scheduled to start showing up next week or later. You’ll have the option to dismiss these advertisements or turn the widget off. Last month, some Samsung Family Hub smart refrigerator owners began pointing out something peculiar about the update they received. The changelog for the update mentioned that the cover screen would begin displaying advertisements, among other information. A new update is now rolling out that will bring this to all Family Hub fridges with screens above a certain size.

The preview is available for Fitbit Premium users with a Pixel Watch or Fitbit device (Android first). The tool offers AI-driven guidance on fitness, sleep, and health through a chat interface. Google is officially putting health-focused AI to work on users’ wrists. Beginning October 28, the company will open a public preview of its Gemini-powered Fitbit Personal Health Coach for Fitbit Premium users in the US. The feature was first announced in August, when Google launched the Pixel Watch 4 . It uses Gemini’s conversational smarts to blend fitness training, sleep analysis, and general health advice into a single chat-based experience. Rather than simply a new feature, the rollout represents a test drive of Google’s broader vision of personalized wellness, coinciding with a complete Fitbit app overhaul. The app’s redesigned interface divides everything into four tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep, and Health , and shifts the focus from daily streaks to long-term progress.

While we’ve generally been fans of the changes, not every swing in this Expressive direction is going to be a hit. And even though we saw Google take a very slow, measured approach to deploying these updates, some of those less-than-successful tweaks have managed to slip through to public releases. The good news is that Google is learning from your feedback, and already appears to be correcting just such an oversight.

While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR The ARMSX2 emulator for Android has just received its V1.0 release on GitHub, with a Play Store release coming later this week. The app differs from NetherSX2 due to its open-source nature and its use of a more recent foundation. NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution. Fortunately, the ARMSX2 emulator has been in testing for a while, and it’s finally received a version 1.0 release. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
