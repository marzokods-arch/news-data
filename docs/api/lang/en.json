I know that for many gamers, it delivered the hyperfast bullet ballet they'd always wanted, but for me, it simply felt that far too much of Doom's DNA had been sacrificed in order to deliver it. Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed. A more grounded (literally) take on the classic FPS formula that, to me at least, felt far more like a spiritual successor to the legendary 1993 original. And now, thanks to id Software's 35th anniversary celebrations, Doom: The Dark Ages is over two-thirds off.

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules. As the memory supply crisis went further and further into the red, it became clear that a VRAM-stuffed Super refresh in the coming months was unlikely. The RTX 50-series cards we've tested to da…",

In a post on X , Vincke said that \"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures,\" so a series that builds on them makes perfect sense. Even more promising, despite Larian having no official involvement with the series, Mazin and co are apparently in touch with the studio: \"Craig did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us,\" wrote Vincke. \"From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope.\" Hooray!

Spoilers ahead for Fallout season 2 At the end of the first season, the levels for each of our main characters were slightly skewed, or at least not where you'd expect them to be. Despite being the main character, Lucy only managed to get to level 8, while The Ghoul sat somewhere around level 89, and Maximus managed to reach level 9.

According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3.

One of the easiest methods is using slottable skills you'll find from chests or get by completing various activities. However, you can only activate so many before you run out of skill capacity . There are three types of skills—general, samurai, and ninja—and each one is increased separately. Luckily, it's not all too tricky to increase your skill capacity, though the boosts are somewhat small and incremental. How to increase your skill capacity in Nioh 3 Team Ninja Team Ninja Team Ninja You can increase your skill capacity in Nioh 3 by finding texts or memorandums through trading with Sudama, reaching exploration milestones in each region, and as rewards for activities , such as valuable chests. Texts increase their respective skill capacity by one, while you'll need four memorandums of the same type before they'll add an extra point.

In fact, there are two not far from where you enter the Tenryu River. If you walk up to these glowing spots, you won't be able to interact with them whatsoever, with the map explaining that you don't have a compatible Guardian Spirit. It's rather annoying as these Spirit Veins prevent you from accessing some of the last activities you've got to tick off in this area, and you'll find even more Spirit Veins later. Below, I'll explain how Spirit Veins work and how to get the compatible Guardian Spirits you need. How to access Spirit Veins in Nioh 3 Team Ninja Team Ninja There are different types of Spirit Veins, and to use them, you need to unlock the corresponding Guardian Spirit by progressing through the main story. For example, after beating Jakotsu-baba and clearing the Crucible at Hamamatsu Castle, you'll unlock Enko, a fire tiger Guardian Spirit. This unlocks Gale Sprint, but what you're not told is that you can now also channel this Guardian to use wall-running Spirit Veins, which are common in later areas like Lake Sanaru. You don't need…",

    "body": "Guerrilla Games' long-rumored Horizon co-op game has finally been unveiled as Horizon Hunters Gathering , a tactical action game for up to three players who will step into the roles of powerful hunters to defend the world from an onslaught of deadly machines. Horizon Hunters Gathering, in case it's not abundantly clear, isn't the conclusion of the Horizon trilogy that some fans have been hoping for. \"It's something new,\" Guerrilla studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said in today's announcement video. \"It stands on its own.\" Aloy, hero of the mainline games, makes a cameo appearance in the video, but the game itself will feature a roster of different hunter heroes, each with unique abilities: tank, sniper, stealth, and so forth. (Image credit: Guerrilla Games) Combat in Horizon Hunters Gathering \"is tactical, reactive, and skill-based,\" game director Arjan Bak says later in the video. \"We took the precision and tactical depth of Horizon's combat and built it for a team environment. You'll have to read enemy movement, time your attacks, and combine abilities with your squad to take down the most powerful machines. It is a challenging game. You really have to earn that victory.\" And w…",

So, Embark is doing things a little differently for its second Expedition project that departs on March 1. \"Starting off, we want to get one announcement out of the way right off the bat: we’ve heard your feedback about the required Stash value for maximum rewards being too high, and have decided to lower the requirement to three million Coins (600k per Skill Point),\" Embark wrote in blog post published today. \"The reward will still be five skill points for reaching the three million stash value.\" That's a big discount from the five million Coins that were needed to get the full skill point bonuses in the first Expedition—or a million coins per point. Yowza, now I understand the hate.

The shooter has a couple animal heroes already: Winston, a super-intelligent gorilla, and Wrecking Ball, a mech piloted by a hamster named Hammond. On the other hand, as Reddit user mikoga points out , those heroes are protected by powerful mechanized armor. Jetpack Cat is 90% just-a-cat. \"I don't want to shoot at a normal ass cat,\" mikoga said. I hadn't really considered it before seeing that comment, but I might also not want to shoot at a normal ass cat, although there are some compelling rebuttals in the thread. Hammond may be protected by a mech suit, notes one commenter, but his little hamster body sometimes spills out of the cockpit when he's eliminated. The mech also explodes a fair bit, as I recall. That does make it hard to claim that Jetpack Cat is an aberration: Overwatch has been annihilating furballs for some time now. Other arguments boil down to 'you won't feel bad once she's annoying the hell out of you.' Jetpack Cat …",

It is, by every measure (well, except that movie ) an unmitigated success. And apparently, Chris Metzen, the executive creative director of the Warcraft universe, sometimes wishes it had a different name. This interesting spot of trivia came out of a recent Game Business interview with World of Warcraft vice president and executive producer Holly Longdale and game director Ion Hazzikostas (via GamesRadar ), in which Longdale expressed a desire to do more with Warcraft, beginning with broadening its appeal. \"It’s a fantastic IP,\" Longdale sale. \"In my humble opinion, it’s been underutilized and I just want to bring it to as many people as possible.

That sounds like an awfully long time to me, but it seems to be the going rate for union contracts with Microsoft— Raven's QA workers also took three years to get theirs sorted. Fortunately, it all paid off in the end, because now 60+ workers are covered by the new agreement and it offers them a number of significant benefits. A statement provided by the Communications Workers of America—the union that represents the workers—confirms that the QA staff will have guaranteed wage increases; more regulations on AI and generative AI usage at work to ensure workers are supported, not replaced; protections on fair crediting; disability accommodations; immigrant worker protection; and restrictions on \"mandatory 'crunch time' or excessive overtime hours.\" All in all, this is…",

With a large shield, plenty of zone-controlling capabilities, and a railgun pistol, she's more than a rival to the long-reigning Sigma. Domina is one of five new heroes in The Reign of Talon's Season 1: Conquest update, which arrives on Tuesday, February 10, 2026, alongside Anran , Mizuki , Emre, and of course Jetpack Cat . Unfortunately, yes, Domina is the only new tank. Overwatch Domina's abilities (Image credit: Blizzard) Domina is a 650HP (mainly shields) tank hero, able to hold angles in a similar fashion to Sigma. While her large shield might look like any other, it's unique in that each part can be broken separately, making for a very strong barrier. She's classified as a Stalwart tank under the new subrole system, meaning she receives reduced knockback and slowing effects to help her hold space. Here are Domina's abilities: Ability Type Effect Photon Magnum Primary weapon A medium-range beam that builds into a high-impact shot.

With an included 2.4 GHz wireless receiver and intuitive Bluetooth mode, the G522 Lightspeed can be set up in seconds. It feels comfortable wrapped around the ears. The cushioned pads are spongy and airy, with enough padding, but not so much that you can't hit the frame with your finger with a press. The cups grip just enough to clamp onto the head without adding clamminess in the process. That comfort is enhanced by an adjustable headband sitting just below the plastic shell of the top of the headset. Unfortunately, that band only has two adjustable holes on either side, meaning there are only three adjustment settings total. That does mean if you have a particularly big head , you may find it a little tight. However, for me, I m…",

Burry took to his paid subscriber Substack page to declare that crypto was experiencing a \"collateral death spiral\", thanks to \"sky high leverage\" on crypto exchanges due to rising metal prices, which in turn meant that \"as the crypto collateral fell, the tokenized metals had to be sold\" (via Coindesk ).

But this time, he was told a price couldn't be confirmed and delivery would not be possible until February. Another supplier said they could deliver plates, but at a 40% higher price than before. Thermal Grizzly was paying around 190 euros per plate last year, with each plate enough to make four RTX 5080 GPU water cooling blocks.

    "body": "I'm of two minds about difficult games like Nioh 3 —one mind thinks that difficulty's a matter of accessibility, that there's really no harm in adding a setting so that someone (for any reason) is able to see a game through. The other half of me thinks that difficulty's often kind of the point, and can be a part of a game itself. I'm also one of those pretentious gits that thinks videogames don't have to be fun to be worth making or playing, though. Very much in the 'it's the point' camp is game director of Nioh 3 Masaki Fujita, who spoke with Eurogamer on the subject this week. In case you're unfamiliar, Nioh 3 is a soulslike action game with an emphasis on skill expression and difficulty. As contributor Lewis Parker puts it in his Nioh 3 review , it has a \"far more fine-tuned and in-depth approach to combat\", more Sekiro than Elden Ring. But that's getting into the weeds a little bit: Point is, it's a bit hard. Fujita tells the site that \"We've never considered adding difficulty settings to the Nioh series. The value of clearing the game is something that is unifying, and since Nioh 3 has even more variations on strategies to clear the game compared to previous games in the seri…",

Still, maybe you're a bit yippy, and need extra reassurance—even after a T2 press blast a few days ago—that Rockstar really means it , this time. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick hears your cries. In a recent chat with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Zelnick pointed out that, look, the company must be confident in the November 19 date, because it's spent all this goshdang money on marketing the game in the lead-up time. \"We have marketing beats coming this summer, and we don't spend money on marketing until we're pretty close to release,\" said Zelnick. To be clear, he means more than just putting out a slick trailer in the tail-end of 2023 . Think ads on buses, billboards, a never-ending feast of GTA 6 imagery jammed in your eyes and ears for months on end. It'll be fun! Asked if Take-Two really needs to bother marketing a game that's already bigger than god, Zelnick demurs that \"I think there's a difference between awareness and energy, and we need …",

That tech allows for rapid trigger and adjustable actuation—just like Hall effect does for keyboard, which massively reduces the time between you deciding to click and that on-screen gun firing. Though the Superstrike goes one further with haptic feedback, too. I got my hands on the mouse recently and I'm really impressed . However, it's not a cheap thing. It's set to launch on February 10 for $180 / £160 , which is even a little more expensive than the very expensive Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro , the best gaming mouse currently on the market. And given the Superstrike is aimed at competitive gameplay, I do worry that the advantage it gives might be restricted to only the very few who can afford it. Thankfully, though, while visiting its Swiss labs, Logitech helped somewhat quell my concerns on this front. Of course, the price tag for the Supestrike is what it is, but this is bleeding-edge tech, and it will hopefully become cheaper to implement, or be used in cheaper products in time.

YouTube channel Optimum has been using a 32-inch 4K LG WOLED monitor for around 3,000 hours over two years and has found only minor burn-in. This is a particularly handy metric given that one of the best known existing trackers of OLED burn-in by Monitors Unboxed has been based on a monitor with a Samsung QD-OLED panel . Now we have something similar for LG WOLED. For context, Optimum has been using an LG UltraGear 32GS95UV monitor for a wide range of uses, from gaming to content creation. I think it's a pretty much identical 4K model to the LG UltraGear 32GS95UE I reviewed here , complete with 1080p dual-mode. It's said the panel has been set to between 80% and 100% brightness depending on the time of day. No aggressive measures were taken to alleviate burn-in besides running Windows in dark mode with the taskbar set to autohide. All of the panel protection settings were left in default mode.

Logitech's X2 Superstrike is the first serious effort to bring such tech to a gaming mouse, and now that I've had my mitts all over it here at Logitech's Swiss labs, I reckon it stands a chance of shoving the esports scene forwards as Hall effect did with keyboards. The company announced the mouse late last year and since then I've been really excited to try it out, because I'm always on the lookout for something—other than diligent practice—that might improve my Counter-Strike 2 K:D ratio and headshot percentage, as well as my general performance in other shooters. The mouse uses what Logitech is calling a Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS), ie, a mix of haptic feedback and inductive tech for the LMB and RMB switches.

Anecdotally, I can well believe this figure, as YouTube's ad frequency ramped up at such a rate towards the end of 2025 that I finally caved and bought a YouTube Premium subscription myself. Speaking of which, while Alphabet doesn't report YouTube Premium's revenue individually, it has declared that the company now has \"over 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services, led by strong adoption for Google One and YouTube Premium.\" On the surface, YouTube's revenue figure seems impressive—but its viewing figures are even more so.
