I want, literally, to ask people to f&#8211;kin’ punch you in the f&#8211;kin’ face. But you know what? I’m a lady, so I won’t.” While the comments sparked a wave of viral discussion online, Manson later doubled down on her stance in a statement posted to Threads, where she clarified her long-standing distaste for beach balls at shows and broader frustration with how some fans treat live music spaces. “I make NO APOLOGIES whatsoever for getting annoyed at beach balls at shows,” she wrote. “I joined a band because I HATED THE F&#8211;KING BEACH. I joined a band because I wanted to listen to Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Cure and be dark and beautiful.” She continued, “I love the musical community and I want to respect their artistry.

I am AFAB transmasculine non-binary. Earlier this year, I had top surgery. I was born and perceived as female, but that label never represented who I truly am.” Cocona continued, “The hardest thing I’ve ever faced was accepting and embracing myself… Now, I can finally say, ‘There’s nothing wrong with who I am inside.’” The performer also expressed gratitude toward their XG bandmates, XGALX founder and producer Simon (Jakops) , and their parents, adding that their support helped make the journey possible. The message quickly drew an outpouring of love and praise from fans, with XG supporters and members of the LGBTQIA+ community celebrating Cocona’s honesty.
