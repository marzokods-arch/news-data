Speaking during her Not Alone Summit at Wynn Las Vegas in November, the singer, who has reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200 with six albums, reflected on the experience in an exclusive interview with PEOPLE , which first reported the story exclusively. According to Jewel, the incident took place in the summer of 1994, when she was 20 years old and traveling through Mexico with longtime collaborator Steve Poltz during a break from writing music. What began as a quiet songwriting retreat quickly escalated into something far more perilous. While spending time on a remote beach in Baja California, Jewel and Poltz were approached by armed men in uniform identifying themselves as Mexican federal police. After casually asking if the officers knew where they could go whale watching, the pair were invited onto a small boat — only to learn mid-trip that the officers were in the middle of an active drug bust. “They said, ‘We’re on a drug bust,’” Jewel recalled.

I come back to this hotel, and when I come back, three guys stand up like synchronized swimming.” According to Joe, the men approached him with a cryptic message: “The guys, they wanna shoot rockets with you.” When he asked who “the guys” were, the response instantly sent up red flags. “‘The Taliban, they love you,’” Joe recalled being told. “My a**hole got this tight, okay,” he joked, before clarifying that the situation didn’t feel like a joke at all. “I met the Taliban, it’s no f***ing bullshit.
