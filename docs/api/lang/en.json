According to Fat Mike, the documentary does not shy away from the most extreme, uncomfortable or self-destructive chapters of the group’s history. “Most people wouldn’t be OK with releasing a film that shows footage of getting whipped in their dungeon, or their drug use for the past 20 years, or dressing up like a rubber cheap whore, or the ambulance ride when they were naked while puking and shitting blood… I’m not like most people,” Fat Mike said. Directed by James Buddy Day, 40 Years of F**kin’ Up traces NOFX’s evolution from teenage punks to one of the most influential and polarising bands in modern punk history. The documentary features extensive interviews with the band’s core lineup — guitarist Eric Melvin, lead guitarist El Hefe and drummer Erik Sandin — all of whom also serve as executive producer…",
