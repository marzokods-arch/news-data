It’s believed that the new device will cost ~$2,446 in its home market instead of ~$2,718. That’s still significantly more expensive than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, though. Samsung is expected to launch a dual-folding foldable, informally dubbed the Galaxy tri-fold , before the end of the year.

Nano Banana Pro allowances for free users have been reduced from three to two images per day. Even NotebookLM features have been temporarily scaled back. Google launched Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro last week and, as expected, the response to the substantially upgraded AI tools has been overwhelmingly positive .

The phone has been approved by the FCC, which opens its gates to availability in the US. OnePlus hasn’t shared an update yet, but the FCC portal shows a certification for the phone. Despite the OnePlus 15’s global launch earlier this month, folks in the US have been deprived of the opportunity to buy one . The reason for its unavailability, as confirmed by OnePlus at the time of the launch, has been the recent US government shutdown, which ended only on November 12. Now that the ball is rolling again, the OnePlus 15 may finally have a chance at being sold in the US, and recent developments indicate it might happen soon. At the time of the launch, OnePlus had attributed the OnePlus 15’s unavailability in the US to a lack of approval from the FCC (Federal Communications Commission). Thankfully, the certificate, which had been stuck in limbo due to the government shutdown, has finally been released.",

    "body": "TL;DR How your smartwatch measures distance may vary depending on what kind of exercise you’re tracking. Walks, in particular, can rely on step data rather than GPS, resulting in potentially inaccurate figures. Wearables like smartwatches are utterly packed with sensors, and in using them we gather all sorts of data. But just how accurate are all of those numbers? With some, like calories burned during an exercise, it makes sense that the figure’s just an estimate, and we shouldn’t expect it to be precise. Other numbers, like how many steps you’ve taken, we’d assume were exact figures. Which of those camps would you think distance measurements fall into?

This mode offers the high throughput of 6GHz Wi-Fi while keeping the broad device compatibility of the 2.4GHz band. We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots. Pixel users can now create a 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspot by going to Se…",

OnePlus plans to share more details about the OnePlus 15R in mid-December. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is Qualcomm’s highest-end mobile SoC, driving recent Android flagships like the OnePlus 15 . But all that power comes with increased costs — and worse thermal performance . Now, though, OnePlus has confirmed that another of its upcoming devices will debut a new Qualcomm chipset that better balances performance and trade-offs. OnePlus has shared that its OnePlus 15R, its “ultimate value flagship device,” will be the first phone released worldwide to feature the (non-Elite) Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. OnePlus says it worked with Qualcomm to design the 8 Gen 5 in a collaborative project that started in 2023.",

By this point, it’s got to be pretty frustrating being a Samsung Galaxy user who keeps hearing about all the great stuff being implemented in One UI 8.5 — and yet you still don’t have the chance to try any of it out. We’ve been tracking information gleaned from One UI 8.5 leaks going back months now, but the manufacturer has yet to get the ball rolling on a public beta. We just learned that a Galaxy S25 build of One UI 8.5 had surfaced on a test server, making it look like Samsung might get started soon, and now some new rumors attempt to nail down exactly when.

If you’ve been eyeing an upgrade before the holiday chaos hits, the savings are hard to ignore. The standout is the Dreame X50 Ultra, a high-end robot vacuum built for homes where most bots still get tripped up. Its chassis can lift itself to climb over thresholds and door sills, and the corner-reaching system helps it clean further into tight spots than you normally get from a round robot. It also handles hair better thanks to its detangling brush setup, and the base station washes and dries the mop pads with high heat, so you’re not left dealing with damp fibers. With the price falling from $1,599.99 to just $799.99 for Black Friday, it’s one of the biggest drops in Dreame’s lineup.",

Besides playing audio over Bluetooth, these speakers also support Spotify Tap for easy access to your playlists. In addition to its ease of assembly and affordability, what helps IKEA furniture stand apart from the crowd (of other mass-produced furniture) is its inviting vibe and minimal aesthetic. Gladly, its wares extend beyond what has a few feet and sits on the ground. And one category that IKEA has absolutely crushed is obfuscated, visually stunning wireless speakers. IKEA previously offered Wi-Fi-based speakers in partnership with Sonos under its Symfonisk lineup. Since that has come to an end, IKEA has been exploring its own creations. It has now added two new speaker ranges to its inventory in partnership with Swedish designer Tekla Evelina Severin, who’s popularly known as “Teklan.”",

It will also incorporate RetroAchievements, external media, and even a theme shop. The app is still under development, but a public build may be ready as early as next Spring. When it comes to emulation, the experience often feels less like a console and more like a tedious series of menus and poorly labeled files. Emulation frontends like ES-DE and Beacon try to fix this, but none are as ambitious as iiSU. First revealed two months ago, a slick new video highlighting planned features was released yesterday. Helmed by experienced motion graphics designer Eddie Collazo (AKA iShade or UsagiShade), iiSU features a level of polish that’s rarely seen outside of first-party hardware from Nintendo and Sony.",

In another unusual branding decision from Qualcomm, this isn’t an S-series model, unlike the last-gen Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 . More curious is the company’s choice to make direct performance comparisons to its far older 8 Gen 3 (36% better performance and 42% better efficiency), which was released in late 2023, rather than the original 8 Elite. So, without the Elite moniker, is this still a proper high-end option or a mid-range chip in disguise? Let’s dig into how it stacks up against the latest Snapdragon 8-series processors.",

Projections from the market research firm indicate that iPhone shipments are expected to grow by approximately 10% in 2025, while Samsung’s Galaxy line shipments are estimated to increase by only 4.6%.

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR ChatGPT’s Voice Mode is now available directly within chats. It was previously open in a separate voice chat interface. With the update, Voice Mode will now display a live transcript as you converse with it and show more information, such as weather and maps, within the same chat. ChaGPT’s mobile app and web version are getting a handy update that integrates its Voice Mode directly inside the chat. That means you no longer have to access the separate screen with the blue orb; you can just access Voice Mode within a chat.",
