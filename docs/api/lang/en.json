Among those pledges was a focus on how well the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has been doing in terms of sales and public reception, and a vague promise to keep innovating within the foldable lineup and “provide new experiences.” I’m sure Samsung is subtly hinting at its upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold with its impressive tablet-and-phone design, but I do hope the allure of a hot new form factor doesn’t let the Korean giant forget about its existing Fold line-up. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 has already impressed us, but it still needs two major upgrades next year, and I don’t think Samsung should rest on its laurels or skip them.",

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

Instead of only solving the daily word, you can make them yourself.

The new Card 5 is even thinner than previous models and supports wireless charging. Google’s Find Hub got off to a rough start, but as time’s gone on, the network has become more useful and we’ve seen a wider variety of tracker hardware. Today, one of the earliest manufacturers of Find Hub trackers, Pebblebee, is selling a couple of new trackers that come with some interesting perks. Pebblebee has started sales of new versions of its Clip and Card trackers. They’re both compatible with Google’s Find Hub as well as Apple Find My, and unlike many previous Pebblebee trackers, neither requires a proprietary charger. They’re also marked with QR codes that let anyone who finds them contact you to return your lost item.",

Once Samsung or Google or Apple proves an idea is technically viable and, more importantly, marketable, the other players often move to implement it in their own products. Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display. We first heard that the foldable iPhone would feature an under-display camera by way of a May leak . Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones used similar technology through the Z Fold 6 until switching to a more conventional hole-punch design in the Z Fold 7.

However, there’s one aspect that keeps me from feeling completely satisfied, which is the limitation of using wallpapers of my choice.

Super early bird pricing will remain for two weeks, with shipping expected to start in mid-December for the G3 Gen 3 model. The Snapdragon 8 Elite model will go up for pre-sale on the website in a few weeks, as it’s further from shipping. The Indiegogo campaign for the KONKR Pocket FIT was a smash success, raising nearly $1 million before it ended yesterday. Typically, these devices become much more difficult to recommend after the early bird deals end, but in this case, you have a little more time. AYANEO has announced that pre-sales for the KONKR Pocket FIT will continue via its official website . More importantly, the super early bird pricing, which was previously extended until the end of the Indiegogo campaign, has been extended for an additional two weeks.",

Among other features, we could see the option to click pictures at 24MP by default instead of the existing 12MP or 50MP modes. Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series appears to have kept Samsung busier than usual. While the lineup was slated to receive an overhaul with new product names, the changes were reportedly quashed recently, forcing Samsung to return to the older classification . And all this toiling may have contributed to a delayed launch and fewer upgrades to the Galaxy S26 series than we had hoped , especially in the camera department. While the camera itself isn’t receiving any significant upgrades, some of the software features supporting it are expected to improve. One way we can see this improvement is by adding additional camera settings options to Samsung phones through a first-party extension.",

If approved by the judge overseeing the case, the settlement would resolve the lawsuit Epic filed in 2020 to challenge Google’s stranglehold on Android app distribution. As part of the agreement, Google plans to make sweeping changes to Android, which will be implemented in a future version of next year’s Android 17 release. The company is developing a new system that will allow users to easily install third-party app stores, reducing the friction of getting apps from outside of Google Play. This timing is notable, as next year is also when Android’s new developer verification requirements will go into effect. Beginning in September 2026, Android will block users from installing apps made by unverified developers. Although Google says that sideloading isn’t going anywhere, some critics are concerned this change will kill alternative app stores like F-Droid . That’s why Google’s agreement with Epic has sparked hope that Android’s sideloading restrictions will be eased or eliminated entirely next year.",

    "body": "TL;DR A flag in Android’s Carrier Config Manager allows cellular carriers to artificially inflate the number of bars shown on your phone. Google explains that the majority of carriers require this option, and its addition to the Android codebase dates back to 2017. Android artificially inflates network signal strength to appear as a five-bar scale, rather than the original four-bar scale. Network carriers aren’t afraid to use clever names and marketing to make their cellular performance appear better than it actually is. A prime example is AT&amp;T’s use of the 5GE badge , which is 4G LTE rather than 5G . The truth is, many carriers use similar strategies to market their cellular networks. A flag in the Android codebase that’s recently been getting a lot of attention has led some to believe Google was colluding to artificially inflate signal strength, but the true purpose of the flag appears to be much simpler. A report by Nick vs Networking from last month highlighted a flag named KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL in Android’s Carrier Config Manager. The Carrier Config Manager explains this flag as determining if the Android system “should interpret all signal strength as one bar …",

If you’ve been wondering why Google’s viral image editor ended up with the nickname “Nano Banana,” the mystery’s over. The team says the moniker started life as a throwaway placeholder, and then the internet refused to let it go. On the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast , product lead David Sharon explains that the model’s official name is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. However, when a Product Manager named Nina submitted the model anonymously to the LM Arena benchmark website, allowing users to test it out, she had to enter a temporary label that kept it anonymous. At 2:30 in the morning, “Nano Banana” popped into her head. The next thing they knew, the model had gone viral, and people kept using the playful name, so Google ultimately embraced it in public.",

First teased earlier this year, the company finally revealed the Pocket VERT earlier today in the YouTube video shown above. As promised, it’s a glamorous take on the Game Boy, with a CNC-machined body and “diamond-cut” shoulder buttons. It also appears to have an all-glass front, as well as transluscent, unlabeled buttons.",

I wasn’t sure if they would be at first — I remember plenty of the problems with Samsung’s original Galaxy Z Fold — but they’ve come a long way in just seven years. Their hinges have gotten stronger, cameras better, and software more mature, yet they’re still as eye-catching and head-turning as ever. I should know — I’ve had my hands on almost every foldable (and flip) phone to launch in the US or abroad since the start. Have I loved them all? Of course not, but I , along with the rest of the Android Authority team, have watched them steadily improve to the point where we’ll happily carry the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold or Motorola Razr Ultra as a daily driver over a traditional Android phone .",

But there are some days when I’m still jealous, furious, and furiously jealous of Apple’s influence on the entire mobile ecosystem. See, not only did a few Android brands decide to adopt Liquid Glass-like influences in their own Android skins (I’m looking at you, vivo and Xiaomi), but more and more app developers are already adopting the design language in their iOS apps, too. Good for them, but hey, ho, hey, I’m here, waving my Material 3 Expressive Pixel. Can I also get some acknowledgment, please?",
