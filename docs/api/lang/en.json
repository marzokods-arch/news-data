    "body": "A new lawsuit alleges Downtown Music Holdings threw a licensing partner under the bus as a “sacrifice” to lessen regulatory scrutiny of its controversial acquisition by Universal Music Group (UMG). The $375 million complaint, filed on Monday (Nov. 10) in Manhattan federal court, centers on Downtown’s relationship with YouTube music provider Blast Off Media. According to the lawsuit, Downtown unlawfully ended its distribution contract with Blast Off — and destroyed an entire music catalog in the process — over concerns regarding the European Commission’s review of Downtown&#8217;s proposed $775 million merger with UMG’s Virgin Music Group.

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

YouTube TV and Disney are now solidly into week two of failing to work out a new coverage deal, with the consequence that the latter’s channel properties have gone dark on the former’s streaming service. The fallout’s been spreading to other streaming solutions, too, and although subscribers have been offered a $20 credit , what they really want are their channels back. As we wait to see if some compromise can be made, we’re getting a little new insight into what could be the core sticking point that’s in the way of an easy solution.

As opposed to other pass types — store loyalty cards or concert tickets, for example — private passes come with extra security features meant to help keep critical information attached to documents like government IDs or health insurance cards private. One of those security features is that private passes can only exist on a single device at one time, but it looks like that could be changing. Experimenting with the latest version of Google Play services, we spotted code that indicates Google Wallet might soon incorporate features that will allow users to transfer private passes between devices, or even sync them between multiple concurrent devices.",

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm is rumored to have added Android 16 support for its Snapdragon X PC chips. While it sparks hopes about Android-based PCs, there’s not enough evidence or clarity yet. One of the biggest roadblocks is the absence of proper software support, as Android still lacks a fully functional desktop mode. Google’s Chrome OS has aged better than most PC users would have anticipated, but its long run is nearing its end. Google has already confirmed its plans to merge Chrome OS with Android , and the driver behind this shift is the need to manage engineering resources more effectively and compete with Apple . While this is expected to be a multi-year transition, we may see actual laptops — not flagship tablets capable of serving as laptop replacements — running Android soon. Tech analyst known as @Jukanlosreve on X recently shared a rumor about Qualcomm testing Android 16 for its Snapdragon X series chips. What makes the development interesting is that while the Snapdragon X, X Plus, and X Elite chipsets feature an Arm64 architecture, similar to those found in phone chips, Qualcomm specifically designates them for thin and light laptops. In simpler terms, Android 16 may be being t…",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR A developer is building a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10, called Marathon OS. This is a Linux-based mobile platform that features BlackBerry 10-inspired features like Active Frames and a Hub inbox. Marathon OS currently runs on the OnePlus 6, with plans to bring it to the OnePlus 6T, POCO F1, and more. BlackBerry 10 may have been a failed rival to Android and iOS, but it was an intriguing and innovative mobile platform in its own right. Now, an enterprising developer has decided to build a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10, and it’ll run on Android phones . Developer Patrick Quinn has announced development of the Marathon OS project , which he claims will be a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10. Quinn says the platform will include BB10 staples such as the familiar gesture navigation system, a take on the BlackBerry Hub for a unified messaging/notification inbox, and the Active Frames concept. When it comes to the latter, BlackBerry 10 had a home screen that showed currently running apps as card-based windows, and these windows were still able to refresh in real-time. Marathon OS even features the BB10 peek gesture, which …",

Usually, I know how things are going to go: Apple will put up a pretty good fight with solid cameras and excellent optimization, only to come up short in terms of the overall experience. This year, however, I feel like there has been less change from one generation of Android flagship to the next from the two most prominent players in the US. The Galaxy S25 line barely needed to exist, and the Pixel 10 series is the best phone Google has ever made, but it’s not life-changing — it’s still a Pixel, just better. This has opened the door for the iPhone 17 Pro to make an impression on me. So, I swapped to iOS for a month, and here’s how it went.",

To make things easier for people who create a large number of images, Google has recently introduced a “My Stuff” section in the Gemini on Android. It stores all your generated images in one place. And now, Google appears to be adding another option that changes how you share them. Google is changing how you share images generated with Gemini or Nano Banana.

Some earbuds will connect instantly and stay that way; others need companion apps, extra permissions, or software workarounds to unlock full functionality. Basically, it’s a toss-up. It’s why the Pixel Buds have usually been my reliable choice, mostly for being the exception to this. They’re made by Google, tuned to perform consistently well with Android, and generally behave as expected. But being the default doesn’t necessarily make them the best. The Pixel Buds are great, but being the default doesn't make them the best. On the opposite end of the spectrum, odd as it might seem, it’s not rare to find Android users choosing AirPods as their Bluetooth earbuds of choice. Honestly, it’s easy to see why. They’re familiar and sound good enough. The AirPods have built a reputation for consistency and carry a level of brand cachet that alternatives often don’t. They’re a known commodity, a safe option, and that counts for a lot in a market full of competitors that promise the moon. But that doesn’t mean…",

It is available now, priced at $279.99, from Viwoods and third-party retailers like Amazon. Viwoods’ newest AiPaper Reader just became the first E Ink device to ship with Android 16 . While Viwoods isn’t the first brand to blend E Ink with Android, it’s the first to do so on Google’s latest software, a distinction that hints at faster updates and a push to make e-readers feel less isolated from the rest of the Android ecosystem. Specs-wise, the pocket-sized e-reader is built around a 6.13-inch Carta 1300 display at 300ppi, offering faster refresh rates and higher contrast than older panels. With a design that measures 6.7mm thick and just 138g, it looks more like a small phone than a tablet, making it an easy everyday carry for readers who want something portable.",

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says Apple has no plans to publicly acknowledge that Gemini will partly power Siri. Internally, the Gemini-based model is referred to as AFM v10, short for “Apple Foundation Model version 10,” a name chosen to obscure the partnership and avoid confusing staff and customers.

Fitbit Charge 6: The best sleep tracker overall I’ve tested dozens of sleep trackers, and Fitbit continues to offer some of the most reliable and actionable sleep data I’ve gotten my hands on. The Fitbit Charge 6 is my top pick for tapping into that ecosystem. The band-style tracker is compact, lightweight, and comfortable enough to wear all night, which is essential for bedtime tracking. Yet, despite its small form factor, it also packs in a well-rounded user experience for all-day wear. Alongside standout sleep features, the Charge 6 supports over 20 exercise modes, offers stress tracking via EDA scans, and integrates smoothly with Google’s growing suite of apps, all on a bright, colorful AMOLED display.",

    "body": "TL;DR YouTuber JerryRigEverything peeled open the new REDMAGIC 11 Pro to reveal its wild liquid cooling system. You can actually see the phone’s blue coolant circulating through the whole system. The RedMagic 11 Pro uses an unfreezable, server-grade fluorinated liquid and a piezoelectric micropump to move coolant through a loop. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro , Nubia’s brand-new gaming phone, is already one of the most eye-catching Android flagships right now. However, it turns out that the phone’s hidden liquid cooling system might just be its most jaw-dropping feature. In a new YouTube Short, JerryRigEverything’s Zack Nelson peeled back the rear cover of the phone to show what’s concealed underneath, and it’s unlike anything we’ve seen before.",

It gets a lot right, but one missing feature is preventing it from becoming my main browser. There’s a lot to like Credit: Zac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority The feature I love most in Samsung Internet is the split-view mode, along with the sidebar. Split-view puts two tabs side-by-side without having to open a new instance of the tab. The sidebar, as seen in the far right of the image, is a space where you can open a third page in a mobile UI. This has been great for researching and writing articles, as I can have my writing and two research tabs open all in one place without switching windows.",
