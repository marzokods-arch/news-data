The Pocket G2 ships this week, while the more powerful Pocket 6 won’t ship until January Retroid just announced its new lineup of handhelds yesterday, and we didn’t have to wait long to buy them. Whereas companies like AYANEO and AYN tease handhelds for weeks or even months before they go to market, the Retroid Pocket G2 and Pocket 6 are already up for sale on the official website. That said, only one is truly close to shipping, and that’s the Pocket G2. As the name implies, it’s the first Android gaming handheld with Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 processor, which should be significantly more powerful than the Snapdragon 865 on the Pocket 5. We were very impressed with the performance on the cheaper G1 Gen 2 SoC found on the Retroid Pocket Classic , but stay tuned for full G2 Gen 2 testing in the coming weeks.",

Likewise, accessibility tweaks improved navigation for visually impaired users. A recent Kindle Scribe update delivered new pen tools and a sleeker sidebar for note-taking.",

Users had to downgrade to an older release of the camera app to use it again. To fix the issue, users on GrapheneOS build v2025102300 and older can install the GmsCompatLib app v100 from the GrapheneOS store. A future GrapheneOS build (v2025102600) will include the Pixel Camera app fix natively, eliminating the need for extra installation. Last week, the Pixel Camera app began crashing on de-Googled aftermarket OS solutions, such as GrapheneOS. If users didn’t have Google Play Services on their device, the Pixel Camera app would either crash or refuse to start. As it turns out, the actual issue was a missing font . Users could roll back to older versions of the Pixel Camera app, but now, the fix is here for GrapheneOS users. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This would be a dramatic and overdue increase in battery capacity for the Z Fold family. The phone is also tipped to offer S Pen support and a reduced display crease. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best foldable phones of 2025, and that’s largely due to its cutting-edge design. However, the Z Fold 7 retains a 4,400mAh battery for the fifth straight generation, while Samsung also nixed S Pen support. There might be good news for the Galaxy Z Fold 8, though. Dealsite (via Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that the Galaxy Z Fold 8 could have a battery larger than 5,000mAh. This would be much bigger than the Z Fold 7’s 4,400mAh battery.",

Both oozed control, not a lack of it. Edwards, the 30-year-old native of Fresno, California, with his burly, oak-flavored tones, and Melton, the 29-year-old from Fayetteville, Georgia, whose soulful voice has a hint of sweetness, could barely be separated. Mind, this is no ordinary song. &#8220;Lose Control&#8221; in July became the first number in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 to spend triple-digit weeks on the chart, as it cleared its milestone 100th frame . Niall Horan “loved” Melton’s voice, remarking that it’s “really pure, really clean.” And Edwards, the Irishman remarked, his energy, his power and rasp, “it’s aggressive but it’s controlled.” Reba McEntire read from her notes a performance she described as “powerful, smooth like butter. Raspy, smooth like velvet.” The country ace admitted the decision to split them would be a tough one. If she had to, she’d pick Melton. Both cont…",

But Tame Impala and its creative mastermind, Kevin Parker , have remained busy. After the arena run in support of Tame&#8217;s fourth album, February 2020&#8217;s The Slow Rush , was put on ice a couple shows in due to the pandemic, Parker and company returned to the road in late 2021, kicking off two years of heavy touring.

And, with Deadbeat , which continues the evolution of Tame&#8217;s original psych-rock sound toward more dance-oriented music, Parker notched another milestone: The set&#8217;s single &#8220;Dracula&#8221; became his first entry as lead artist on the Hot 100, and currently sits at No. 59 on the tally.

Seven and the Ragged Tiger was released in 1983, and yielded the global hits “New Moon on Monday,” “Union of the Snake” and “The Reflex,” which gave Duran Duran the first of two No. 1s on the Billboard Hot 100 and Official U.K. Singles Chart.&nbsp; Seven And The Ragged Tiger is the only Duran Duran collection to lead the Official U.K. Albums Chart, and it proved to be the band&#8217;s final effort with its classic &#8220;Fab Five&#8221; lineup of Taylor/Taylor/Taylor/Rhodes/Le Bon, until Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor (the Taylors are unrelated) returned to the fold two decades later, for 2004&#8217;s Astronaut .

The company says both platforms will remain available for the foreseeable future. It looks like the transition away from Android Auto and CarPlay may not happen until GM is ready to roll out its centralized vehicle computing platform. As we learned last week, General Motors isn’t just planning to ditch Android Auto and Apple CarPlay in its EVs. The largest automobile manufacturer in the US plans to get rid of the two platforms in its gas-powered vehicles as well. Now the company has released a new statement that reveals there’s still plenty of time before that change happens. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s Galaxy XR headset has a hidden USB-C port under a cap on the right strap. The USB-C port works independently of the proprietary battery connector, so Galaxy XR can charge and use wired accessories simultaneously. Compared to Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest headsets, Galaxy XR figures to handle wired accessories better thanks to the dedicated port. Samsung is helping to usher in the Android XR platform with its first headset, known as Galaxy XR. It appears to take design cues from competitors like Apple and Meta, but has clear advantages of its own. Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector. The headset’s tethered battery connects with a proprietary pin system, opening up the USB-C port for use with other accessories.",

The updated context menu will centralize buttons for sharing and selecting chats, making them easier to reach. It should also clarify which chats are selected or unselected in a group, which was previously confusing with Material You shading. Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

Last month, some Samsung Family Hub smart refrigerator owners began pointing out something peculiar about the update they received. The changelog for the update mentioned that the cover screen would begin displaying advertisements, among other information. A new update is now rolling out that will bring this to all Family Hub fridges with screens above a certain size.

The preview is available for Fitbit Premium users with a Pixel Watch or Fitbit device (Android first). The tool offers AI-driven guidance on fitness, sleep, and health through a chat interface. Google is officially putting health-focused AI to work on users’ wrists. Beginning October 28, the company will open a public preview of its Gemini-powered Fitbit Personal Health Coach for Fitbit Premium users in the US. The feature was first announced in August, when Google launched the Pixel Watch 4 . It uses Gemini’s conversational smarts to blend fitness training, sleep analysis, and general health advice into a single chat-based experience. Rather than simply a new feature, the rollout represents a test drive of Google’s broader vision of personalized wellness, coinciding with a complete Fitbit app overhaul. The app’s redesigned interface divides everything into four tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep, and Health , and shifts the focus from daily streaks to long-term progress. Users can zoom out to view weekly trends, customize “Focus Metrics,” and move seamlessly between activity, recovery, an…",

While we’ve generally been fans of the changes, not every swing in this Expressive direction is going to be a hit. And even though we saw Google take a very slow, measured approach to deploying these updates, some of those less-than-successful tweaks have managed to slip through to public releases. The good news is that Google is learning from your feedback, and already appears to be correcting just such an oversight.

One summary said “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” while another labeled a man living alone as “Sarah.” If the reports are accurate, a likely possibility is that Gemini on Google Home is hallucinating, rather than intruders or data mix-ups. With Halloween week upon us, it probably isn’t the best time for your smart home to start suggesting that people you aren’t familiar with have been wandering your property. However, a couple of Reddit users claim their Google Home devices have started describing people they don’t know. According to a post on the r/googlehome subreddit , a user’s Nest camera described an activity summary saying “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” even though no one by that name lives there. When the user asked about it, Google’s assistant reportedly replied that its camera “can identify faces even if you haven’t explicitly named them,” and that it had spotted “Michael” between October 26 and 27. The user said they’d never entered that name into the system, but the actions described were what he himself had done. He found the response …",

More details will be revealed in a livestream tomorrow morning, but it won’t be cheap. While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",

Thankfully, the wait for a full reveal is over, as OnePlus has just launched the device in China today. We’ve already seen the phone’s design, featuring flat edges with curved corners and a redesigned rear camera bump. OnePlus says the phone also has IP69 and IP69K ratings, which are overkill but still welcome after years of IP rating disappointment. Take a closer look at the left edge of the phone, and you’ll see a remappable shortcut button in lieu of the trademark alert slider. That’s a significant move after years of OnePlus flagships using the slider key (with the exception of the OnePlus 10T). Nevertheless, this shortcut key can be used for ringing profiles, AI functionality, taking screenshots, and more.",

Today, we’re learning about the stable One UI 8 for the Galaxy A54 — which was among of the best selling 5G Android phone of 2023 . While the mid-ranger from 2023 already started receiving the One UI 8 update a few weeks ago in regions such as Korea and India, it’s now also available for folks in the US.",

The surprise handheld here is the Pocket G2, which is the first gaming handheld to ship with Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 chipset. Designed specifically for gaming handhelds, it should have more power and better sustained performance than Retroid’s previous flagship.

The app differs from NetherSX2 due to its open-source nature and its use of a more recent foundation. NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution. Fortunately, the ARMSX2 emulator has been in testing for a while, and it’s finally received a version 1.0 release. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

    "body": "TL;DR Over the past day or so, several reports of Pixel phones struggling to connect to 911 emergency services have appeared on Reddit. Affected models reportedly include the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 8. We’ve reached out to Google for comment. The smartphone has become our modern Swiss Army knife, bundling practically unlimited disparate functions into a single pocketable device. Still, arguably the most important feature in any smartphone is that it’s, well, a phone, letting us make calls from anywhere. In emergency situations, the phone part of the smartphone is all the more important — but Google’s phones are reportedly having a hard time there. Android Police has rounded up some recent reports from Reddit that say the Pixel 10 , Pixel 9, and Pixel 8 have all had issues contacting emergency services in the US, with calls failing to go through. These reports are anecdotal, but any failed call to 911 could potentially have disastrous consequences.",

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",

Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet.
