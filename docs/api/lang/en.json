    "body": "TL;DR How your smartwatch measures distance may vary depending on what kind of exercise you’re tracking. Walks, in particular, can rely on step data rather than GPS, resulting in potentially inaccurate figures. Wearables like smartwatches are utterly packed with sensors, and in using them we gather all sorts of data. But just how accurate are all of those numbers? With some, like calories burned during an exercise, it makes sense that the figure’s just an estimate, and we shouldn’t expect it to be precise. Other numbers, like how many steps you’ve taken, we’d assume were exact figures. Which of those camps would you think distance measurements fall into?

Google’s Nano Banana Pro model , based on the Gemini 3 Pro Image, is one of the best tools available today for generating images. My colleague Mishaal Rahman tried out Nano Banana Pro and walked away impressed . The image model is great for creating and editing images, but you’ll still need to use another app to add annotations manually.

This mode offers the high throughput of 6GHz Wi-Fi while keeping the broad device compatibility of the 2.4GHz band. We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots.

A new “don’t ask me again” checkbox allows the system to remember your preference for specific monitors. This streamlines the setup process, removing the need to dig through Settings to switch between mirroring and desktop modes. With the first quarterly release of Android 16 , certain Pixel phones gained more flexibility when connected to an external display. Rather than being restricted to simple screen mirroring, they can now project a desktop-like interface via Android’s new Desktop Mode . While Desktop Mode is great for productivity, you need a mouse and keyboard to really take advantage of it. Without these peripherals, controlling apps becomes difficult unless your external display has a touchscreen. In these cases, screen mirroring remains the better option, as it allows you to navigate using your phone while viewing content on the big screen.",

Earlier this year, we saw signs that two of those methods were growing closer together — and now, that project is finally rolling out broadly. Back in May , we got our first glimpse at how Circle to Search-like functionality would play out in Gemini. In that in-progress version of the feature, you could share a screenshot with Gemini, then circle portions of the screenshot to zero in on what you wanted to search for. The implementation rolling out now saves a step: after calling up Gemini, you just draw a circle around the part of your screen you want to share.",

IKEA previously offered Wi-Fi-based speakers in partnership with Sonos under its Symfonisk lineup. Since that has come to an end, IKEA has been exploring its own creations.

It will feature a 4.7-inch 120Hz display and a Dimensity 8300 SoC in a vertical form factor. It could be officially announced as early as this week. ANBERNIC got a late start this year, but it’s been absolutely churning out new Android gaming handhelds over the past few months. The PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , the all-metal RG 477M , and the upcoming dual-screened RG DS are highlights, but leaks indicate that there’s a new device on the horizon. Renders and photos of an engineering sample of the RG 477V have leaked on the Retro Handhelds Discord . If they turn out to be correct (which is almost always the case), the vertical handheld will have the same 4.7-inch 120Hz screen and Dimensity 8300 SoC as the RG 477M.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority Qualcomm unveiled its powerhouse Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 back in September and has now quickly followed up with Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 — a more affordable take on its flagship package that should still sit near the top of the chipset pecking order. In another unusual branding decision from Qualcomm, this isn’t an S-series model, unlike the last-gen Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 . More curious is the company’s choice to make direct performance comparisons to its far older 8 Gen 3 (36% better performance and 42% better efficiency), which was released in late 2023, rather than the original 8 Elite. So, without the Elite moniker, is this still a proper high-end option or a mid-range chip in disguise? Let’s dig into how it stacks up against the latest Snapdragon 8-series processors.",

Analysts say that pandemic-era upgrades, a weaker dollar, easing U.S.–China tensions, and improving demand in price-sensitive regions all boost Apple’s momentum. Samsung has led global smartphone sales for over a decade, but its dominance is now at risk. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple is on track to overtake Samsung this year and remain the world’s top smartphone maker through 2029. Projections from the market research firm indicate that iPhone shipments are expected to grow by approximately 10% in 2025, while Samsung’s Galaxy line shipments are estimated to increase by only 4.6%. That’s a major gap for two companies often assumed neck-and-neck. On a global level, Apple is projected to grab around 19.4% of total smartphone shipments this year — a threshold not seen since 2011 (via Bloomberg ).",

Expect the handsets to offer 100W wired charging speeds, an IP68 rating, an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor, the same display brightness figures, and the Hyper OS 3 skin. Both phones also get four major Android OS upgrades and six years of security patches. However, it’s clear that the Ultra handset is the standout offering here, and not just because of the traditional spec sheet.",

The persistent Google search bar, part of the Pixel launcher, may be getting radiant colors that better match your wallpaper, as 9to5Google notes.

WhatsApp has been working on adding more creative tools to the status feature, which is great. However, creating a status often becomes a time-consuming process, and it’s pretty common to get interrupted when you’re halfway through. Unfortunately, if you exit the status-creation screen, you will lose your progress and have to start over.

    "body": "TL;DR This early Black Friday drop brings the XGIMI Halo+ GTV down to around $509, a significant discount from ~$800. The upgraded portable projector now offers built-in Google TV. It also delivers 1080p resolution, 700 ISO lumens, Harman Kardon speakers, and a 2.5-hour built-in battery. My standards for portable devices are getting unreasonable, but the Halo+ GTV clears the bar anyway. XGIMI’s latest refresh folds Google TV and licensed Netflix support directly into this compact projector, meaning you don’t need a streaming stick to get your shows going. Now, thanks to an early Black Friday price drop, the compact all-in-one package is down to around $509, well below its usual $799. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The app may also change how it communicates location sharing, and possibly offer live updates. Gemini could get a little more prominent, thanks to a larger floating button. Google’s constantly updating its Android apps, but not every change is going to have a monumental impact. Far more often, developers are just trying something new to see what they can improve, tweaking app UIs with new menu listings, button placements, and screen layouts. Even those seemingly small changes are of interest to Android enthusiasts like us, and today we’ve collected a few of them that are in the works for Google Messages .
