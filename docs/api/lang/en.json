    "summary": "For the eighth year in a row, the world’s oceans absorbed a record-breaking amount of heat in 2025.",
    "body": "Since 2018, a group of researchers from around the world has crunched the numbers on how much heat the world’s oceans are absorbing each year. In 2025, their measurements broke records once again, making this the eighth year in a row that the world’s oceans have absorbed more heat than in the years before. The study, which was published Friday in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Science, found that the world’s oceans absorbed an additional 23 zettajoules’ worth of heat in 2025, the most in any year since modern measurements began in the 1960s. That’s significantly higher than the 16 additional zettajoules they absorbed in 2024. The research comes from a team of more than 50 scientists across the United States, Europe, and China. A joule is a common way to measure energy. A single joule is a relatively small unit of measurement—it’s about enough to power a tiny lightbulb for a second, or slightly heat a gram of water. But a zettajoule is one sextillion joules; numerically, the 23 zettajoules the oceans absorbed this year can be written out as 23,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Read full article Comments",

Much of the discourse around reusable rockets in Europe has focused on developing a brand new rocket that might eventually replace the Ariane 6, which debuted less than two years ago but still uses the use it and lose it model embraced by the launch industry for most of the Space Age. The European Space Agency (ESA) is offering money to emerging rocket companies in Europe to prove their small satellite launchers can do the job. ESA is also making money available to incentivize rocket upgrades to haul heavier cargo into orbit. ESA, the European Commission, and national governments are funding rocket hoppers to demonstrate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies. While there is significant money behind these efforts, the projects are not unified, and progress has been slow. Read full article Comments",

An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called \"content chunking\" may fall into that category.

You've probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn't made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot. According to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn't use such signals to improve ranking. \"One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content i…",

Cloudflare said it will fight the penalty and threatened to remove all of its servers from Italian cities. AGCOM issued the fine under Italy's controversial Piracy Shield law, saying that Cloudflare was required to disable DNS resolution of domain names and routing of traffic to IP addresses reported by copyright holders. The law provides for fines up to 2 percent of a company's annual turnover, and the agency said it applied a fine equal to 1 percent. The fine relates to a blocking order issued to Cloudflare in February 2025. Cloudflare argued that installing a filter applying to the roughly 200 billion daily requests to its DNS system would significantly increase latency and negatively affect DNS resolution for sites that aren't subject to the dispute over piracy.

For example, there are recipes for poisoning projective weapons, and deploying them in battle, in Greek and Roman historical documents, as well as references in Greek mythology and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey . Chinese warriors over the ages did the same, as did the Gauls and Scythians, and some Native American populations. Archaeologists have now found traces of a plant-based poison on several 60,000-year-old quartz Stone Age arrowheads found in South Africa, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. That would make this the oldest direct evidence of using poisons on projectiles—a cognitively complex hunting strategy—and pushes the timeline for using poison arrows back into the Pleistocene. The poisons commonly used could be derived from plants or animals (frogs, beetles, venomous lizards). Plant-based examples include curare, a muscle relaxant that paralyzes the victim's respiratory system, causing death by asphyxiation. Oleander, milkweeds, or inee (onaye) contain cardiac glucosides.

    "body": "American automakers who got overenthusiastic about electric vehicles continue to pay the price—literally. Yesterday, General Motors told investors that building and selling fewer EVs will cost the company $6 billion. Still, things could be worse—last month, rival Ford said it would write down $19.5 billion as a result of its failed EV bet. GM is not actually abandoning its EV portfolio, even as it reduces shifts at some plants and repurposes others—like the one in Orion, Michigan—into assembling combustion-powered pickups and SUVs instead of EVs. The electric crossovers, SUVs, and pickups from Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC will remain on sale, with the rebatteried Chevy Bolt joining their ranks this year. But GM says it expects to sell many fewer EVs than once planned. For one thing, the US government abolished the clean vehicle tax credit, which cut the price of an American-made EV by up to $7,500. That government has also told automakers it no longer cares if they sell plenty of inefficient vehicles. Add to that the hostility from car dealers by having to sell EVs in the first place, and one can see why GM has decided to retreat, even if we might not sympathize. Read full article…",

Instead, the Crew-11 astronauts will depart the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming days and head for reentry and a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.

Fleming's tool would record everything done on the target device, and the videos would be uploaded to a server where they could be viewed by the pcTattletale subscriber. This might sound creepy, but it can also be legal when used by a parent monitoring their child or an employer monitoring their workers. These are exactly the use cases that were once outlined on pcTattletale's website, where the software was said to have \"helped tens of thousands of parents stop their daughters from meeting up with pedophiles.\" Businesses could \"track productivity, theft, lost hours, and more.\" Even \"police departments use it for investigating.\" But this week, nearly 25 years after launching pcTattletale, Fleming pled guilty in federal court to having knowingly built and marketed software to spy on other adults without their consent. In other words, pcTattletale was often used to spy on romantic partners without their knowledge—and Fleming helped people do it. Read full article Comments",

Overall, the new guidelines: lambaste added sugars and highly processed foods (though it doesn't clearly define them); ditch previous limits on alcohol while directing Americans to just drink \"less\"; beef up recommendations for protein, including red meat; and appear to embrace saturated fats while not actually changing the 2020–2025 recommendation for how much you should eat—which was and continues to be no more than 10 percent of total daily calories. \"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said triumphantly in a White House press briefing Wednesday, despite the lack of a change.

    "body": "When it comes to cognitive ability, not all dogs are created equal. Most dogs can learn simple action cues like “sit” or “down.\" But so-called “gifted word learner” (GWL) dogs exhibit a remarkable ability to learn the names of objects—for example, learning the names of specific toys so well that they can retrieve them from a large pile of toys on command. And according to a new study published in the journal Science, they can even learn labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. Per the authors, this suggests that GWL dogs have sociocognitive skills that are functionally comparable to those of 18-month-old human toddlers. Co-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the Genius Dog Challenge . For instance, the group’s 2022 study discovered that dogs store key sensory features about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also…",
