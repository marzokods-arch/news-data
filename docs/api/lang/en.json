    "body": "Memory has been in a weird spot as of late. The increased demands presented by the rise of AI , plus the expansion of data centres, stock shortages, and the winding down of DDR4 have all left the typical gamer caught out in the rain. Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board. This unwillingness to lock in prices is likely linked to the sudden demand/memory shortage, and Digitimes reports that Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are all likely …",

In a post on X discussing Avalanche Studios' cancelled game Contraband , Cristofer Sundberg stated that Swedish studio would be unlikely to make a fifth Just Cause game due to the fact that the majority of the series' key creatives have since departed the studio. Sundberg, who left Avalanche Studios in 2019, said that Just Cause 5 'would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.\" Now, it doesn't immediately follow that changes in personnel means a developer will stop iterating upon a particular series. None of Doom's original creators still work at id Software, for example, but the studio keeps making great spins on its world-changing FPS. Sundberg, however, believes that the will to make Just Cause games left with the series' key creators, a problem he says became evident during the creation of Just Cause 4 .

I'll be honest, I've never really understood the 'RPG to action game' pipeline that many popular series—and studios—have gone through. Consider Dragon Age; born as a CRPG, forced to live through little chips and nicks that turned it into a third-person action game with RPG elements. I mean, I get it on paper. Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element. But as we've gone on, I'm growing less and less convinced that this idea—that we simply cannot handle anything more difficult, or it'll hurt our walnut gamer brains—was ever true.

    "body": "The future of EA has looked, well, uncertain since it got picked up in the biggest leveraged buyout in private equity history. For one thing, it's now on the hook for $20 billion in debt. For another, the buyout came from a group of investors that included Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners—founded by Donald Trump's son in law Jared Kushner. LGBT people and women more generally face repression in Saudi Arabia , while Kushner, of course, has strong ties to a Trump administration which has made attacking LGBT rights a cornerstone of its platform. The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements. That'd be a terrible idea for a lot of obvious, moral reasons, but one OG Sims designer (via FRVR ) says it would be \"existential for the business.\" Charles London, who worked as art director on The Sims 1 and creative director on The Sims 2, said that representing same-sex relationships in the earlier games was \"everything\" for the series. \"I think it's existential for the business, right?

Counterintuitively, it has to do with how easy text adventures are to make (or at least, to iterate ideas in). \"The strength of the text-based genre is that its scope isn't limited by the need to make 3D models and textures and mechanics,\" Zeekerss explained.

Even better is that the olives are near a bunch of quests you can complete on the same run if you've got them, like With a Trace , A First Foothold , or Reduced to Rubble . So, here's where you should look to get olives in Arc Raiders. Where to find olives in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) It sounds obvious once you know, but the best place to find olives is the Olive Grove on the Blue Gate map , where you can find them on the ground around some of the trees around the outskirts of the orchard, and you can sometimes kick said trees to drop more. Chances are, this is also where you headed for the earlier Scrappy upgrade that required lemons and apricots , though the olive trees are slightly larger than the fruit trees. Blue Gate's Olive Grove attracts a ton of players, likely also hunting for olives, lemons, or apr…",

While it's not quite as involved as What We Left Behind or Eyes in the Sky , both of which require visiting three separate regions, it might very well prove your kryptonite if you hate searching for hidden items. You'll need to collect the First Wave Compass, First Wave Video Tape, and Old Field Rations, all of which you can grab in the environs of the Scrap Yard. All that said, here's how to complete the Broken Monument mission in Arc Raiders. Reach the hallowed grounds by the Scrap Yard This step completed for me when I reached the south end of the Scrap Yard on Dam Battlegrounds (Image credit: Embark Studios) First off, you've got to head to the Scrap Yard location in the south of Dam Battlegrounds, where you'll then have to find three separate items. This stage completed for me when I entered the south end of the yard by all the ruined vehicles and the tires lying on the ground, which is closest to most of the items you need to get.

It was somewhat grounded in reality but also a bit zany too. It had a lot more satirical elements vs the later entries.\" He also, offhandedly, refers to his pitch as \"Saints Row '77\" which might tell you…",

The same can't be said for the game now though, and having spent the weekend running for my life and screaming over proximity chat, REPO really lives up to its horror tag. The 10 new monsters launched as part of this update span all three \"levels\". So, you've got the less-intimidating level one beasts like the new Tick, which resembles a chunky beige bug with big black eyes, or Elsa the dog who is fairly harmless until she takes damage. But then REPO massively ramps up the fear factor by throwing in something horrifying like the Birthday Boy, a character which roams the level placing balloons—which again, seems harmless. But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell. It's a real mixed bag, and with the existing roster of monsters it's quite refreshing to see some new characters pop up rather than cycling through the same bunch.

Confronted with the bloat of today's Windows install, I do wish certain software peddlers had committed to a similar philosophy of 'less is more.' Pleasingly then, one tech tinkerer has pushed Windows 7 to its Lilliputian limits. X user @XenoPanther shared a 69 MB version of Windows 7 x86 that just about boots (via The Register ). Created more just to see if they could rather than as an actually usable OS, @XenoPanther writes , \"Virtually nothing can run due to critical missing files such as common dialog boxes and common controls.\" The punchline, though? The Windows anti-infringement system still works , helpfully declaring that this copy of the OS is not in fact genuine. If you want to noodle around with the outrageously small OS yourself, @XenoPanther has uploaded the file list to Archive.org . It's only the latest in a long line of unofficial attempts to shrink Windows. Last year, we saw another software tinkerer shrink Windows 11 down to only 100 MB by making it throwback to its DOS era.

But it seems this wasn't enough to right Heart Machine's ailing vessel, as the studio began a second round of layoffs late last week. This time the cuts were focussed on the team creating the side-scrolling action/adventure Possessor(s), occurring less than a fortnight before the game is due to launch. The combined layoffs have led some players to question whether to continue supporting Heart Machine financially. In a Steam discussion , user Adam posted that it's \"hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game.\" This was apparently posted in response to the initial round of layoffs, but other users began to debate whether developers who'd had their jobs working on Possessor(s) cut would see a return for their efforts. \"I have no intention of giving money to a company that thanked them for that work by kickin…",

Street Racing Syndicate arrived on PC a year later, and while it was no Need For Speed Underground or Burnout 2: Point of Impact, it found fans among those who enjoyed customizing its roster of licensed cares, free-roaming its Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Miami maps, and outrunning the police. What players didn't like was a bug specific to the PC version that made the sun blindingly bright on daylight tracks. \"HOW TO REMOVE THE SUN? LOL\" asks one poster on the Steam forum, while another laments, \"I guess the developers never heard of windshield visors or sunglasses.\" Wait long enough, and eventually a hero will come along—in this case a modder by the name of Radzerg, who just released a patch with the simple declaration, \"I've fixed the sun\".

Once you see what life is like when the RNG gods are generous, all you will know is pure envy. A handful of lucky players are posting their loot hauls from the new genesis tree introduced in Path of Exile's latest expansion , Keepers of the Flame. Basically, it's a freaky, haunted tree that gives birth to powerful items based on preferences you set. It's only been a few days since it launched and players are swimming in the kind of loot you'd usually have to grind long hours for. I haven't struck gold yet and I'm definitely not jealous of the Reddit users who are posting screenshots of what is the PoE equivalent of finding a stack of Benjamins on the ground. Divine Orbs are one of the rarest currencies in the game due to their crafting value and players who aren't me are finding buckets of them under their Christmas tree from hell. pathofexile from r/pathofexile/comments/1om7okr/x21_divine_drop_from_tree For context: Finding 20 Divine Orbs on day three of the league skyrockets you into millionaire status if you like to trade with o…",

Considering it's on consoles and other storefronts too, Embark might be dealing with a bigger server load than it anticipated. Players are having trouble finding matches and are getting stuck in queue times ranging from 5 to 10 minutes before they're let back in. The subreddit is filling up with posts from players encountering errors and I can see several Twitch streamers waiting to connect. You can actually see a fairly sharp decline in players on SteamDB just after the game hit another all-time high at 337,834 players. It's currently sitting at around 286,000 players an hour after the spike. Plenty of people still seem to be able to play the game judging from the player numbers and ongoing streams, but there's enough commotion that the official Discord server has put a 15-minute timer on how often you can post in the main chat channel.

It wasn't that you were crouched in the middle of nowhere with absolutely zero cover. Definitely not. If you play enough competitive shooters, you'll learn pretty quickly about the tricks graphics settings can play on you. Arc Raiders is the newest shooter with a foliage problem and you might not realize it's holding you back—especially if you're a sweaty PvPer. Knee-high bushes and other shrubbery can be toggled on or off through the foliage graphics setting, and you probably want it on \"low\". YouTuber staycation provides a good example of the difference with some bushes around a car. With the \"epic\" setting, the bushes obscure some of the ground around the edges of the car, which could make it hard to see someone at a distance. The lowest setting gets rid of them entirely, giving you a clean view to line up a shot or catch someone hiding. Notably, the foliage setting doesn't seem to affect the bi…",

Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently. World of Warcraft has historically embraced AddOn creators with open arms, giving a ton of the game's information to them in-client through its API. Crack open the shell of any WoW raider's client and you'll find a homebrew moonshine concoction of custom raid frames, sound effects, and WeakAuras telling them what buttons to push and when.

Here after more than a decade, was an honest-to-god new Thief game, one that brings back Stephen Russell to lend his gravelly tones to Garrett. \"But you don't get to play as him\", the antique shop owner cackled as he handed over the blackjack. \"And by the way, it's a VR game , mwa-ha-ha-haaa!\" As Fraser Brown explained shortly after the reveal , it felt like being slapped in the face, especially when the Thief community has so brilliantly carried the torch (insofar as a Thief fan would ever carry a torch) in the form of unofficial campaigns like The Black Parade . Yet having watched the most recent trailer for the game, which accompanied an announcement for Legacy of Shadow's release date, I wonder whether I was a bit too quick to judge. The trailer shows new protagonist Magpie breaking into a house in New Quarter to retrieve a valuable mask. The moment-to-moment play looks more promising than the brief snippets shown in the original trailer. VR's inherent tactility seems smartly deployed in how it lets you clamber up walls, drag knocked-out enemies around, pick up loo…",

The cooperative shooter proved a disappointment when it released in June, launching in an anaemic state, lacking basic features like in-game voice chat and a tutorial, and generally seeming like a compromised vision despite a few novel ideas. Its first major update, Breakpoint, went some way to addressing these issues , but failed to provide the bump in players Remedy hoped for. Indeed, at the time of writing, just 25 people were playing FBC: Firebreak according to SteamDB . The actual count is likely higher given Firebreak's availability on consoles and Game Pass, but probably not by much. In early October, Remedy issued a profit warning for 2025 due to Firebreak's underperformance. Less than two weeks later, Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, stepped down with immediate effect. Now, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz , Remedy has issued its financial results for Q3 2025, posting a 32% decline in revenue versus Q3 2024, and an operating loss of €16.4 million. Unsurprisingly, Firebreak is the chief culprit, with Remedy recognising a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million due to the shooter's poor performance. Speaking in the report, …",

Vampires to their coffins, zombies to their graves, and humans as far away from here as they can get. The trick is that your tracks can't pass over each other, there's only room for one passenger per car, and there are fixed entrances and exits to each tiny area. The land of \"Trainsylvania\" has over 200 levels for you to figure out, with exactly the kind of thoughtful design you'd expect from Draknek. Which is to say that each area starts off fairly simple, with levels introducing new concepts and ways to use puzzle elements before delivering excellent brain-burning problems to solve with just the same materials you'd found so easily a few levels before.

Which makes sense, given how much the studio has added to it over the course of the Witcher games, like building Witcher schools based on an off-hand reference he threw in before regretting it . The other thing Sapkowski had to say about his relationship with CDPR is that, \"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now. Let's hope it stays that way.\" That was in reference to the lawsuit CDPR settled with Sapkowski in 2019 over royalties, with the author asserting that he'd handed over the rights for a pittance compared to the amount they ended up being worth.

Responding to an article by IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine about the videogame Love and Deepspace's failure to account for nonwhite characters when lighting scenes, Zelle highlighted how Volition handled that challenge in Saints Row: The Third, Skinballs. Skinballs was made up of four spheres, each textured in a different flesh tone and used by artists to ensure scenes were properly lit for characters of all potential skin colors. Borman, the director of digital preservation at the Strong, expressed his own appreciation for Skinballs , and noted that it's become a bit of a memetic delight in various mod communities, sort of like that purple checkerboard missing texture pattern you see in Source engine games.
