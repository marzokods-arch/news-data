The promise came in a filing made on December 1 (via The Game Post ), the latest step in the legal tussle between Tencent and Sony. Sony filed suit against Tencent earlier this year over Light of Motiram, a game revealed in late 2024 that looked a lot like Horizon Zero Dawn ; Sony took that characterization a step further in its lawsuit, calling Light of Motiram a \"slavish clone\" of the Horizon games.

For my money: obviously the latter, but I guess we can finally put that old chestnut to bed, as is often done with chestnuts. Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser—who left the studio in 2020—has been on the interview circuit recently, promoting his new novel, and in the process of a recent chat with The Guardian , settled the debate for good: the Grand Theft Auto games are \"not as good as Dickens.\" Case closed. Wrap it up, GTAilures. Alright, yes, I am having fun with words. While Houser does think the GTA games aren't as good as ol' Dickens, he made the statement while making a broader point about how he approaches writing and designing them, which is more interesting but less funny. Recalling the time he was doing interviews to promote GTA 4's expansion packs, he remembered a French journalist telling him, \"Well, the Grand Theft Auto games are just like Dickens!\" That stuck with Houser. \"I was like, 'God bless you for saying that!'

Does the New California Republic bring Vegas under its control? Does Caesar's Legion turn it into a new Rome? Does Mr House outplay them both and secure his own, autocratic rule? Or (the correct answer) do the people of New Vegas shake off all these encroaching bureaucrats and tyrants in the Independent, or Yes Man, ending? We have our answer: none of the above. In an interview with IGN , Fallout season 2 executive producer Jonathan Nolan said that the show had deliberately taken \"the fog of war approach\" to picking a canon ending for the original game. He seems quite pleased with the choice, calling it \"an absolutely brilliant way to make a bit of an end run around that whole question.\" In other words, 15 years after the end of New Vegas—when Fallout's second season takes place—everyone…",

In a chat with our Elie Gould ahead of the release of Fallout season 2, the conversation alighted on the topic of what faction Howard would sign up with if he happened to wake up in the Wasteland tomorrow. His answer? The Brotherhood of Steel. \"I usually say the Brotherhood,\" Howard mused, \"because they have the best toys. I feel like I could use some power armour.\" Which, alright, fair enough. Being ensconced inside a bipedal tank probably would be quite useful in the grim, post-apocalyptic future. However, I'm afraid it's still the wrong answer.

Given the huge success the game has gone on to enjoy, ongoing support seemed inevitable. According to PC Gamer's official data partner, Newzoo , Ball X Pit has accumulated at least 744,000 players (with a majority on Xbox, where the game was available on Game Pass). But even still I'm surprised how much developer Kenny Sun has announced for 2026. Coming soon is not just one update, but three, spread out over the first half of the year. (Image credit: Kenny Sun) We'll be getting the Regal update in January, the Shadow update in April, and the Naturalist update in July—all of them free. What each one will specifically contain is still a mystery, but between them we're promised they'll add new balls, characters, buildings, evolutions, \"and more\". Will all that lure me back? I could definitely see it. For me, the fun of Ball X Pit was in the novelty—steadily unlocking more and more game-breaking features and seeing how far…",

If that doesn't sound revolutionary to you, you must not understand that the true endgame of every MMO is fashion. In all seriousness, it's actually a pretty huge move. Previously, FF14's glamour system, which allows you to layer sets of appearances over your current gear, only permitted you to do so with gear that can be equipped by your current job and level. Starting with Patch 7.4, this will no longer be the case, opening up a whole new world of fashion options. This came as a surprise to players, due to the game director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P)'s past stance on the issue—even in the face of job-agnostic gear that was increasingly allowing players to throw plate armour onto their White Mages. Talking to Famitsu in an interview, Yoshi-P reveals why (note: these quotes have been machine-translated): \"I felt more strongly than anyone else that we had to cherish the Final Fantasy worldview. I felt that the way Final Fantasy ​​should be is for Dragoons to be able to equip their character in that style, and to be able to hold their spear and strik…",

I think I've tested every single combination of controller and NAND flash found in all of the top-end PCIe 5.0 SSDs at this point. At least all of them, trying to match or break parity with Sandisk's WD SN8100 , that is, all pinching a little bit of the drive's tech while they do it. Yet this is the first SSD I've found that kind of does manage to do that, yet in a very weird, roundabout way. This latest batch of Kingston Fury Renegade G5 drives, including this particularly boisterous 8 TB unit we have on display here, touts exactly the same NAND flash and controller combo as found in the SN8100. But, of course, all dressed up in a Kingston skirt. And I'll be frank, it works really, really well. Arguably unsurprisingly, given it's the same hardware combo that catapulted the SN8100 into our best SSD list. It's been well documented at this point …",

This time we're opting for scales rather than feathers in the My Pet Dragons mod , which does exactly what it says on the tin—adds dragons to the game. Lots of them, too. While this mod might not be as popular among players, it certainly feels just as exciting. The My Pet Dragons mod adds over 500 variations of the little critters to your game, with some spawning in specific biomes and in the Nether. You'll be able to find everything from Ice and Fire dragons to Demon and Lucky Block species (whatever that means) and tame them before embarking on some pretty intense training. After all, you don't just want a cute pet, you probably want something that can take down at least some of Minecraft's many mobs. Yes, before you ask, you can use the dragons as mounts, too. So, similarly to the owls mod, you'll be able to craft a carriage for your dragons to carry you around on, ridding the need to trek to the End and get yourself an Elytra. Plus, there is just something inherently cool about being carted around by a little dragon. It's not all abou…",

Something that's slightly interesting, or some weird quirk that the manufacturer has tweaked a certain way that's led to some curious performance metric in one manner or another. With the NQ780, though, that's kind of not the case. It's interesting, sort of, in its own way, because it's not really that interesting. In a world of blisteringly quick PCIe 5.0 drives like the SN8100 , intuitive new controller designs, limit-breaking NAND flash technologies with a quadrillion layers up-down, left and right, the NQ780 just kind of exists.

One person who isn't quite so pessimistic, though, is the CEO of IBM, Arvind Krishna. Krishna recently spoke with Nilay Patel, EIC of The Verge, on the Decoder podcast and sounded optimistic about the future of AI—which is, to my ears at least, quite refreshing, even if I don't agree on all points. In particular, although he does explicitly say \"no\", we're not in an AI bubble, his explanation, at least on my listening, doesn't seem to completely rule out this possibility; rather, it explains how such things aren't all-or-nothing. I say this is \"refreshing\" just because of how one-dimensional a lot of AI talk can be: either 'AI sucks and the bubble's going to burst' or 'AI is an amazing innovation that will revolutionise everything.'

As OpenAI, Meta, and even the US government continue their investment in the technology, fears have sprung up that the bubble will burst and all that infrastructure will come down alongside it. But Arvind Krishna, the CEO of the huge technology company IBM, thinks Nvidia's Jensen Huang has the ability to shift the company if and when the time comes. Talking to The Verge , and responding to the claim that Nvidia could be disincentivised to actually put out new products due to its leading role in supplying AI hardware, Krishna says: \"I think that when you have an incredibly valuable company that’s making its profit stream from a few products, there’s always an inherent or organic disincentive to try to modify that. That said, I would never bet against Jensen [Huang]‘s ability to disrupt himself and go towards the next plateau, if there is one.\" Huang founded Nvidia in 1993, and it's been responsible for some of the best graphics cards for decades now, but the last few years represent unprecedented growth for the company.

We're just weeks away from the very first Expedition Project wrapping up, a little over one month into Arc Raiders ' life span, and we've already got people complaining that there's nothing to do. I've heard people proudly proclaim they have max benches, completed all quests, and map events, and that because of that, there \" really is no point other than going in to shoot people .\" How about: \" There isn't a hook to get you to play the game anymore ,\" or that \" there needs to be some real endgame juice \" to avoid serious issues very soon.

Elden Ring Nightreign 's new Shifting Earth event has a special (and somewhat annoying) mechanic called the ' crystal curse ', which inflicts a half-health reduction whenever you enter the castles or ruins in each corner of the map. This isn't ideal since those areas contain the best weapons and are the most lucrative when it comes to farming runes and gaining strength to face the new night bosses. Below, I'll explain what you need to do to complete the event and remove the curse so you can take on those areas at full HP. How to complete The Great Hollow in Elden Ring Nightreign You have to shatter four crystals around the map (Image credit: FromSoftware) Except for giving you an entirely different map, The Great Hollow event inflicts you with the crystal curse, a debuff that reduces your HP to 50% when you enter one of the region's big strongholds or castles. You can try to take these on at half health, but it's a challenge. Instead, to complete The Great Hollow and shatter the crystal curse, you have to find and break four crystals around the map .

It and subsequent Splatterhouse games were novel for their gory horror approach to a genre we more readily associate with street fighting or Ninja Turtles . The series is mostly forgotten to all except a small diehard community, but it turns out Namco had bigger and more ambitious plans for it that never officially materialised. Namco did release one Splatterhouse spin-off in the form of 1989's platformer Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti, a watered down and \"cutesy\" take on the more mature (but still quite tongue-in-cheek) beat 'em up outings. It can nowadays be played via the Namco Museum Archives . But there was another unreleased Famicom Splatterhouse game. That was proven in October when a fully playable ROM of something called Splatterhouse: World was dumped on 4chan. Taking the form of a ye olde 8-bit JRPG, it's a truly fascinating artefact, not least because there are very few horror-themed JRPGs from that era: Capcom's Sweet Home is the only other one that comes to mind. While the October dump was a huge moment, seemingly undeniable proof of Splatterhouse: World's existence…",

And yes, occasionally, as Booker DeWitt, I would eat an entire birthday cake out of a garbage can. So what? A man's gotta heal, and sometimes a man's only option is a trash can behind a desk in a police station where someone, for some reason, threw away an entire birthday cake. Speaking of cakes: that's what our quiz today is all about! I'll show you 10 cakes, and all you've gotta do is type in the name of the game each cake is from. Should be a piece of cake, right?

The server farm next door has way more cash to burn. Just yesterday we were reporting that high memory prices may well continue into 2028 , as Samsung and SK Hynix, who produce roughly 70% of the DRAM currently on the market, are focusing on supplying the enterprise business without dramatically increasing their production capacity. In that same story we reported that Micron, the other big player in memory, is planning to ramp up production that won't be online until late 2028. But now it sounds like those new assembly lines won't be sending any RAM our way even when they're online. You may know the Crucial brand name better than Micron, despite the tech company being established in the United States way back in 1978. Crucial is Micron's consumer-focused brand and has been used on RAM, SSDs, even SD cards for years and ye…",

Sure, melee characters, like Wylder and Raider, are getting big buffs to related passive effects, but I personally have received a huge buff because you can now rename your relic presets. Nightreign has given players the ability to save a relic setup for a while now, and it's incredibly useful to tailor them for different bosses. I have Ironeye set up with a relic that gives his bow poison damage for the bosses weak to that specific element, for instance. Not every boss is weak to poison, however, so it's a good idea to have a few different presets ready. There was one problem though: You had no way of sorting your presets by anything other than the date you saved them, for some reason. The new patch fixes this problem and lets you just name them whatever you want. No longer will I have to frantically skim through each preset to figure out which one is for fire damage and which one is for frost. I can just name them \"fire\" and \"frost\". Nightreign is finally playable. The relic system has been divisive from the st…",
