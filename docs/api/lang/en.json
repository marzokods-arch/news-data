I use Notion and have spent way too much time just setting up my system within the app, choosing the correct icons, and making sure the colors match across my pages. Because I spent so much time tweaking it, I feel like I have to put it to use, so I try to write down as much as humanly possible to achieve that feeling of being on top of things that matter.

As results rolled in throughout the annual broadcast on Saturday (Jan. 25), the Adelaide hip-hop trio’s latest entries pushed them ahead of Eilish on the tally, marking another milestone in the group’s enduring relationship with Australia’s most influential listener-voted chart. Hilltop Hoods have been fixtures of the Hottest 100 since the early 2000s, with songs spanning multiple eras of their career consistently finding favour with triple j voters. Their sustained presence across decades places them among a small group of Australian acts to repeatedly chart in the countdown, reflecting both their crossover appeal and deep-rooted connection to local audiences. Eilish, by contrast, has built her Hottest 100 footprint in a far shorter time frame, racking up entries since her breakout years and becoming one of the most successful international artists in the poll’s recent history. Her run has been emblematic of triple j’s increasingly global scope, particularly as streaming-driven pop and alternative releases have come to dominate recent countdowns. The moment al…",

Before Pharrell became a solo superstar, he and Hugo formed a prolific songwriting duo for years, producing massive hits like Nelly’s “Hot in Herre,” Snoop Dogg’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” Gwen Stefani’s “Hollaback Girl” and Justin Timberlake’s “Rock Your Body.” They also formed two-thirds of N.E.R.D., a hip-hop/rock band that enjoyed its own run of hit albums in the 2000s and 2010s. But in a strongly-worded lawsuit filed Friday (Jan. 23), Hugo accuses Williams — his friend since their Virginia childhoods — of committing a wide range of legal wrongdoing against his former partner. “Williams engaged in self-dealing, concealed material information, and … diverted revenues owed to plaintiff,” writes Hugo’s attorney, Brent J. Lehman of the law firm Munck Wilson Mandala. “Such willful, fraudulent, and malicious conduct warrants the imposition of punitive damages.” Friday’s lawsuit, obtained and first reported by Billboard , isn’t the first legal battle between the two collaborators.

That hasn’t stopped Trump Mobile from thinking about what comes next. According to a company executive, a higher-end “T1 Ultra” may also be in the works.

You’ll still be able to access other inboxes in the Gmail app, just without the full Gmail experience. It’s the end of an era, at least it is for Google-feature stans. For nearly a decade, Google has offered a way to make non-Gmail inboxes feel a lot more like Gmail . That feature is called Gmailify, but it’s now on the way out. According to an updated support page from Google , Gmailify will be discontinued this month. Once that happens, Gmail will no longer apply features like spam protection, inbox categories, advanced search, or enhanced notifications to third-party email accounts such as Yahoo or Outlook.",

That’s easier on the eyes when using your phone in a dark room, but it might not always be what you want.

For many of us, Google Wallet has become the ever-growing storehouse for not just our credit or debit cards but also our passes, IDs, vouchers, and virtually everything else that needs to be conserved digitally. However, as it grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage or sort, which is why Google has been building search functionality for Wallet for quite some time. A little over a year ago, we saw Wallet’s Search UI in its early form .

A global launch is not yet confirmed, but if it pans out, it could potentially democratize Bluetooth trackers and significantly boost Android’s Find Hub network. We’ve seen a handful of Android-compatible Bluetooth trackers released over the years, but the market is largely untapped, if Apple’s success with AirTags is any indication. Motorola recently announced its Moto Tag 2 tracker, but there’s still plenty of space in the market for other Android brands to launch their offerings. It seems Xiaomi has decided to finally enter this space, as a new leak shows off the upcoming Xiaomi Tag. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

When someone asked me for a recommendation — be it someone looking to upgrade to a no-nonsense, feature-packed smartphone, or a tinkerer looking for a platform to play around with — my answer was always a OnePlus smartphone . Between the great hardware, clean software out of the box, and a price tag that skirted well below other flagships, it was the safe recommendation. However, more than that, a OnePlus smartphone has traditionally been a smartphone that was, more or less, fully under your control. If the phone was out of the software update guarantee period, you could install a custom ROM to breathe new life into it. If you didn’t like a software update, you could revert to the previous version. Or, if you just wanted to tinker around with hardware you owned, you could. Unfortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

Now Brief tries to be a travel companion Of all of the things Now Brief is supposed to be able to do, I wanted it to show me ETAs for upcoming events. The idea is simple — Now Brief looks at calendar events with a tagged location, checks where you are, and then works out when you should leave to get there on time. If that sounds familiar to you, that’s probably because that’s one of the many useful things that Google Now did back in the day.",

We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured. With this new workflow, if neither of those are an option, you can type out the name of the specific device you want to get online to initiate pairing.",

Not easier , certainly, but definitely without so many modern-day distractions. Back in 1926, lawmakers in Kentucky first got it into their heads to nominate a bird — the northern cardinal — as their state’s official avian ambassador, and pretty much everybody followed that lead with a state bird of their own .

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud. Stephen found that focus particularly useful for building his confidence to practice in the real world.",

Following an initial tease in September, pre-orders are now open for the company’s Talking Flower toy. Based on a chatty character from Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the gadget will pipe up every half hour or so to tell you the time, quote lines from the game, or just kind of say whatever. An overview video published by Nintendo today explains what the Talking Flower can do. The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button. It seems, well, annoying — and if you’ve played Wonder, you’ll know that’s a faithful adaptation of the character.",

If you have no time to go through all your voicemails, Google’s “Take a Message” feature for Pixel devices can be really useful. If you miss or decline a call, Take a Message can automatically spin into action, informing the caller that you’re unavailable and asking them to record a message. While it sounds like voicemail, the feature uses AI to transcribe the message and automatically store it in your Pixel’s call history, where you can revisit it later. While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well. While very useful in theory, it has reportedly been malfunctioning, letting callers hear you instead of recording their message. Several users have highlighted this issue with Take a Message on their Pixel phones over the last few months. These reports, spotted by 9to5Google , are not limited…",

Somehow, though, I’ve always held out hope that something good was on its way. Until now. With yet another Motorola wearable on the horizon, I’ve decided it’s finally time to give up. I don’t think the Moto Watch will ever figure out its true identity, and I think it’s time we all moved on. Here’s why.",

The majority of the complaints come from Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 users. The reports come from different parts of the world and are not limited to a specific carrier or region. Google was already later than usual when it rolled out the January 2026 update for supported Pixel devices . Perhaps it was a holiday hangover still lingering. But despite the rollout having been initiated over 10 days ago, many Pixel users still don’t have the update. Subreddits dedicated to Pixel phones are rife with users complaining they haven’t received the January update yet. These complaints span across multiple Pixel devices, but we’re seeing the majority of reports for the Pixel 8 and the Pixel 10 series. And these reports are consistent, regardless of whether their devices are unlocked or tied to a carrier. A handful of reports also hint at Pixel 9 or 9a not having received the update either.",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code for a new feature that will let users delete all their contributed incident reports. The option will likely be under Settings &gt; Location &amp; Privacy, and accessing it will remove the association between your submitted reports and your account. Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports. That could soon change, as Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code suggesting Google could soon let users delete all their contributed reports across incidents, road conditions, transit, and trip issues.

That’s a $0.50 increase compared to before this date, when the fee per voice line was $3.99. If you have multiple lines in your plan, the total should reflect on your bill starting this month.

Earlier this month, shadow library Anna’s Archive, infamous for scraping 300TB of Spotify’s most played songs , suddenly lost its main .org domain. At the time, the site’s operator downplayed the situation, saying that domain takedowns for sites like theirs happen often .

Sony is back with another entry in its LinkBuds lineup, and this one is a slight departure from the traditional earbud design. The new LinkBuds Clip are open-ear earbuds that don’t sit in your ear canal or hook over your ear. Instead, they clip onto your ear like a cuff, with the idea being that you can listen to music while still hearing what’s going on around you.",

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

    "body": "TL;DR A screenshot from Samsung’s Good Lock team reveals a dedicated Quick Panel toggle for the Privacy Display feature in One UI 8.5. It’s expected to work with Samsung’s new M14 OLED panel and Flex Magic Pixel tech to physically narrow viewing angles. From an angle, the screen should appear black, while the user still gets a normal, bright view head-on. If you usually buy those dark, grainy privacy screen protectors as soon as you get a new phone, you might want to wait before ordering one for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Samsung seems ready to fix your shoulder surfer problem with hardware, and now there’s software evidence to prove it. After months of rumors about the Flex Magic Pixel technology , a new slip-up from Samsung has effectively confirmed the existence of a built-in Privacy Display. A screenshot shared by the Good Lock team (via Tarun Vats) shows a new quick toggle for this feature in an early version of One UI 8.5 .",

They promise big-screen immersion without permanent installations, and I appreciate not having to climb a ladder to mount anything to my ceiling. The irony is that the best UST projectors still require something many homes don’t have: space. After a week with AWOL Vision’s Aetherion Max, it became clear that I don’t have a room with a wall large enough, or a layout flexible enough, to fully take advantage of what this projector can do. And if a review unit can genuinely make you contemplate the whole layout of your home to try and keep it in use, that’s a really good sign. If you have the room, the Aetherion is one of the most technically impressive projectors I’ve used.",
