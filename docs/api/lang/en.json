    "body": "After three months, some nervy moments, and a celebrity-stacked finale, The Voice named Aiden Ross as season 28 champion. Ross was crowned late Tuesday night, Dec. 16, following a festive rendition of Wham’s &#8220;Last Christmas&#8221; with season 23 winner Gina Miles. Earlier on Monday night, Ross featured among the Top 6 finalists, each of whom was tasked with performing two songs — one contemporary and one classic. Ross went with ABBA ’s classic “The Winner Takes It All,” and opened his finals run with JVKE’s “Golden Hour.” Each coach entered the finale with one artist selected from the Playoffs: Ralph Edwards for Snoop Dogg, Aubrey Nicole for Reba McEntire, Ross for Niall Horan, and Jazz McKenzie for Michael Bublé. Two additional finalists — Max Chambers from Team Bublé and DEK of Hearts from Team Niall — earned their spots through viewer votes. When America’s final votes were counted, Horan once again got the rub of the green. The former One Direction star can now boast three consecutive wins as a coach, becoming the first coach in the history of the show to win their first three seasons. The Irishman is just the second coach (after Blake Shelton) to win three in a row. Ross…",

With the holiday season upon us, and Sabrina enjoying an extraordinary two years in her career, there was every reason for the pop star to kick back and hit the diesel. The pair got along like old barfly buddies at The Ripple Room in New York City, as Meyers enticed his guest to play several rounds of drinking games. The day got away not with espresso martinis, but half-pints of beer. Followed by long drags from a punch bowl of Long Island iced tea, and a game of truth or drink. Who did Carpenter write “Manchild” about? Drink. What was the most unhinged thing she’s done to impress a crush? “I don’t think I’ve tried to impress anyone,” Carpenter responded. “That’s such a boring answer.” Yes it is. Meyers then flipped the question. Someone stole an article of clothing from Carpenter&#8217;s house, we learned, to get her attention. Did it work? Sure did. Carpenter turned the tables and had Meyers sing the “The Star-Spangled Banner,” wearing a serious face. Those high notes, however, were best lef…",

The Opportunities in Research, Business, Innovation, and Technology (ORBIT) challenge is a multi-phase innovation competition designed to empower university and college students to develop next-generation solutions that benefit life on Earth and deep-space exploration. With up to $380,000 in total prize funding, NASA’s ORBIT challenges student teams to bring their most forward-thinking concepts to the table, either utilizing NASA intellectual property or conceptualizing their own. Teams are tasked with conducting targeted research, designing early mockups or models, and performing feasibility analyses to refine their ideas. Finalists then advance to a live showcase where they present their work to a panel of expert judges, who evaluate the proposals and select winners based on the teams&#8217; final pitches and responses to questions. The ORBIT has two challenge tracks for teams to choose from. The ORBIT Earth track requires teams to select a NASA-owned patent and develop novel commercial or nonprofit applications addressing real-world problems. …",

Achieving this slim design required impressive engineering, especially when it came to powering the device without needing to plug it in. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A new “Share network” toggle in Wi-Fi settings will let you decide if other users can automatically access a specific network without re-entering the password. Although currently in the Canary channel, this feature is expected to arrive in a future Android update, possibly the Android 16 QPR3 beta. Android allows you to create different user profiles, each with its own apps, files, and settings, enabling multiple people to share a single device. Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network? Currently, there is no way to choose which networks to share; once you connect, every other profile automatically gains access. Soon, however, Android will provide an…",

They have expertise in the development of complex study designs, the application of modern statistical methods, and the analysis of data collected under NASA operational constraints (small sample sizes, the limited population of astronauts). Fun Fact: Did you know statistics is more than just means and standard deviations? Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, presenting and interpreting data.

Battery capacity is rising to 5,200mAh with 30W TurboPower charging, and Motorola claims up to 49 hours of usage per charge. The phone features a Dimensity 6300 chip, stereo speakers, and support for Dolby Atmos. Buying a budget phone often means making trade-offs. You might get a great screen but a weak battery, or a sturdy phone that takes poor photos. For the past few years, Motorola has tried to solve this problem with its G Power series, and now it looks like the company is making another strong attempt. Motorola has announced the Moto G Power 2026, and while it looks familiar, there are some key changes under the hood that might make it the sub-$300 phone to beat in 2026.",

We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A new Counterpoint Research report predicts that smartphone prices will rise in 2026, with average selling prices increasing by as much as 6.9% as memory costs surge. The same report points to shrinking shipments and higher manufacturing costs, pushing smartphone makers to potentially cut specs like RAM and limit budget options. For consumers, this means phones launching next year will be pricier while offering fewer meaningful upgrades. If you’ve been waiting patiently to upgrade your phone in 2026, hoping the next generation of devices will be faster, cheaper, or offer better value, we’ve got some bad news for you. Smartphones will most likely get more expensive and less featureful in the coming year compared to what you can buy today.",

Stranger still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in particular can be annoyingly inconsistent. Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports.

The workaround gained attention after employees and customers shared tips about paying cash to bypass T-Life. With cash now routed through the app, all standard in-store transactions appear to follow the same T-Life process. Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

    "body": "TL;DR The budget-focused handheld maker MANGMI has revealed its next device, called the Pocket Max. It features a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel, plus full-size sticks and front-facing speakers. Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

It’s obviously Android, but it has also long looked and felt distinctly “Samsung,” even as other Android skins borrowed ideas from all over the place. With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co. Ltd., who will hold the rights collectively under the name Picea.",

Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts.

It also simplifies sharing between apps, meaning developers don’t have to build their own data transfer tools. When Google launched Health Connect in 2022, it supported just over 40 data types across six categories.
