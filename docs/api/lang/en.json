If you’ve been wondering why Google’s viral image editor ended up with the nickname “Nano Banana,” the mystery’s over. The team says the moniker started life as a throwaway placeholder, and then the internet refused to let it go. On the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast , product lead David Sharon explains that the model’s official name is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. However, when a Product Manager named Nina submitted the model anonymously to the LM Arena benchmark website, allowing users to test it out, she had to enter a temporary label that kept it anonymous. At 2:30 in the morning, “Nano Banana” popped into her head. The next thing they knew, the model had gone viral, and people kept using the playful name, so Google ultimately embraced it in public.",

Enabling the service is free, but you’ll need to sign up via T-Mobile’s enrollment page. Text to 911 works on most recent phones with satellite connectivity, although some iPhones and Pixels have their own version. If you spend time hiking, driving cross-country, or exploring anywhere off the grid, this one’s worth knowing about. T-Mobile now lets anyone text 911 via satellite , even if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;T. The important thing to know is that you’ll need to sign up first, as it’s free but not automatic. In its press release , T-Mobile explains to those unfamiliar that the Text to 911 feature is part of its T-Satellite system, which connects phones directly to Starlink’s 650-plus low-Earth orbit satellites. That network covers roughly half a million square miles of the US where normal cell service doesn’t reach. Once you’ve enrolled, your phone will automatically connect to “T-Mobile TXT911” when you’re outside tower range, showing a satellite icon on Android or “LTE” on the iPhone 13.",

First teased earlier this year, the company finally revealed the Pocket VERT earlier today in the YouTube video shown above. As promised, it’s a glamorous take on the Game Boy, with a CNC-machined body and “diamond-cut” shoulder buttons.

The mode saves power, keeps the device cooler, and can help reduce OLED burn-in during long downloads. It works automatically when plugged in and can be enabled on battery, although it pauses when the charge level is below 20%. While the handheld gaming space has become crowded, the Steam Deck remains a community favorite, thanks in large part to Valve’s steady stream of thoughtful software updates. That momentum continues with a highly-requested new feature. Valve has rolled out a new update that brings the ability to keep downloading games even when the screen is turned off. Now rolling out to the Beta and Preview channels, the feature is enabled by default when the Deck is plugged in; however, you can also enable it manually on battery via Settings &gt; Power .

The device brings streaming, smart-home integration, and Dolby Audio to a budget-friendly package. It builds on Aurzen’s earlier D1R Cube projector with refined features and a lower price point. Aurzen’s earlier D1R Cube introduced Roku’s first projector integration and delivered 1080p resolution, Dolby Audio, and auto-focus and auto-keystone correction at a price of $249.

Samsung launched the Galaxy XR headset in the US and South Korea last month. While the $1,800 price tag makes it a tough sell for many people, there’s still considerable interest in this new form factor and the Android XR platform.

But there are some days when I’m still jealous, furious, and furiously jealous of Apple’s influence on the entire mobile ecosystem. See, not only did a few Android brands decide to adopt Liquid Glass-like influences in their own Android skins (I’m looking at you, vivo and Xiaomi), but more and more app developers are already adopting the design language in their iOS apps, too.

    "body": "TL;DR Apple is reportedly working on a lower-cost Mac laptop that could sell well under $1,000 by using iPhone-class chips and a smaller LCD. The project signals a strategic push to compete with Chromebooks and affordable Windows laptops, especially in education, where Apple currently trails rivals. If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.

It survived all durability tests, booted up afterward, and even includes oil in the coolant for a lava lamp visual effect. Some people might see a phone with visible coolant sloshing around inside it as an accident waiting to happen. However, Zack Nelson of JerryRigEverything proves that the new REDMAGIC 11 Pro is anything but, as he reveals the secrets to what he calls “the most powerful phone on the planet.” In his new video , Nelson dismantles what REDMAGIC calls the world’s first mass-produced liquid-cooled smartphone. The 11 Pro’s blue coolant can actually be seen circulating the back when the phone is switched on, pumped by a microscopic piezoelectric motor that pushes liquid through a sealed loop. The system works in tandem with a 24,000 RPM internal fan and what Nelson describes as the largest vapor chamber he’s ever seen in a phone.",

Google is also testing new toggle for Live caption and a new Search Live shortcut in the AI Mode. Google is not leaving any stone unturned in ensuring that people not only rely on its AI products but also depend on them in the same way they depend on Search. That is why Google has been pushing Search features like AI Mode and Search Live parallel to Gemini and Gemini Live, offering comparable functionality with and without the benefit of results from Google Search. As you might have guessed, Search Live lets you obtain search results that are fine-tuned in real-time while interacting with it using voice or video. While the feature is still relatively new , Google is gradually adding features to make it useful to a broader set of users.

Telecom carriers often battle over broader coverage, the number of zip codes covered by 5G , and faster speeds. These claims, based on the carriers’ own marketing teams, paint a picture that’s far from the actual scenario and are often even contradicted in actual reports by independent parties . However, while it’s natural for corporations to paint a brighter picture, Google has been found colluding with carriers, allowing them to display fake signal strength on your phone. Beyond tall marketing claims and fake 5G icons , carriers may also be lying through their teeth to you about signal strength.

Even before the One UI 8.5 beta has been released, I’m genuinely rooting for this option to be a reality and feel it could be a dramatic improvement — beyond visual appeal — to the panel that One UI has seen in recent years.",

Remix allows users to generate unique images from prompts using attached photos within chats. Remix will be available in the media picker and by long-pressing an image, but may have a daily use limit when it rolls out in the near future. Google’s recent “ Nano Banana ” update to its image editing model has been a wild success, with many praising it for its ability to retain likeness across generated images. We’ve previously spotted Google doubling down on its success and working to add Nano Banana to apps like Google Photos and even Google Messages . The latest update to Google Messages, 20251031 beta, includes fully fleshed-out code that enables this new Nano Banana-powered Remix feature within the app. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

It recently announced that users will be able to uninstall pre-installed Meta apps, such as Facebook and Instagram, from their devices. This change will be introduced with the upcoming Nothing OS 4.0 beta update, scheduled for release by the end of the month. If there’s one peculiar characteristic of the Carl Pei-led tech brand Nothing, it’s the propensity for unusual choices and hot takes. The brand has consistently also maintained a strong stance on privacy. That is why its recent decision to include certain third-party apps on some of its phones from the factory sparked strong opposition from users. Now, it seems the brand is taking a half-step back and will allow users to delete some of these apps — but will continue to install them on some non-flagship phones. Nothing just shared an update on the recent controversial change in the Android 16-based OS 4.0 for the Phone (3a) series.

    "body": "TL;DR Google has pulled its Gemma model from AI Studio after it generated a false claim about Senator Marsha Blackburn. Blackburn issued a formal letter accusing the model of defamation; Google says Gemma wasn’t meant for factual consumer use. Gemma remains accessible via API for developers, while the incident raises bigger questions about accountability and guardrails in public-facing AI tools. Google’s Gemma large-language model was introduced as a next-gen AI companion inside its AI Studio platform, designed to support developers with text generation, creative drafts, summaries, and more. It represented Google’s broader push toward open experimentation with its advanced models, until everything hit a snag. Google has now quietly pulled Gemma from the public developer interface. First reported by TechCrunch , the move follows a formal letter to CEO Sundar Pichai from Senator Marsha Blackburn , a Republican from Tennessee, who said Gemma produced a fabricated allegation when prompted with: “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?”",
