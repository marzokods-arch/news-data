His latest single — “Rebel,” which Stoney Creek released to country radio via PlayMPE on Oct.&nbsp;30 — takes on the good-guy stereotype, imbuing it with notable power. “Sometimes in our society, the wrong things get glorified,” Baldridge notes. “It’s hard sometimes when you’re trying to stand up for good things and you see [the] wrong things get glorified.” Around March 2024, he reached out to one of his “Tough People” co-writers — fellow artist Adam Sanders, currently a competitor on th…",

I just want to lay out the facts and be clear: YouTube pays the least for music, full stop. They always have and always will unless someone stands up to them. They’ll throw up smoke screens and tempt you to look the other way, but let’s not be fooled. YouTube recently touted that it paid artists $8 billion over the past year. This sounds impressive, but it’s not. During the same period, Spotify generated roughly $18 billion in revenue and paid about $12 billion to music rights holders — nearly 67% of its revenue. By contrast, YouTube generated $60 billion in revenue and paid only $8 billion to rights holders — about 13%. YouTube will say they’re not just a music service. But I would argue that YouTube never would have become such a successful platform without music, and even if only one-third of their revenue comes from music (and it’s likely higher), they certainly should be paying more than Spotify, not 50% less.
