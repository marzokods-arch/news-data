To me, that was Fallout. So, that was the first thing, the first asset. The next iconic thing was the Pip-Boy. It's kind of an abstracted thing in the early games.

Then it was the Vault suit…\" Bethesda's take on the Vault suit, incidentally, is a little more straightforward than the original designer intended: Tim Cain recently spoke about how his idea was that the suits would be \"extruded\" from a machine on demand .

In light of those good times, I'm very happy to hear that Ontos aims to go even harder on that more cerebral take on horror. \"In your more standard horror game, say the first Amnesia, the focus is to have players survive in a scary environment. The intent is to evoke a very primal sense of fear,\" Frictional Games creative director Thomas Grip told GamesRadar . \"In Ontos, the focus is more cerebral. It is about encountering strange, often very disturbing, situations where the player is tasked with figuring out the best approach.

    "body": "I've covered CES for years and each one feels different to the last. Some are great for PC gamers; others aren't. This year, prototypes, concepts and artificial intelligence dominated the show, which is not surprising, nor different to last year. Though I have seen a bit of a trend in how people are reacting to this year's show. From the comments on my CES live blog , to those on TikTok, to various threads on Reddit, to our own reaction on team; gamers keep saying similar things. 'Everything is too expensive' is a common response to any announcement from the show. With RAM prices skyrocketing and this being leveraged for price increases elsewhere, there is a sense of existential doom across the entire PC building market. Things aren't that bad—not yet—but it's going to be a bumpy ride for the rest of the year, if not longer, as prices are still on the rise. I've been scrolling through CES coverage on TikTok and YouTube and sticker shock—the gut reaction to finding out a product's high price—is a constant. Then there's AI. It wouldn't be CES without a buzzword and that buzzword has been AI for multiple years. So consider me very-not-surprised that, in 2026, we're still talking abou…",

Asus has partnered with boutique headphone manufacturer Hifiman to bring planar magnetic drivers to its new gaming headset, the Asus ROG Kithara . For those not in the know, planar magnetic drivers use a magnet-suspended diaphragm to deliver exceptionally crisp and accurate audio, which makes them highly-prized among audiophiles. Our best audiophile headphones pick, the Audeze Maxwell , uses a similar pair—but it looks like there's some new competition in town. I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows. Watching a clip of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay, the impact sounds were pretty jawbone-rumbling. The open-backed wired set was plugged in to a substantial DAC/amplifier combo, so they were obviously being pushed quite heavily, but boy did it make for some serious air movement. The soundstage seemed plenty wide, too, which should make for some great atmospheric audio. Asus says the frequenc…",

From here, the attacker could have a pretty serious level of access to your rig. As shared in the security record , this problem is of high severity, with a score of 8.5.

Except, that is, for monitors and what looks to me like the most exciting gaming display of 2026. I give you the LG UltraGear Evo 39GX950B , all 39 inches of it. This new gaming monitor has so much going for it. It gets LG's latest OLED panel tech (albeit minus the RGB-stripe subpixel layout ) and a 5K2K native resolution. That's 5,120 by 2,160 pixels. It's basically a 4K 16:9 pixel grid taken out to 21:9 aspect ultrawide. More specifically, it's essentially a 32-inch 16:9 monitor stretched out to 21:9. That means the 140-ish DPI pixel density is the same as a 32-inch 4K panel. Personally, when it comes to the best compromise between crispy precision for day-to-day computing and maybe creative workflows, overall panel size for immersion and tolerable GPU load for gaming, 32-inch 4K makes more sense than 27-inch 4K. The latter has better pixel density, for sure. But that's barely noticeable for games, and yet you will feel the smaller, less immersive panel size. And 32-inch 4K is still pretty sharp and offers really nice fonts …",

Having learned a great deal about indie game development over the last five years, Knight, now the CEO of Kinetic, believes it's time to put that experience to use to help other independent developers. \"The fact we’ve grown so much as a company means we’re now in the place where we want to support studios who come under our wing, and provide the support I'd have appreciated at the start of my journey\", says Knight .

If you're wondering what this is all about, a quick refresher: Larian unveiled Divinity , its next game, at The Game Awards 2025 with a shockingly dark, brutal trailer that reminded us all that Baldur's Gate 3 got rolling the same way before all the, y'know, sex . But the studio's big moment went awry just days later when Vincke said in a Bloomberg interview that Larian was experimenting with generative AI in the early stages of game development, and that developers at the studio were happy about it.

While it'd be hard to think of a Fallout game without VATS underlying it, linking gunplay to the classic RPG elements of its predecessors, Fallout 3—the first Fallout game after Bethesda acquired the licence—almost threw the gunplay out with the… uh, gunwater. I've lost track of this metaphor. That's per an interview in the latest issue of Edge (thanks, Gamesradar ).

In Dogpile, it's the point when two dogs of the same type touch and, with a chirpy little bark, merge into one bigger, higher value dog. And if that new dog should happen to pop into existence already next to another dog of the same type, and start off a chain reaction of merges that jostles the whole pile around into an avalanche of yaps… oh boy, that's doggy heaven.

But here we are, CES in January 2026, and Intel's new Panther Lake chip isn't just the most exciting launch. It's virtually the only launch. Nvidia is obviously utterly consumed by all things AI, plus maybe a touch of memory crisis management. So, there were no new GPUs from Team Green . And AMD had nothing but respins of existing products . I suppose you could point to Qualcomm's second-gen Snapdragon X2 chips as something exciting. But the whole Arm-on-PC thing still has so much to prove, the jury isn't just out, it hasn't even been vetted yet. Which leaves Intel and Panther Lake. Being pretty much the only genuinely new PC chip at CES means you could get the impression it wins the excitement prize simply by default. It comes first in a race of one, in other words. Strictly, that's true. But Panther Lake is also genuinely exciting for several reasons. For PC gaming, it's the new Arc B390 iGPU that's most compelling.

However, Panther Lake's official launch at CES has given both Intel and AMD ample room to take potshots at each other. Talking to Tom's Hardware , AMD SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, spoke about Panther Lake. Tikoo said \"Strix Halo or Ryzen AI Max will kill it\" and that \"it's not even a fair fight at that point.\" He added that AMD's top-end chips are \"better than that in terms of graphics performance\" and that those looking for gaming will be buying gaming-specific chips anyway. In terms of performance, Tikoo points out Intel's benchmark results for Panther Lake were compared to lower-end and older Ryzen chips: \"They compared their highest-end to our midpoint.\" Earlier this week, Intel reported that its Core Ultra Series 3 Panther Lake chips are up to 77% faster in regard to gaming performance than Lunar Lake.

There is a bit more nuance to be gleaned beyond that eye-watering figure, though. To begin with, Samsung's full earnings guidance offers the estimated range of \"19.9 trillion to 20.1 trillion Korean won\" for operating profits and \"92 trillion to 94 trillion Korean won\" for sales. Yeah, okay, that is still a lot of won. The guidance goes on to note that only offering ranges doesn't square with Korean disclosure regulations, hence the '20 trillion Korean won' figure.

    "body": "Both Samsung and LG, the two big makers of OLED screens that go into TVs and monitors, announced new panel technology at CES 2026 with 4,500 nits of peak brightness. Question, will that tech appear in a PC monitor any time soon? The answer is yes and no. Yes, the technologies seen in the new panels are headed for PC monitors. But, no, you can't expect to see PC monitors anything like that bright. One useful reference point here is that existing TV OLED panels are already rated at up 4,000 nits, with these new-gen OLEDs bumping that up to 4,500 nits. Existing OLED monitors, meanwhile, get nowhere 4,000 nits, typically topping out at 1,300 nits. So, OLED monitors based on a given equivalent generation of panel technology are much less bright on the desktop than their TV compatriots. We'll come back to the reasons why, but let's just cover off what the two big panel makers announced at CES this year. Samsung's latest QD-OLED panels aren't a radical departure. The emissive material is revised rather than a fully new generation. All told, Samsung is claiming 4,500 nits peak HDR brightness for small screen areas with 450 nits full-screen brightness. That is dramatically higher than its …",

I recommend you have a gun and a good bundle of bullets with you, as you're likely to run into some monsters on the way. Plus, you'll be right next door to the Stabilizer blueprint location , so you can nab that too. StarRupture Helium location Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Creepy Jar) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Creepy Jar) While there are multiple deposits across the planet, the best place to find Helium-3 deposits in StarRupture is almost directly east of the lander where you start the game , near the Grubbler trees at the base of the mountain. Here you'll find two Helium vents that you can start harvesting. Take note that you'll need a Helium-3 Extractor , unlocked by reaching level six with the Slenian corporation, not the standard Ore Excavator.

Just like the Rotor and Tube blueprints to the northwest and the Stator blueprint in the north, the first few schematics are a short hike from the orbital lander where you'll have established your first base. The Stabilizer blueprint specifically is also near the best Helium location , which you'll soon need for new recipes, so I recommend checking it out while you're in the area. Beware that there are enemies in the area, so you should at least craft the starter Reaper pistol and a few hundred bullets. Alternatively, there will be no enemies here for a short while after a Raptura event (a solar flare, basically) when the planet is scorched.

In a post to the official Minecraft news blog , it was revealed that baby mobs will be getting an entirely new appearance. Prior to this drop, all baby mobs were just downsized versions of the fully grown model, with massive heads. Now though, this new look gives them single pixelated eyes and, depending on the mob, an entirely new model, like the little yellow blocky chick rather than a small chicken. According to game director Agnes Larsson, Minecraft's artists have given each mob \"unique textures and models that give each baby mob their own adorable look and identity.\" This applies to all passive mobs which you can breed in the overworld too, like ocelots, all 11 kitten versions, rabbits, all your standard farm animals, and wolf pups.

I hate inventory management and Arc Raiders is particularly bad at it: You're constantly bottlenecked on upgrades by a shortage of some items, while at the same time having an overabundance of other things you may or may not need later. Yes, it's deliberate and by design. But other extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov, despite being on a different level of brutality than Arc Raiders, at least have a player economy where you can fudge through some of the worst by selling and buying. Despite Arc Raiders being quite happy to connect players in-game, there's no means to swap or sell key items in order to get the stuff you really need. I think that, within reason, it's a problem the game should seek to address—and it seems to me that every player would be all-in on it. Anyway, in an interview with Games Beat , Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund talked about player to player trading and the news is that, basically, it will be coming. But not soon: \"We're going to want to do …",

I'm creeping through sand-swept streets at night as gunshots ring out in the distance and flares start flying, then all of a sudden a Rocketeer starts hounding me in and out of houses, and I narrowly escape down a subway. It's impressive, especially for a multiplayer game. Some creative players took advantage of this and traded guns for binoculars, making incredible on-field reporting and even short films , all recorded inside the game—no CGI or greenscreen required. I suppose it was only a matter of time, then, until Hollywood tried to capitalise on Arc Raiders' sudden success. As Embark Studios' CEO Patrick Söderlund explains in a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi, the team has already received offers to adapt gaming's latest hit to the big screen, even though it's barely even two months old at this point. \"I can't tell you how many companies have reached out to us wanting to make a TV series or movie out of this IP\", Söderlund says, without naming any names. Söderlund goes on to clarify, \"We don't mind doing that, it would be fun. But it has to be done in the right wa…",

I've encountered bloodthirsty raiders who'd fit better in a colosseum rather than Stella Montis, who have challenged me to axe-to-axe combat on threat of death, voiceless raiders who use voice prompts to help me find hidden loot, and battle medics who manage to pop out of thin air to revive me when I get downed by a rogue arc, it seems like Arc Raiders is a sandbox for all sorts of social adventures.

The idea is, you get a virtual 177-inch monitor beamed in front of your eyeballs via a Micro-OLED display within the glasses, covering 95% of your vision with a 57-degree field of view of excellent gaming fidelity.

For a start, there's a substantial cable attached to the rear of the left arm, which makes putting them on a very awkward event. I did it in public and nearly poked myself in the eye, as the glasses seem destined to fall in on themselves as you bring them towards your face. Secondly, they made me look like a dork. Yes, I look like a dork already. You're very funny. But there's something very uncool about wearing gaming shades, especially ones with a fa…",

However, as I'm on the ground at CES 2026, Intel gave me a chance earlier today to put the Arc B390 iGPU through its paces in a brief benchmarking session. I have to say, its performance was pretty impressive—for an integrated graphics solution, at the very least. Due to my packed CES schedule (my fault entirely), I had less than an hour to quickly run some benchmarks and futz around in the odd game. Still, I'm enough of an old hand to know exactly what game I was benching first— Cyberpunk 2077 , of course. My test laptop was a non-descript Lenovo machine with an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H onboard, the top-end Panther Lake CPU from the new lineup. Still, the lack of discrete graphics hardware means I didn't subject the poor lappy to path tracing, or even ultra settings, at least at first. No, this is an iGPU, and expectations should be tempered—Intel says the Arc B390 is around 10% faster on average than an Nvidia RTX 4050, and that's not exactly a lightning-fast graphics card. High settings then, 1200p. No upscaling, no ray tracing. The result? (Image credit: Future) A perfectly …",

Now the two lands exist side by side, but anyone who crosses from one to the other is transformed, no longer quite the same person (or elf or boggart) they were on the other side. This duality is demonstrated in a short film called One Light, One Dark that's basically a Magic-themed Muppet musical, with characters designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop singing about how different their lives are on either side of the twilight border. On the one side, they playfully squeeze frogs. On the other, they murder pigeons. Swings and roundabouts, really. It's delightful is what it is. And while it's also a perfect opportunity for the Fun Police to say how this proves Magic is better when it concentrates on its original setting rather than crossovers, I think I'd be even more stoked if this was a Muppets/Labyrinth/Dark Crystal set.

Tell me a block called \"Cyan Terracotta\" doesn't also sound like a paint color you'd find at Dulux or Farrow & Ball or some other fancy-schmancy paint company. Sounds like a great excuse for a quiz! Below I'll give you some names, and all you've gotta do is tell me if it's the name of a Minecraft block or a luxury paint color . Easy! Or is it?

I have to say, it's an awfully nice machine to experience in person. As I type this piece, I'm sitting in my hotel room using a laptop with a 15-inch display. It's a decent size for gaming, but I'll be honest, juggling tabs around between dual browser windows is a massive pain in the arse. Whereas the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo (2026) looks like a delight to use for just such a purpose. You get two whole 16-inch 3K 120 Hz OLED screens to play with, hinged in the middle like a gigantic book, with the bottom screen holding most of the internals.

While there's a brief tutorial for the early access survival game, you're largely on your own when it comes to figuring out anything but the basics. So if you're looking for the Stator blueprint , an important early production item, you might be wondering where you even begin to search. Thankfully, the Stator blueprint isn't all that far from your starting point—in fact, you've probably spotted the location the moment you stepped out of the landing pod—though you will have to do some running and bug-killing to find it. Make sure you've at least crafted a pistol and some ammo before you head out, but you won't need more than that. StarRupture Stator blueprint location Watch the video above, which begins at the starting zone just outside your lander. Look almost directly north and you'll see a ruined structure in the distance on a ridge . It's hard to see, but it's there—if it helps, orient yourself by looking at the huge metal turbine that dominates the landscape, then swing your view left until you see the structure.

But the drink is spiked, and you end up \"tripping balls\" on magic mushrooms—so if you don't want that to happen, just say no.

The boss health bar doesn't budge like some kind of punishment for pushing it further than the developers intended. YouTuber Swedge , and a few other players, discovered that PoE 2 shares the same damage cap as Path of Exile 1 by lighting bosses on fire for obscene amounts of damage. They put together builds that complement each other by multiplying the damage output to the highest degree. But the result was far from satisfying. If you manage to hit a boss for over 35.79 million damage per second, the game refuses to calculate it anymore.

Nope. My Arc Raiders solo lobbies are as chill and blood-quenched as ever. \"Don't shoot\" remains the preferred weapon of my fellow scrappers, and when the odd murderer does make themselves known, the rest of the server tends to go full white blood cell on their ass.
