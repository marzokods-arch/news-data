    "body": "I have an app for almost everything I could ever need. Whether I’m craving pizza, need to calculate compound interest, find a tailor for a shirt alteration, or check the current Premier League scores, I can accomplish all of these tasks with an app of some description. So naturally, when it comes to customizing my phone’s wallpaper, I’ll use a dedicated wallpaper app . According to a recent reader poll , though, not every Android Authority reader agrees. Most of you get wallpapers directly from the internet, swatting apps like Panels to the wayside. However, there’s a problem with relying on apps and the internet for customization: these wallpapers aren’t entirely yours. With this in mind, I’ve made a point to go a step further with my phone customization and create my own wallpapers to bring a real personal touch to my device. For those who want to do the same, here are some ways I go about this.",

I regularly experience pain in my hand after using my device, but in my opinion, it’s the most natural grip when using a phone one-handed. Notably, it appears that a host of readers agree with me.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Wireless charging has never been a straightforward matter on Pixels, with many recent phones claiming two different speeds whether you were using the official Pixel Stand or a third-party charger. With the Pixel 10 series shipping out of the box with built-in Qi2 and Qi2 25W , we thought things would finally be standardized and that we wouldn’t have to think about which charger we’re using with which phone. Alas, that is far from the truth. I’ve conducted many tests over the past few months and discovered that there are intricate differences between older Pixels and newer ones, and how each of them adapts to different wireless chargers. The takeaway? It’s easy to buy the wrong charger for your phone and, as our surveys have revealed, many of you have fallen for that trap. Here’s what I found out and why that’s wrong.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority Most countries rely heavily on prepaid services as opposed to postpaid services, but the United States has long been an exception. That balance is slowly changing in the US as prepaid adoption is rising while postpaid growth has stalled or even slipped in some cases. The main driver is customer frustration with steady price escalations, including fee hikes, smaller autopay discounts, and direct plan increases. For example, Verizon recently cut its myPlan autopay discount from ten dollars to five dollars, and all three major carriers have raised their infrastructure fees. T-Mobile also stopped including taxes and fees in its advertised pricing. I have argued before that prepaid is now the better choice for many consumers. The real questions are what caused this shift, whether it could have been avoided, and how worried the big three should be about prepaid competitors.",

Just weeks after we covered ViWoods’ unexpectedly ambitious AiPaper Reader, the world’s first reader running Android 16 , the company is already expanding the lineup. This time, it’s adding a splash of color with the AiPaper Reader C, a variant that trades the crisp monochrome Carta panel for a color E Ink display. It’s a trendy pivot, as more and more e-readers get colorful makeovers throughout the market. The move to color should make the Reader C more appealing to anyone who regularly handles comics, illustrated books, children’s titles, or PDFs with charts and diagrams. Color E Ink still isn’t vibrant in the LCD sense, but it does add context that grayscale can’t always capture. As always, a color E Ink panel also reduces sharpness, meaning text and fine lines won’t look as crisp as they do on the monochrome AiPaper Reader.",

Complaints on Google’s support forum and Reddit indicate that the issue occurs only on Android devices. There’s no fix yet, and TeamYouTube has asked people to submit feedback. Just as the time for holiday playlists to be finalized approaches, some YouTube Music Premium listeners say their downloaded tracks have suddenly stopped working. Offline songs that played normally a few days ago are now stuck on a loading spinner, even though streaming the same tracks works without issue. PiunikaWeb spotted the growing number of complaints across Google’s support forums and Reddit. On the support forum, one Galaxy S24 Ultra user says they tried everything from clearing cache and data to rolling back to an older version, but playback still breaks the moment they download anything. Two other forum posters report the same thing, with one noting that disabling downloads entirely is the only way music will play.",

Payouts should start this spring, with affected users eligible for at least $2 via Venmo or PayPal. Payouts will mostly be automatic, but users who can’t receive automatic payments have other options. A couple of years ago, Google settled a lawsuit brought by US states that accused the company of holding an illegal monopoly on Android app distribution, using its position to overcharge users for apps and in-app purchases. Despite Google denying wrongdoing, that settlement is set to pay out $700 million this spring. If you’re owed a cut, you probably don’t have to do much to get it. As reported today by ZDNET , settlement payments are on track to be distributed soon after a fairness hearing scheduled for April 30 of next year. Owners of Google accounts in all 50 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands who made purchases on the Play Store between 2016 and 2023 are included in the settlement. Payments should be distributed automatically.",

    "body": "Credit: Andrew Grush / Android Authority TL;DR Starlink filed new trademarks, including “Starlink Mobile” and “Powered by Starlink”, covering cellular communication services and delivery of video and data to mobile devices. The filings follow Starlink’s growing telecom activity, including its T-Mobile satellite partnership and recent acquisition of terrestrial spectrum from EchoStar. None of this is too surprising, as Musk had previously stated that Starlink may eventually offer full cellular service, though he suggested it was likely a ways off at the time. Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well. This collaboration eventually led to T-Satellite by Starlink , which offers limited connectivity in areas where cellular towers are unavailable. As first spotted by PC Mag , it now appears that a new trademark suggests Starlink’s mobile ambitions likely extend far beyond this. Don’t …",

Smartwatch fans may have spotted a notable omission from this year’s holiday sales. The Mobvoi TicWatch lineup has been a steady presence in the Wear OS world for years, but most of its watches seem to have slipped away from retailers without much fanfare. You can’t currently buy them on either Amazon or Mobvoi’s own website, which seems to be an ominous sign that the lineup is fading out. As reported by 9to5Google , all TicWatch listings on Amazon have essentially disappeared . On Mobvoi’s site, the watches have been removed from the product listings, and even the odd ones that can be navigated to via banners lead to a notice stating that the product is unavailable when you click the buy button.",

So we’ve updated our handset and re-run the tests to find out. Before conducting the stress tests, we re-ran the OnePlus 15 through GeekBench 6 to verify that the phone’s overall performance profile hadn’t changed. The good news is that CPU performance remains just as good, if not marginally better (though a 1.5% to 2% improvement is within the margin of error) than before the update.

Early testing showed incompatibility issues between the two devices, but users confirm the connection now works seamlessly.

One of the new social gaming features introduced with the Nintendo Switch 2 is GameChat, which essentially lets you join a group video call where everyone shares their game screen and camera feed. GameChat lets you see and chat with friends even if they’re playing different games, but it requires external hardware to show your face, as the Switch 2 lacks a built-in camera. Nintendo says the Switch 2 works with most USB webcams, but in our early testing, we found that it wasn’t compatible with the Pixel’s USB webcam mode. Fortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

Founder Nicholas Merrill says the goal is to break the link between a person’s phone identity and their personal data.

Nicholas Merrill is best known for fighting an FBI surveillance order for more than a decade. He has now launched Phreeli, a new mobile carrier that lets you sign up with nothing more than your ZIP code. As Wired reports, Phreeli (pronounced like ‘freely’) runs on T-Mobile’s network, but the real headline is what it refuses to collect. The company doesn’t ask for your name, address, or any other information that could be linked to your phone number. Merrill states that the level of anonymity is legal in every US state, and the ZIP code is provided solely for tax purposes.",

It primarily spreads through APKs distributed via unmoderated channels such as messaging platforms. Once installed, the malware enables hackers to remotely control your device and hide their activities behind fake blank or update screens. Just last week, we learned about a banking malware that exploits accessibility settings on Android to steal your bank credentials in the background. Now, we’re looking at another malware that not only enables remote attacks on Android devices but is distributed freely among hackers as part of a subscription service. Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps. One of the ways that hackers use to achieve that is by creating fake replicas of Google Play Store listings, making users believe they are downloading apps from secure sources when they are actually not. …",

Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.
