To help counter that, Bender says he urges developers to not use generative AI anywhere, even just for placeholders. \"Some people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they'll think, 'It can be a placeholder in this prototype build',\" he said. \"But if that gets done, of course, there's a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping throug…",

And while that DLC remains firmly in the realm of hopes and dreams for now, with a new year now upon us I am here to tell you that the foundation for that rumor has grown somewhat stronger. There are two big reasons for this. The first comes from IGN Poland , which said earlier this week ( Google translated ) that it first heard about this new expansion, \"from someone who has repeatedly provided us with reliable insider information,\" years ago. IGN Poland said it didn't publish anything about it at the time because the information all came from a single source (that's how actual journalism works), but in light of these new rumors it's opted to make the story public. IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could succ…",

Asus has partnered with boutique headphone manufacturer Hifiman to bring planar magnetic drivers to its new gaming headset, the Asus ROG Kithara . For those not in the know, planar magnetic drivers use a magnet-suspended diaphragm to deliver exceptionally crisp and accurate audio, which makes them highly-prized among audiophiles. Our best audiophile headphones pick, the Audeze Maxwell , uses a similar pair—but it looks like there's some new competition in town. I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows. Watching a clip of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay, the impact sounds were pretty jawbone-rumbling. The open-backed wired set was plugged in to a substantial DAC/amplifier combo, so they were obviously being pushed quite heavily, but boy did it make for some serious air movement.

As posted to the Asus security board , \"An uncontrolled DLL loading path vulnerability exists in AsusSoftwareManagerAgent.\" With this, an attacker could mess with the app, \"potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution\". From here, the attacker could have a pretty serious level of access to your rig. As shared in the security record , this problem is of high severity, with a score of 8.5. Luckily, attackers need local access, so that certainly makes the exploit a little less worrisome. In this case, that severity is likely linked to how dire access would be, as opposed to how easy it is to pull off, as needing local access cuts out 99% of the world from your rig. This vulnerability affects 64-bit machines before update v3.1.49.0 or before v1.1.37.0 and ARM machines before update v3.2.50.0.

Except, that is, for monitors and what looks to me like the most exciting gaming display of 2026. I give you the LG UltraGear Evo 39GX950B , all 39 inches of it. This new gaming monitor has so much going for it. It gets LG's latest OLED panel tech (albeit minus the RGB-stripe subpixel layout ) and a 5K2K native resolution. That's 5,120 by 2,160 pixels. It's basically a 4K 16:9 pixel grid taken out to 21:9 aspect ultrawide. More specifically, it's essentially a 32-inch 16:9 monitor stretched out to 21:9. That means the 140-ish DPI pixel density is the same as a 32-inch 4K panel. Personally, when it comes to the best compromise between crispy precision for day-to-day computing and maybe creative workflows, overall panel size for immersion and tolerable GPU load for gaming, 32-inch 4K makes more sense than 27-inch 4K. The latter has better pixel density, for sure. But that's barely noticeable for games, and yet you will feel the smaller, less immersive panel size. And 32-inch 4K is still pretty sharp and offers really nice fonts …",

It's safe to say that this success came as a surprise to the at-the-time solo developer Daniel Knight. Now a team of over 30 developers known as Kinetic Games, the studio has revealed the launch of its new publishing label, aptly named Kinetic Publishing. Having learned a great deal about indie game development over the last five years, Knight, now the CEO of Kinetic, believes it's time to put that experience to use to help other independent developers. \"The fact we’ve grown so much as a company means we’re now in the place where we want to support studios who come under our wing, and provide the support I'd have appreciated at the start of my journey\", says Knight .

Your job is simple: you must turn around the last remaining video rental store and make it profitable in the face of a new challenger, RentNet—a digital streaming service that's well before its time. Yes, you have to change the tide of history to save VHS and the adorably tacky 90s arcade aesthetic. Either by yourself or with your friends, you'll need to run the video store and explore the surrounding town of Reshoot Springs on foot…",

Nvidia is obviously utterly consumed by all things AI, plus maybe a touch of memory crisis management. So, there were no new GPUs from Team Green . And AMD had nothing but respins of existing products . I suppose you could point to Qualcomm's second-gen Snapdragon X2 chips as something exciting. But the whole Arm-on-PC thing still has so much to prove, the jury isn't just out, it hasn't even been vetted yet. Which leaves Intel and Panther Lake. Being pretty much the only genuinely new PC chip at CES means you could get the impression it wins the excitement prize simply by default. It comes first in a race of one, in other words. Strictly, that's true. But Panther Lake is also genuinely exciting for several reasons. For PC gaming, it's the new Arc B390 iGPU that's most compelling.

However, Panther Lake's official launch at CES has given both Intel and AMD ample room to take potshots at each other. Talking to Tom's Hardware , AMD SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, spoke about Panther Lake. Tikoo said \"Strix Halo or Ryzen AI Max will kill it\" and that \"it's not even a fair fight at that point.\" He added that AMD's top-end chips are \"better than that in terms of graphics performance\" and that those looking for gaming will be buying gaming-specific chips anyway. In terms of performance, Tikoo points out Intel's benchmark results for Panther Lake were compared to lower-end and older Ryzen chips: \"They compared their highest-end to our midpoint.\" Earlier this week, Intel reported that its Core Ultra Series 3 Panther Lake chips are up to 77% faster in regard to gaming performance than Lunar Lake.

    "summary": "TV and PC OLED panels are related, but not quite the same.",
    "body": "Both Samsung and LG, the two big makers of OLED screens that go into TVs and monitors, announced new panel technology at CES 2026 with 4,500 nits of peak brightness. Question, will that tech appear in a PC monitor any time soon? The answer is yes and no. Yes, the technologies seen in the new panels are headed for PC monitors. But, no, you can't expect to see PC monitors anything like that bright. One useful reference point here is that existing TV OLED panels are already rated at up 4,000 nits, with these new-gen OLEDs bumping that up to 4,500 nits. Existing OLED monitors, meanwhile, get nowhere 4,000 nits, typically topping out at 1,300 nits. So, OLED monitors based on a given equivalent generation of panel technology are much less bright on the desktop than their TV compatriots. We'll come back to the reasons why, but let's just cover off what the two big panel makers announced at CES this year. Samsung's latest QD-OLED panels aren't a radical departure. The emissive material is revised rather than a fully new generation. All told, Samsung is claiming 4,500 nits peak HDR brightness for small screen areas with 450 nits full-screen brightness. That is dramatically higher than its …",

Plus, you'll be right next door to the Stabilizer blueprint location , so you can nab that too. StarRupture Helium location Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Creepy Jar) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Creepy Jar) While there are multiple deposits across the planet, the best place to find Helium-3 deposits in StarRupture is almost directly east of the lander where you start the game , near the Grubbler trees at the base of the mountain. Here you'll find two Helium vents that you can start harvesting. Take note that you'll need a Helium-3 Extractor , unlocked by reaching level six with the Slenian corporation, not the standard Ore Excavator.

Just like the Rotor and Tube blueprints to the northwest and the Stator blueprint in the north, the first few schematics are a short hike from the orbital lander where you'll have established your first base. The Stabilizer blueprint specifically is also near the best Helium location , which you'll soon need for new recipes, so I recommend checking it out while you're in the area. Beware that there are enemies in the area, so you should at least craft the starter Reaper pistol and a few hundred bullets. Alternatively, there will be no enemies here for a short while after a Raptura event (a solar flare, basically) when the planet is scorched.

In a post to the official Minecraft news blog , it was revealed that baby mobs will be getting an entirely new appearance. Prior to this drop, all baby mobs were just downsized versions of the fully grown model, with massive heads. Now though, this new look gives them single pixelated eyes and, depending on the mob, an entirely new model, like the little yellow blocky chick rather than a small chicken. According to game director Agnes Larsson, Minecraft's artists have given each mob \"unique textures and models that give each baby mob their own adorable look and identity.\" This applies to all passive mobs which you can breed in the overworld too, like ocelots, all 11 kitten versions, rabbits, all your standard farm animals, and wolf pups.

It's on the crafting and upgrades side. I hate inventory management and Arc Raiders is particularly bad at it: You're constantly bottlenecked on upgrades by a shortage of some items, while at the same time having an overabundance of other things you may or may not need later. Yes, it's deliberate and by design. But other extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov, despite being on a different level of brutality than Arc Raiders, at least have a player economy where you can fudge through some of the worst by selling and buying. Despite Arc Raiders being quite happy to connect players in-game, there's no means to swap or sell key items in order to get the stuff you really need. I think that, within reason, it's a problem the game should seek to address—and it seems to me that every player would be all-in on it.

Some creative players took advantage of this and traded guns for binoculars, making incredible on-field reporting and even short films , all recorded inside the game—no CGI or greenscreen required.

We've seen classified locations , some old-school Fallout spots , and finally found out one of Fallout's oldest mysteries . But the episode brings something better: Deathclaws. Fans of the games have been waiting to see a Deathclaw in the series since the first episode aired, and even though we didn't even get a whiff of one in the first season, there was a small teaser in the post-credits scene as we saw a Deathclaw skull on the road to New Vegas. (Image credit: Prime Video) \"We didn't do Deathclaws in season 1,\" Todd Howard tells me. \"We wanted to make sure we'd spend the right amount of time to get them right. And really focus on them as a story element, not just another creature. \"But these beasts that are, you know, they're terrifying. And you know what Cooper Howard's experience with that was like, even before he became the Ghoul, with the Deathclaws. Really, really interesting combination.\" We do now know what Coop's experience with these monsters was like, and let me tell you, the wait was worth it because boy, was that first Deathclaw scene sick.

I have to say, its performance was pretty impressive—for an integrated graphics solution, at the very least. Due to my packed CES schedule (my fault entirely), I had less than an hour to quickly run some benchmarks and futz around in the odd game. Still, I'm enough of an old hand to know exactly what game I was benching first— Cyberpunk 2077 , of course. My test laptop was a non-descript Lenovo machine with an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H onboard, the top-end Panther Lake CPU from the new lineup. Still, the lack of discrete graphics hardware means I didn't subject the poor lappy to path tracing, or even ultra settings, at least at first. No, this is an iGPU, and expectations should be tempered—Intel says the Arc B390 is around 10% faster on average than an Nvidia RTX 4050, and that's not exactly a lightning-fast graphics card. High settings then, 1200p. No upscaling, no ray tracing. The result? (Image credit: Future) A perfectly …",

Now the two lands exist side by side, but anyone who crosses from one to the other is transformed, no longer quite the same person (or elf or boggart) they were on the other side. This duality is demonstrated in a short film called One Light, One Dark that's basically a Magic-themed Muppet musical, with characters designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop singing about how different their lives are on either side of the twilight border. On the one side, they playfully squeeze frogs. On the other, they murder pigeons. Swings and roundabouts, really. It's delightful is what it is. And while it's also a perfect opportunity for the Fun Police to say how this proves Magic is better when it concentrates on its original setting rather than crossovers, I think I'd be even more stoked if this was a Muppets/Labyrinth/Dark Crystal set.

The ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 of yesteryear was undoubtedly a cool experiment, but eh, that slim second screen didn't exactly light my world on fire. This new one, though? I have to say, it's an awfully nice machine to experience in person. As I type this piece, I'm sitting in my hotel room using a laptop with a 15-inch display. It's a decent size for gaming, but I'll be honest, juggling tabs around between dual browser windows is a massive pain in the arse. Whereas the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo (2026) looks like a delight to use for just such a purpose. You get two whole 16-inch 3K 120 Hz OLED screens to play with, hinged in the middle like a gigantic book, with the bottom screen holding most of the internals. It's also got a handy, robust-feeling metal kickstand on the bottom to keep the whole shebang in an upright position. It'd fit nicely on a hotel room table I reckon. I could …",

But a group of players found out this week that there is such a thing as too much damage in Path of Exile 2. At a certain point, the game can't calculate the numbers anymore and, instead of pulling a Diablo 4 and going negative , the damage just stops. The boss health bar doesn't budge like some kind of punishment for pushing it further than the developers intended. YouTuber Swedge , and a few other players, discovered that PoE 2 shares the same damage cap as Path of Exile 1 by lighting bosses on fire for obscene amounts of damage. They put together builds that complement each other by multiplying the damage output to the highest degree. But the result was far from satisfying. If you manage to hit a boss for over 35.79 million damage per second, the game refuses to calculate it anymore.
