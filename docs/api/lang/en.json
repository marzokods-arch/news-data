To be sure, tackling songs by one of the greatest pop vocalists of all time is not for the faint of heart and add on the nerves of performing in front of said vocalist and credit is due for any of the artists who even felt up to the task. In general, the performers fell into three buckets: Belters, devotees and innovators. Jennifer Hudson , who opened the show with a medley of Carey&#8217;s hits, including “Vision of Love” and “Make It Happen,” obviously fell in the belter category, as one of the few vocalists with the mighty prowess to power through Carey’s hits. It was an audacious beginning that surely did nothing to quell any butterflies subsequent performers may have had. Also falling squarely in the belter class were Kesha with a spiky version of the swaggering “Obsessed,” Adam Lambert , who delivered an expressive, heartwrenching take on “Can’t …",

The 20-year-old artist tackled the track in-studio alongside his band, just one week after landing inside the top 10 of Australia’s annual Hottest 100 countdown himself. Introducing the cover, sombr praised Dean as “a really inspiring and incredible artist,” adding that the song immediately stood out to him. “It feels so timeless and I love the production, I love the lyrics,” he said. “Everything about it. Amazing.” Originally released by Dean in 2024, “Man I Need” was crowned No. 1 in triple j’s Hottest 100 of 2025, marking one of the year’s most talked-about wins. Sombr’s rendition strips the track back emotionally while reshaping it sonically, layering distorted vocals and a driving indie-rock pulse over the song’s core melody. The Like a Version appearance marks sombr’s debut on the platform and arrives during a breakout period for the New York–based artist. Known for blending alt-pop and indie rock with diaristic, emotionally raw songwriting, sombr has quickly built momentum over the past year with a run …",

Speaking to Attitude , the media personality and businesswoman said discussions are still in the early stages but confirmed that the idea has been floated more than once. “We were talking about doing some fun music. And I was just with her recently talking about music again,” Hilton said. “So, we’ll see what happens. We’ll see.” Hilton, who is currently working on her third studio album, said collaborating with Spears would be a major full-circle moment. “That would literally be the most iconic thing ever,” she added. “That would be a dream come true.” The comments come two decades after Hilton released her self-titled debut album Paris in 2006. She returned to pop music in 2024 with her sophomore record Infinite Icon , which marked a renewed creative chapter for the socialite-turned-singer. Elsewhere in the interview, Hilton singled out Blackout as her favourite Spears album, praising the project for its unapologetic tone. “It was just her being her,” Hilton said. “And she …",

News of her passing at the age of 71 was confirmed on Friday by her manager, prompting an outpouring of tributes from filmmakers, actors, and collaborators across the entertainment industry. O’Hara first rose to prominence as a cast member on SCTV before becoming a defining presence in films including Beetlejuice , Home Alone , Home Alone 2: Lost in New York and a series of Christopher Guest mockumentaries such as Best in Show and For Your Consideration . In the latter part of her career, she became a cultural icon for a new generation with her Emmy-winning performance as Moira Rose on Schitt’s Creek . Director Martin Scorsese, who worked with O’Hara on his 1985 film After Hours , paid tribute in a statement following the news of her death. “Many people know her from Schitt’s Creek . For many others, it’s the Home Alone pictures or Beetlejuice or the Christopher Guest comedies,” Scorsese said. “For me, and for most of my friends, it’s SCTV .

We look forward to building upon those capabilities with many private astronaut missions to come.” Axiom Mission 5 is expected to spend up to 14 days aboard the space station. A specific launch date will depend on overall spacecraft traffic at the orbital outpost and other planning considerations. “The International Space Station is a critical platform for enabling commercial industry in low Earth orbit,” said Dana Weigel, manager, International Space Station Program, NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “Private astronaut missions allow the station to be used as a proving ground for new markets and technologi…",
