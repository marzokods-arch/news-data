In a preview clip from Wednesday&#8217;s (Feb. 4) pre-Super Bowl New Heights podcast, Travis Kelce admitted he did something bad when he laughed so hard at a joke older brother Jason Kelce made about dog shows that he leaned too far back in his chair and snapped some of fiancée Traylor Swift &#8216;s furniture in half. The wood-splitting fall caused his camera to shake as the three-time Super Bowl winner was sent tumbling backwards and then covered his blushing face in embarrassment as he busted out laughing and Jason asked, &#8220;Oh s&#8211;t! Are you alright Trav?&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re good,&#8221; Travis responded as the brothers both grinned about the mishap, with the Kansas City tight end worrying, &#8220;Taylor&#8217;s gonna kill me!&#8221; At that point Jason just absolutely lost it, howling in laughter at the thought of his future sister-in-law taking Travis to the wood shed for splintering her settee. The caption to the preview warned, &#8220;This week&#8217;s episode is dangerously funny,&#8221; promising that the full ep will feature a Super Bowl preview with two unnamed special guests.

We’ve learned that Google is working on a feature called “Characters,” similar to the Likeness feature on the Galaxy XR or personas created with the Apple Vision headset. The exact utility remains unclear, though you may have the option to use the avatar for video calls. It goes without saying, but Google expects Gemini to be present in nearly all walks of your life. And as unusual (or unnecessary) as it may sound, Gemini will also bear the load when you don’t want to appear in front of the camera during video calls. And so, Google is building a feature in Gemini that could let you create your 3D avatars. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Unlike Developer Previews, which were limited to early release cycles, the Canary channel offers a rolling, year-round stream of updates. Enthusiasts looking for the latest features should flash the Canary builds or wait for the Android 17 Beta launching in the coming months. Google launched the Android Canary program for Pixel enthusiasts last year, giving them a chance to try bleeding-edge Android releases before they reach the Beta program. The news was well received by users who don’t mind trading stability for flashy new software features, but some users preferred waiting for Android 17 Developer Previews to roll out. It seems many people missed the memo: there will be no more Android Developer Previews. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

I do have some serious complaints, though. My biggest issue is the lack of ports, but I also found that it requires a factory reset every year or two due to significant performance problems. Acer announced the Acer 4K UHD Google TV Streaming Box in South Africa late last year, and this looked like the answer to my prayers. This Google TV box is made by prominent ODM SEI Robotics, but a closer look revealed that it easily met my requirement for more ports. This theoretically means I can plug in my portable hard drive for no-frills local media playback, or easily plug in a flash drive to transfer APKs. I recently splashed out on the Acer TV box and, after using it for roughly six weeks, here are my thoughts on making the switch.",

Apple is bringing its first foldable to the market this year, and other brands are taking notes. The iPhone Fold is set to depart from the accepted book-style design and instead opt for a wider layout, similar to the first Pixel Fold or the Microsoft Surface Duo. Even before the launch of the iPhone Fold, many Android manufacturers were exploring new or additional foldables with similarly wide inner displays, and Samsung is among them . In addition to the Galaxy Z Fold 8 this year, Samsung is expected to launch a “Wide” Fold, and new evidence suggests it might be available in multiple markets worldwide, including the US.

    "body": "TL;DR Code from the latest Google app beta sheds light on Gemini’s upcoming agentic features on Android. Gemini could help you place orders online or hail rides without you needing to actively touch the phone. While these may be the initial applications, we could see more, as previewed by Google in its Project Astra demo last year. Google could refer to the functionality as “screen automation.” AI agents are the hottest trend in tech , and the increasing momentum leaves no room for doubting that your mobile devices will soon be controlled by them. Back at I/O 2025, Google demonstrated how it plans to put Gemini in charge of controlling your phone for you. This was dubbed Project Astra and showed Gemini’s capabilities at not just viewing the text and media on your phone, but also scrolling and tapping when needed, basically displaying a spectrum of agentic force in action to help you with simple tasks. While Project Astra is still under development, we’re seeing evidence detailing some of its aspects. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

From the age of 8, Scott has struggled with “gender dysphoria,” she explains, and &#8220;assumed I’d just live my life, complain a lot,&#8221; and leave cryptic notes in lyrics. A bad bout of COVID in 2022 left Scott reassessing all of it. “I knew I would always regret not having the courage of my convictions to live my life,” Scott writes. “Seeing so many young people now able to embrace who they are and live authentically without as much bullshit as existed when I was young helped shine a light on the possibility that maybe I can finally be me in my autumn years.” The process to open up and “finally live as myself” has been both liberating and challenging, sh…",

How many smartphone brands will be left by the end of 2026? We are living in what feels like a dangerous time to be a smartphone company, with manufacturers either closing up shop , backing away from flagships , or denying reports of business trouble . It’s almost enough to make you think there won’t be anyone left but Samsung and Apple before you know it. And as we wait to see what fate has in store for these companies, we’re getting some small reassurance that at least one minor player intends to keep going with new phones.

It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto .

TL;DR Google is updating Pixel’s vague Adaptive Connectivity with clearer controls in Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2. There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

This comes after the Galaxy Z Fold 7 reportedly outsold the Galaxy Z Flip 8 last year, despite Samsung originally planning to make more Flips. Samsung traditionally produces more Flip phones than Fold devices in a given year, as Flip foldables are significantly cheaper and tend to see more demand. However, it sounds like Samsung is planning to flip (heh) the script in 2026. Korean outlet ET News reports that Samsung plans to produce more Galaxy Z Fold 8 units than Galaxy Z Flip 8 devices this year.

While Samsung typically launches earbuds alongside its foldables at mid-year, it may release the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro earlier than usual, alongside the Galaxy S26 series later this month. And, the chief focus for these flagship earbuds would be reliability. According to industry sources cited by Korea’s ET News , Samsung’s efforts with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 series aim to regain consumer trust.

Credit: Tom Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR The Nothing Headphone (a) is reportedly launching on March 12, with pre-orders starting around March 5. It is rumored to cost €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is roughly half of the Headphone 1. The leak suggests four color options: black, white, pink, and yellow. Nothing is reportedly about to break the premium-only mold it set with the Headphone 1 . After turning heads with its transparent-design over-ears and solid feature set last year, the brand is now said to be readying a more affordable sibling, and the pricing could surprise you. A new report from Dealabs says the launch is set for March 12, 2026, with pre-orders starting around March 5 (via Notebookcheck ). The big news is the expected price: about €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is about half of what the original Headphone 1 cost at launch. This price drop puts Nothing in direct competition with mid-range headphones from brands like JBL and Sony, which is unexpected for a company known for its premium look and pricing.",

Notably, two rumored colors, Pink Gold and Silver Shadow, are missing from the collection. We’re unsure if that implies these colors have been dropped or will be available in limited quantities. We’re heading closer to the official Galaxy S26 series unveiling later this month. It would be interesting to note how Samsung keeps us engaged during the Unpacked event, especially since most information about the phones has already leaked. And new leaks just don’t stop coming. While the overall designs of the new Galaxy S26 phones have broken cover multiple times, leaks around other tidbits are gaining momentum. And today, we’re looking at the Galaxy S26 Ultra in the different color options. The leak comes from Russian retailer Cifrus.ru , which appears to have listed the Galaxy S26 Ultra in different colors. Although the listings have since been removed, SammyGuru obtained images of Galaxy S26 Ultra renders in various colors.",

Last year, in October, Google announced it was in negotiations with Disney to keep networks like ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV.

Nearby Ring cameras can automatically flag dogs that resemble a missing pet and alert users, who can choose whether to share footage with the dog’s owners. The AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog per day since it launched. Losing your dog is often a panic-inducing event, and you immediately want everyone in the neighbourhood on the lookout. While most of your neighbours would probably like to help, they’re busy with their own lives. Ring is now leaning into that reality by opening up its Search Party for Dogs feature to everyone, whether they own a Ring security camera or not. According to an announcement from the Amazon Newsroom , the AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog a day with their owners since its launch, but it was previously limited to Ring camera owners. With this expansion, anyone can now post a missing dog alert through the app and have nearby Ring cameras hunt for it, even if they don’t have any of the brand’s hardware themselves.",

A surprising report last month claimed that OnePlus may be winding down its smartphone operation, and we polled you on your feelings about it in our coverage. OnePlus has since dismissed the report as false, so it might be nothing, but my colleague Joe Maring argued that losing OnePlus would be bad for Android and the US smartphone industry as a whole.

In fact, it’s much more locked down than the Kindle Fire tablets that allow you to sideload regular Android apps. The Echo line doesn’t enjoy that privilege. But thanks to a new open-source project, you can now jailbreak select Echo Show 5 and Show 8 models and replace Amazon’s locked-down Fire OS with full-fledged Android. Under the hood, Amazon’s smart displays pack similar specifications as mainstream Android devices. For instance, the second-gen Show 5 relied on MediaTek’s MT8163 chip, which also powered the Kindle Fire HD 8 tablet and several budget phones like the Nokia 5.1. However, Amazon has never permitted unlocking the bootloader on its smart displays, keeping us locked to the Alexa-centric Fire OS ecosystem.",

The most buzzworthy is the iPhone Fold , which is expected to debut alongside the iPhone 18 later at Apple’s yearly September event. Much before its launch, the iPhone Fold is already shaping trends with its unusual “wider” aspect ratio and driving Android brands to adopt the same . Apple’s next foldable, however, could be far more conventional. While the first Apple foldable has yet to hit the shelves, the industry is buzzing with speculation about the second.
