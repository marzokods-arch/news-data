    "body": "Midnight Oil ’s Rob Hirst has unveiled a deeply personal new EP, A Hundred Years or More , recorded while undergoing treatment for stage three pancreatic cancer . The celebrated drummer and songwriter, 70, collaborated with longtime bandmates Jim Moginie and Hamish Stuart, and enlisted his daughters Gabriella and Lex Hirst to contribute vocals on the emotionally resonant four-track release. The EP was created in pockets of time when Hirst felt well enough to sing and strum, following a major gastro bypass operation earlier this year. “It’s completely replumbed the inside because the tumour was pushing against the guts and I couldn’t eat,” he shared as per news.com.au . Despite the challenges, the sessions became a space of defiant creativity and familial healing. Gabriella, an artist based in Berlin, delivers the lead vocal on the EP’s title track—a tender, melancholic ballad inspired by Hirst’s diagnosis. “May you live to be a hundred years or more,” she sings, with her father joining for the final line: “May you take another turn around the sun.” “I was just working it up at home with an incomplete lyric and Ella was out for a while looking after me and checking up on all her ar…",
