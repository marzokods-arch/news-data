The threat group, tracked under names including APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Forest Blizzard, and Sofacy, pounced on the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-21509, less than 48 hours after Microsoft released an urgent, unscheduled security update late last month, the researchers said. After reverse-engineering the patch, group members wrote an advanced exploit that installed one of two never-before-seen backdoor implants.

Besides being novel, the exploits and payloads were encrypted and ran in memory, making their malice hard to spot.

FBI agents were able to access the reporter's work laptop by telling her to place her index finger on the MacBook Pro's fingerprint reader, however. This occurred during the January 14 search at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson. As previously reported , the FBI executed a search warrant at Natanson's home as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally leaking classified data. FBI agents seized an iPhone 13 owned by the Post, one MacBook Pro owned by the Post and another MacBook Pro owned by Natanson, a 1TB portable hard drive, a voice recorder, and a Garmin watch.

A conversation with Claude is not one of them,\" Anthropic wrote in a blog post. The company argued that including ads in AI conversations would be \"incompatible\" with what it wants Claude to be: \"a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\" The stance contrasts with OpenAI's January announcement that it would begin testing banner ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the US. OpenAI said those ads would appear at the bottom of responses and would not influence the chatbot's actual answers.

The complaint alleged that Musk quietly acquired a 9 percent stake in Twitter without filing necessary timely disclosures to alert other investors of a potential change in company control. This allowed Musk to acquire over 70 million shares at an artificially lower price, the SEC alleged, causing substantial economic harm to investors selling Twitter common stock, some of whom have separately sued .

But we only got the most fleeting glimpse of the promised new mythical Titan threatening the human race. The full trailer just dropped and rectifies that: It's a gigantic tentacled undersea being dubbed Titan X—and only Kong and Godzilla can stop it. (Spoilers for Season 1 below.) As previously reported , the first season picked up where 2014’s Godzilla left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju —after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. In the S1 finale, Godzilla fights off an Ion Dragon, tossing it through a rift back to the Hollow Earth, and Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) seemingly sacrifices himself to save his colleagues.

At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details \"in the coming weeks.\" Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia's CEO now says the $100 billion figure was \"never a commitment,\" and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year. Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI's Codex , an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex's performance limitations to Nvidia's GPU-based hardware. After the Reuters story published and Nvidia's stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly.

Europol, which is assisting French authorities, said today the \"investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offenses linked to the functioning and use of the platform, including the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity.\" Europol's cybercrime center provided \"an analyst on the ground in Paris to assist national authorities.\" The French Gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit is also aiding the investigation. French authorities want to question Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who quit last year amid a controversy over Grok's praise of Hitler .

The 9-year-old Switch's continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company's third-quarter financial results ( PDF ).

From there, Chromebooks became one of the most popular budget computing options and a common fixture in schools and businesses. According to some newly uncovered court documents, Google's shift to Android PCs means Chromebooks have an expiration date in 2034. The documents were filed as part of Google's long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a verdict in 2024 . While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to The Verge , the company's plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial. As Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser ( which it did ). In Judge Amit Mehta's final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans. Read full article Comments",

The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI's Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes. This is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode. This approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic's model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode's settings, it's possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally…",
