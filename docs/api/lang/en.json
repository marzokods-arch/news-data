Around the 2:30 mark in the Charlotte Rutherford-directed clip, Puth and his wife Brooke Sansone both place their hands on her belly, a sign that changes are coming. “I didn’t leave much up to the imagination there,” he admitted to Fallon. “But yeah, we’re expecting a baby in March.” He’s not giving away the gender just yet, but it’s safe to say the bub will be immersed in music. Puth plans to revisit what him mom did for him, by placing headphones on Sansone’s pregnant tummy. “I hope baby likes music, because it’s the only thing I’m good at,” he quipped. “I think I listened to James Taylor and Luther Vandross, I got a wide array of music.

Irwin gave viewers a little more than they bargained with a perfect dolphin dive early in their routine, and pulled off a floor slide that&#8217;d make Bruce Springsteen proud.

Thousands gathered in several Australian capital cities last Sunday, Oct. 19 for the “March for Australia” rallies, which formed as a collective voice against the federal government’s immigration policies, and for counter protests. Williamson, not for the first time, has called out the unauthorized use of his music. Turning to Facebook , Williamson writes: “‘True Blue’ is a song for all Australians and should not be hijacked by any group that seeks to use the song to sow division. I believe in a multicultural society &#8211; one where all Australians come together in unity to celebrate our unique multicultural nature and freedoms.” A decade ago, the ARIA Hall of Famer put conservative event organizers on blast for attempting to weaponize his famous song. Back in 2015, he shared a post on Facebook in which he noted that “True Blue” was reportedly being used at rallies by various groups including the Reclaim Australia movement, and “did not have my approval to use it.” On that occasion, he wrote,…",
