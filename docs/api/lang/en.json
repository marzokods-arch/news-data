    "body": "I’ve owned some version of a Kindle for well over a decade, and it remains one of the few pieces of technology that I use every single day. Between all its strengths like the unmatched e-ink screen, battery life measured in weeks, and the sheer portability, the Kindle is fundamentally a device built for content consumption. As a tool for reading with limited annotation capabilities, the Kindle lies squarely in Amazon’s walled garden. Over the years, Amazon has given it a limited additions like the ability to look up definitions using a dictionary that is useful but painfully isolated. Sure, there are features like X-Ray for deeper story insights, but those only work if you have bought a book from Amazon’s storefront. For the dedicated reader or an enthusiast like me, if you want to deeply engage with the source material, that consumption-only focus has always been the system’s biggest flaw. You essentially needed a smartphone alongside if you wanted to look up additional context. Adding Gemini to the Kindle is the single biggest upgrade any reader can make to their reading experience. My dream Kindle would be an active, intelligent research tool. One that could instantly answer qu…",

Ballerini, 32, paused mid-performance to deliver a sharp but composed response. “F—k off,” she said from the stage. “Team ‘everyone is happy’ here.” The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, clearly siding with the artist as she continued her set. The moment quickly went viral on social media, with fans applauding Ballerini for setting a boundary and refusing to let the comment go unchecked. Hours later, the Rolling Up the Welcome Mat singer addressed the incident further on her Instagram Stories. “Respectfully, if anyone yells anything disrespectful to anyone during this song again, it will no longer be on the setlist,” she wrote, adding that the song “Penthouse” holds personal meaning and deserves space for reflection — not heckling. “Please let this be a song that matters to people and not a place to insert yourself …",

This potential change prioritizes maximum security over convenience, preventing accidental unlocks if your watch is merely nearby. Users will likely need to toggle off Advanced Protection Mode to regain the ability to unlock their Pixel phone via their Pixel Watch. The Google Pixel Watch features a Watch Unlock function that allows you to use the smartwatch as a key to unlock your Pixel phone. This is very convenient, as it replaces the need for a traditional passcode or biometric identification as long as you’re wearing the watch (and it’s connected to your phone). Although the feature is great, there are instances when you don’t want your watch to unlock your phone. Google could soon update the Watch Unlock functionality to prevent your phone from unlocking with the Pixel Watch when security features like Android Advanced Protection Mode are enabled.

According to anecdotal reports from the usual corners of the internet, one unexpected bonus appears to be improved graphics performance for the Pixel 10. Google hasn’t officially mentioned a new GPU driver that Pixel 10 owners have been waiting for, but that doesn’t mean that minor improvements or optimizations aren’t tucked away inside. To find out, I grabbed my Pixel 10 Pro XL running the November 2025 patch, ran our usual test suite, and then updated to the QPR2 December 2025 update and tested again.",

Most of you get wallpapers directly from the internet, swatting apps like Panels to the wayside. However, there’s a problem with relying on apps and the internet for customization: these wallpapers aren’t entirely yours. With this in mind, I’ve made a point to go a step further with my phone customization and create my own wallpapers to bring a real personal touch to my device.

That balance is slowly changing in the US as prepaid adoption is rising while postpaid growth has stalled or even slipped in some cases. The main driver is customer frustration with steady price escalations, including fee hikes, smaller autopay discounts, and direct plan increases. For example, Verizon recently cut its myPlan autopay discount from ten dollars to five dollars, and all three major carriers have raised their infrastructure fees. T-Mobile also stopped including taxes and fees in its advertised pricing. I have argued before that prepaid is now the better choice for many consumers. The real questions are what caused this shift, whether it could have been avoided, and how worried the big three should be about prepaid competitors.",

Just weeks after we covered ViWoods’ unexpectedly ambitious AiPaper Reader, the world’s first reader running Android 16 , the company is already expanding the lineup. This time, it’s adding a splash of color with the AiPaper Reader C, a variant that trades the crisp monochrome Carta panel for a color E Ink display. It’s a trendy pivot, as more and more e-readers get colorful makeovers throughout the market. The move to color should make the Reader C more appealing to anyone who regularly handles comics, illustrated books, children’s titles, or PDFs with charts and diagrams. Color E Ink still isn’t vibrant in the LCD sense, but it does add context that grayscale can’t always capture. As always, a color E Ink panel also reduces sharpness, meaning text and fine lines won’t look as crisp as they do on the monochrome AiPaper Reader.",

Despite Google denying wrongdoing, that settlement is set to pay out $700 million this spring. If you’re owed a cut, you probably don’t have to do much to get it. As reported today by ZDNET , settlement payments are on track to be distributed soon after a fairness hearing scheduled for April 30 of next year. Owners of Google accounts in all 50 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands who made purchases on the Play Store between 2016 and 2023 are included in the settlement. Payments should be distributed automatically.",

Users report consistent success triggering actions with double-back tap, as compared to the hit-and-miss before. You can enable the feature or change its function under Settings &gt; System &gt; Gestures &gt; Quick Tap to start actions. December 2025 has been an exciting month for Pixel fans. Google not only rolled out the much-loved Android 16 QPR2 release in the stable branch, but it also quashed a ton of bugs with the update. Beyond what Google announced, users also reported that the update quietly restored the screen-off fingerprint unlock feature. Google didn’t announce this either, but as it turns out, the company may have also improved the double-tap back panel gesture. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Update: December 5, 2025 (10:43 AM ET): Netflix has announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Warner Bros Discovery to acquire WBD’s film and television studios, HBO Max, and HBO. This means that shows and movies, including the DC Universe, The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz, and more, will now be under the Netflix umbrella once the transaction is closed. In the announcement, Netflix states that it “expects to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.” The company also says, “By adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.” Netflix did not share how this development will affect its streaming prices.",

At the time, OnePlus stated that it was “refining the thermal curve” and has since issued an update to the handset, claiming it has addressed the problem. So we’ve updated our handset and re-run the tests to find out. Before conducting the stress tests, we re-ran the OnePlus 15 through GeekBench 6 to verify that the phone’s overall performance profile hadn’t changed. The good news is that CPU performance remains just as good, if not marginally better (though a 1.5% to 2% improvement is within the margin of error) than before the update. Flicking on the phone’s performance mode is actually closer to 5% faster in multi-core.",

One of the new social gaming features introduced with the Nintendo Switch 2 is GameChat, which essentially lets you join a group video call where everyone shares their game screen and camera feed. GameChat lets you see and chat with friends even if they’re playing different games, but it requires external hardware to show your face, as the Switch 2 lacks a built-in camera. Nintendo says the Switch 2 works with most USB webcams, but in our early testing, we found that it wasn’t compatible with the Pixel’s USB webcam mode. Fortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

Founder Nicholas Merrill says the goal is to break the link between a person’s phone identity and their personal data.

Nicholas Merrill is best known for fighting an FBI surveillance order for more than a decade.

As Wired reports, Phreeli (pronounced like ‘freely’) runs on T-Mobile’s network, but the real headline is what it refuses to collect. The company doesn’t ask for your name, address, or any other information that could be linked to your phone number. Merrill states that the level of anonymity is legal in every US state, and the ZIP code is provided solely for tax purposes.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR Some Pixel owners say the December update stopped the notification shade from opening normally in One-Handed Mode. Reports span several models, but others say theirs still works, so the issue isn’t universal. Google hasn’t documented any changes to One-Handed Mode; we’ve reached out to the company for comment. A handful of Pixel owners claim that the December Pixel update may have inadvertently broken one of the commonly used gestures. Several online reports claim that the notification shade can no longer be pulled down once One-Handed Mode is active, a feature that was working normally before the latest update. The first report appeared on Google’s Pixel Support page , where a Pixel 9 Pro owner said they were suddenly unable to open the notification panel after triggering One-Handed Mode. Similar complaints then surfaced on Reddit here and here , with users on devices ranging from the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 10 Pro XL reporting that the same gesture no longer works after the update.",
