Anyone who is incorrectly placed in the under-18 category will have to verify their age with a selfie. Since last year, YouTube has been cracking down on non-age-verified accounts. Although the goal is to protect the platform’s youngest viewers, the age-prediction system YouTube deployed has wrongly ensnared countless accounts owned by adults.

A wave of then-emerging artists, including J Balvin, Maluma and Karol G, were not only making significant strides in the local Colombian music scene, but also preparing for their international leap. Notably, Balvin became the It Guy, powering off the momentum he had in 2015, with two songs reaching No. 1 on the Hot Latin Songs chart: “Ay Vamos” and “Ginza.” The latter bumped Nicky Jam and Enrique Iglesias’ “El Perdon” from their No. 1 throne after a marathon 30-week rule. “I thought, why not go back to reggaetón? Because when all is said and done, it’s part of our culture as Latins,” the Colombian artist said in a 2016 interview with Billboard . “And finally, the song was so hooky, it worked. Let’s be honest, &#8216;Ginza&#8217; doesn’t really have lyrics to speak of. It’s a party track — a party for reggaetoneros to come out of the closet. We made reggaetón cool again.” Off of its 2015 success, the Japanese-inspired song kicked off 2016 at No. 1, where it spent 11 more weeks, until a new banger arrived: Nicky Jam’s “Hasta El Amanecer,” which topped Hot Latin Songs for 18 n…",

You’ve got shy but brainy new girl Gabriella (Hudgens) and golden boy jock Troy (Efron) who end up together despite their differences. Then there’s Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), the popular diva who tries to rip them apart; Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), Sharpay’s brother and partner-in-crime; and Chad (Corbin Bleu) and Taylor (Monique Coleman), the best friends of the two leads — who give pretty bad advice, but that’s what part of drives the plot forward. What made this film — and the two sequels that came after — unique wasn’t how the characters broke out of their archetypes by the end of the story (which they do), but rather the music that came with it. The first film’s soundtrack topped the Billboard 200, and a handful of its songs hit the top 40 of the Hot 100.

    "body": "TL;DR The upcoming iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max will feature smaller Dynamic Island cutouts that will still be centered, a new leak claims. A previous leak implied the phones would shift the cutout to the left corner of the display. The phones are likely to be released this September. Yesterday, we saw a leak that said Apple’s next flagship phone, the iPhone 18 Pro, might tuck its Face ID sensor under the display, in the process shrinking the now-trademark Dynamic Island cluster and shifting it to the left. Today, another leak corroborates part of that story while contradicting another. Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels. Contrary to yesterday’s leak, though, this one claims that the visible Dynamic Island cutout will stay in the middle of the display.",

However, this feature apparently keeps getting added and removed between stable updates. Google also added a portrait lock toggle in beta releases, but the setting hasn’t made its way to the stable release yet, causing further confusion. Until Google makes up its mind, users can stop the unintentional rotation by disabling system-wide auto-rotate. Back in September 2025, users began getting annoyed when their phone calls switched to landscape orientation while using the Google Phone app. As it turns out, the Google Phone app had just started supporting landscape UI for calls , and users with auto-rotate enabled on their phones were seeing the intended behavior but mistakenly thought it was a bug. Users are complaining once again that the Phone app is turning to landscape, and, as before, it might still be intended behavior. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "summary": "The store employee may have more incentives for you to sign up than you do.",
    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile store employees reportedly say credit card signups are now tracked as part of performance metrics. Customers may be flagged internally, prompting reps to offer the card proactively via SMS during a visit. You’re still under no obligation to apply, but don’t be surprised if the card comes up quickly and unprompted. If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Many Pixel owners have complained about Microsoft Office apps not functioning properly on their devices. The issue particularly affects those running Android 16 QPR3 beta. While Google has acknowledged the issue and claimed to fix it with the latest beta last week, the issue still persists. When Google pushed out the Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update for Pixel 6 and newer devices last week, it shared a long list of fixes that the update brought. The changelog also mentioned that the issue of Microsoft apps randomly crashing on previous versions was also fixed. Despite this, however, several users have reported that the issues still persist. That could be frustrating, especially as Google endorses Android QPR beta updates — unlike the pre-release betas — fit for regular use. A large number of reports on the Android beta subreddit, as well as Google’s Issue Tracker, still echo that the bug hasn’t been fixed even after Google claims it has been. The degree to which it affects different people varies, though. For some, only certain Microsoft apps, such as Teams, crash abruptly, while for some others, it’s a larger mix of apps.

Back then, its Galaxy A54 5G challenged Google’s Pixel 7a as its closest rival, combining a triple-camera system and a robust 5,000mAh battery to win users away from the simplicity of Pixel UI and the reliability of Google’s image processing. By all accounts, it was a good $500 phone, offering more than enough bang for your buck. Then, it disappeared. Well, Samsung decided not to offer the Galaxy A55 5G in the States, anyway, making its sub-flagship Fan Edition the go-to option instead. And over the course of that break, the affordable Android market has changed entirely. Rivals like OnePlus and Motorola have stepped up their game, and Google’s Pixel A series is better than ever.",

You can ask about existing events and create new ones on your secondary calendars. This is great for anyone with work, school, or family calendars.

It’s been nearly two years since Google released the Gemini app for Android and enabled users to switch from Assistant to Gemini despite a bunch of limitations and missing features. One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears. Now, two years later, Google has finally fixed this stupid oversight and added back support for multiple calendars to Gemini, so any employee, family member, or student can access their full schedule again — with a few caveats, though.",

Its full-color, 60Hz screen paired with Android 14 offer more flexibility than many e-readers. The tablet is available now in Europe for around €369, with no US release confirmed. Most Android tablets focus on brighter screens and higher specs. The HANNspree Lumo takes a different approach, using a reflective LCD display designed to mimic the look of paper while still running full Android. It lands somewhere between a tablet and an e-reader, offering users a more comfortable everyday tablet experience. Instead of a traditional LCD or OLED panel, the Lumo features a 7.8-inch reflective LCD display that relies primarily on ambient light. The result is a matte, low-glare screen that’s easier on the eyes, especially compared to the backlit panels most tablets feature. HANNspree describes the Lumo as a “Dynamic Paper Tablet,” positioning it as a middle ground between traditional tablets and dedicated e-readers. Physically, the tablet is slim and lightweight, measuring about 6.6mm thick and weighing roughly 250g.",

Realme says the battery uses advanced safety and longevity tech to slow wear and stay stable over time. For quite some time now, 5,000mAh has been the standard for smartphone batteries, often leaving users to carry battery banks or use a low-power mode. Now, realme is changing things by launching a smartphone with a huge 10,001 mAh battery, rather than just showing off a concept or a lab prototype. The main feature here is realme’s Titan battery, a 10,001mAh cell that the company says can last a week. The number stands out, but what’s more impressive is how fast realme turned the idea into a real product. After showing a 10,000mAh concept phone last year, the company has now started mass-producing the 10,001mAh battery.",

In an Instagram post from its official account, TrimUI describes the Brick Pro as “the ultimate evolution of the vertical handheld.” The company says it has kept the ultra-portable DNA intact, but added a larger 4-inch display and dual analog sticks, arranged below the D-pad and face buttons. TrimUI also says the new layout has been reworked with modern gaming in mind, while still leaning into retro nostalgia.",

After relaunching the Pocket 6 with two different control layouts, early shipments of the Android handheld are now being staggered thanks to a production slowdown tied to its OLED screen. In a Discord update to customers, the company said it will only be able to ship around 100 black Pocket 6 units next Monday, starting with the stick-on-top version. Retroid says the holdup comes down to OLED screen calibration, which has limited how many units it can get out the door during early production.",

The change builds on last year’s move to give every secondary calendar a dedicated owner. The rollout starts today for personal accounts and on January 27 for Workspace users. It’s pretty easy to create a secondary calendar in Google Calendar and then completely forget about it, but Google is stepping in to tidy things up. The company is rolling out a change that ensures any secondary calendars you own will always appear in your calendar list in Settings, making them easier to find and manage. Detailed in a Google Workspace Update , this move builds on a change Google introduced late last year, when it moved secondary calendars to a dedicated ownership model. Under that system, every secondary calendar has a single owner who’s responsible for its settings, permissions, and lifecycle. The new update closes a practical gap in that setup by ensuring ownership is visible.",

That was a fantastic start, but there was still a long way to go in terms of expanding compatibility. Earlier this month we saw Google’s efforts begin to bring the upgrade to Pixel 9 phones in Android Canary , and that’s work the company has continued with its more recent Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 release.

The Pocket S Mini has a retro-friendly 4:3 display, although the exact specifications and size have yet to be announced. On stream, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang held the device next to a standard smartphone, and it roughly matched in size. The screen itself is around the same size as the budget Pocket AIR Mini’s 4.2-inch LCD display, although this handheld is much, much more powerful.",

Meanwhile, Samsung appears to be releasing only minor upgrades for its upcoming Galaxy S26 series, as rivals significantly innovate — raising concerns about its competitiveness. Samsung is gearing up to launch a barely upgraded Galaxy S26 series in the coming weeks, hoping to take on the iPhone 17 series with renewed vigor. While Samsung mostly stagnates even on its Plus and Ultra flagships and might do so for yet another generation, Apple is preparing for another big change with the iPhone 18 Pro series and is finally entering the foldable market with the iPhone Fold , likely in September. Now, specs for all these upcoming iPhones have leaked again, and it’s not looking great for Samsung unless it pulls up its socks. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It could finally bring the camera on par with other flagships, especially by including a 200MP primary sensor. However, it’s unclear whether this is for the OnePlus 16 or any other phone. OnePlus’ parent company, OPPO, has recently made significant strides with its flagship Find X series cameras, from using a large 200MP telephoto sensor to supporting external zoom lenses on the phone . Unfortunately, OnePlus has been deprived of these features, with the camera especially sidelined to improve performance in the latest OnePlus 15 and 15R phones. This, naturally, has drawn much criticism, which OnePlus now appears to be preparing to tackle with the next flagship — most likely, the OnePlus 16. While the launch of that supposed phone is still several months away, we’re already seeing early leaks, starting with speculation about the camera. Last month, leaker Digital Chat Station predicted that OnePlus’ next flagship would feature an upgraded 200MP primary camera. Now, another leaker, Yogesh Brar , is highlighting details about the other sensors in the phone’s camera setup…",

Learning how to harden your NAS can be annoying, but it pays off in peace of mind. You see, a modern NAS is not just a hard drive with a network cable; it is a fully functional server. Once you start enabling features that make a NAS useful, like remote streaming or file sharing, you are effectively opening it up to wide open internet and that means its time for you to start acting as your own IT department.

Eventually, Google backed down and offered to give advanced users an option for manual installs from unknown sources. Ahead of that rolling out, we’re seeing Google Play begin to prepare for this system’s arrival. Update: January 18, 2026 (11:18 PM ET): After publication, we heard from Marc Prud’hommeaux, the founder of the App Fair Project and an F-Droid board member, who pointed out that the warning strings we referenced are not entirely new to Android. Versions of this language have existed in Android’s system-level Package Installer since at least July 2025. This suggests that Google has been preparing the developer verification flow mentioned below for quite some time. That said, our reporting focused on the fact that this language has now appeared inside the Google Play app itself, which is a new development. The move from system-level code to Google Play could signal that the company is actively preparing to surface this flow to users. Still, Google has yet to clearly explain how its promised “advanced” sideloading path will work in practice. Until the c…",

It wasn’t just the premium choice, it was the safe choice, and frankly, the only choice that made sense if you needed a solid balance of hardware and software. But over the last month, I’ve done something that would have seemed unthinkable to me a year ago. I left my iPad at home and have been carrying around the OnePlus Pad Go 2 instead. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 isn't just cheaper, it might actually be better for what I do. At roughly $400, this really should not be a fair fight. My iPad setup cost nearly three times as much once you factor in the keyboard and Apple Pencil. Yet, for my specific workflow, which revolves heavily around on-the-go learning, research, and capturing spontaneous ideas, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is not just a cheaper alternative — it honestly might just be the better tool.

Although this is still a patent, and patents have a tendency to remain theoretical hogwash, there’s actually a reason why this particular one might end up in an actual product like the Pixel 12: the European Union’s battery regulation .
