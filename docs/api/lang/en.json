Although Nova Launcher’s death knell has already sounded, my recent thoughts have turned to Sesame Shortcuts’ dim future.

It helps me effectively manage my low self-control to use the phone, while allowing me to stay on top of notifications and important calls. If you, like me, willingly stick with Android and want to access apps that sync with your phone directly on your wrist, then Wear OS is your best option. Therefore, the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Pixel Watch 4 are two of the best smartwatches with Wear OS you can buy. The Galaxy Watch 8 and the Pixel Watch 4 are both from distinct lots that may not typically appeal to the same kind of users. If you already own a Samsung phone, and don’t mind sticking to the comparatively less restrictive ecosystem (than Apple’s) , the Galaxy Watch is the way to go. If you cherish the best of Google and want the latest features — which will eventually trickle down to all devices — from Wear OS, the Pixel Watch 4 may be the right pick for you.",

In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps.

    "body": "TL;DR Google Maps may be considering a change to its interface for adding stops to a route. Instead of seeing options on the map, you could choose them from a list, and also filter those results. The new filters also appear to be in the works for Maps on Android Auto. Plans change, but when they do, Google Maps is ready to roll with the punches. Even if we’re already in the middle of a journey, Maps makes it easy to search for new destinations along our route, and add them as new stops in just a couple taps. While that works great, Google has never been one to leave well enough alone, and we’ve spotted the company’s developers working on what looks like a new approach to how we add destinations like that.

Trying out beta software means accepting some level of risk, but how much do you really expect to break when running an Android beta? Maybe Google Wallet stops working? Fingerprint sensor shuts down? A few app crashes, sure, but most of the time Google still manages to give us a largely functional piece of software.

Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August.

Update: Oct 16, 2025 (09:15 AM ET): We were able to reverse engineer the latest beta build to get a glimpse of how DMs in ChatGPT could work. While it’s not functional at the moment, we can see that ChatGPT lets you share individual responses as well as the entire chat with others. We also see the option to block other users.

The phone also features special color tuning by camera brand Ricoh and is realme’s first phone with a special partnership. Innovation is dead, one could easily argue in the context of phone designs. In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design. At the same time, certain outliers, like Nothing, challenge that notion by experimenting with unusual camera designs , secondary displays , and unusually tiny screens . Now, another leading Android manufacturer is experimenting with a subtle change that can radically alter the phone’s look by altering how the camera appears. OnePlus’ sister brand, realme, has just begun teasing its upcoming flagship with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 .

I highly rate the Find X8 Pro — my current daily driver — in no small part for its stunning pictures. But OPPO plans to take things up a gear this year with a new 200-megapixel telephoto camera, co-developed with Hasselblad once again. The company also has a Hasselblad telephoto extender lens that takes the 200MP camera’s 3.3x zoom / 70mm focal length and blasts it up to a longer-range 9.6x zoom with an equivalent 230mm focal length. Paired with crops and upscaling from that huge 200MP camera, it can take photos all the way out to 40x (920mm).",

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.
