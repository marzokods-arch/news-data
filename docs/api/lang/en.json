    "body": "Bobby Hart , a key part of the the Monkees ’ multimedia empire who teamed with Tommy Boyce on such hits as “Last Train to Clarksville” and “I’m Not Your Steppin’ Stone,” has died. He was 86. Hart died at his home in Los Angeles, according to his friend and co-author Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year. Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful team in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, the made-for-television group promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees’ theme song, with its opening shot, “Here we come, walkin’ down the street,” and its enduring chant, “Hey, hey, we’re the Monkees,” and their first No. 1 hit, “Last Train to Clarksville.” The Monkees’ eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players. “I always credit them not only with writing many of our biggest hits, but, as producers, being instrumental in creating the unique Monkee sound we all know and love,” the Monkees’ Micky Dolenz wrote in a foreword to Hart’s memoir, Psychedelic Bubblegum , published in 2015.

And during the two-time Grammy winner’s 2 ½-hour set, Brown proved once more what a consummate artist/performer he’s become as he celebrates 20 years in music with his legion of fans. From the moment Brown rose up onstage to a standing ovation — buttressed by resounding cheers and shout-outs — to when he triumphantly exited alongside his team of masterful dancers, he kept the audience engaged the entire time. As noted by Billboard and in other media coverage since the tour’s U.S. leg kicked off on July 30 in Miami, Brown’s show is comprised of four acts complemented by various video segments, album cover images and photo flashbacks: Rise, Fall (during which Brown is seen on video addressing his legal issues over the years), Fantasy and Legacy. The most moving montage came towards the show’s end, in which Brown is seen interacting with his three children. During each of the acts, an indefatigable Brown performs key songs associated with those time periods in his career. Drawing from …",

    "body": "The Sun blew out a coronal mass ejection along with part of a solar filament over a three-hour period on Feb. 24, 2015. Because this occurred way over near the edge of the Sun, it was unlikely to have any effect on Earth. NASA The NASA-ESA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft captured this extreme ultraviolet wavelength image of the Sun on Feb. 24, 2015, during a three-hour period in which our closest star blew out a coronal mass ejection along with part of a solar filament. While some of the strands fell back into the Sun, a substantial part raced into space in a bright cloud of particles. Launched in December 1995, the joint NASA-ESA SOHO mission, was designed to study the Sun inside out. Though its mission was scheduled to run until only 1998, it has continued collecting data, adding to scientists&#8217; understanding of our closest star, and making many new discoveries , including more than 5,000 comets. NASA continues to study the Sun with various spacecraft. Soon, there will be three new ways to study the Sun’s influence across the solar system with the launch of a trio of NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spacecraft. Expected to…",
