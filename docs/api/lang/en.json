Like the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air, the main draw to the Moto X70 Air will be its ultra-thin design. Currently, we expect the X70 Air to be released exclusively in China, although a global launch may occur at a later date. Thin smartphones are all the rage this year. After Samsung kickstarted the trend earlier this year, and Apple just brought it back into the spotlight, it appears that Motorola is the next company to throw its hat into the thin phone ring. The official Motorola account on Weibo recently published a teaser image for the Moto X70 Air, and it takes just one look to see that this is a phone designed to compete with the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air . Not only does the Moto X70 Air name give it away, but the image of the phone shows someone holding a handset that looks every bit as thin as Samsung and Apple’s recent launches.",

We liked the headset quite a bit, but at an MSRP of $299, it’s pretty unequivocally a luxury item. Today, Nothing’s budget sub-brand, CMF, has launched its own pair of over-ears — and they’re predictably a lot cheaper while still coming packed with features. The CMF Headphone Pro , initially teased earlier this month , is now listed on Nothing’s web store. We haven’t gone ears-on with the new cans yet, but their spec sheet looks pretty stacked. The headphones are packing 40mm drivers, ANC, battery life that’ll apparently last for up to 100 hours of playback, and tactile physical controls, all wrapped up in CMF’s signature hip and colorful look.",

NASA At the virtual 2025 ISS Research and Development Conference (ISSDRC), Joe A. Adam of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, presented the topic titled “ Surface Science in Microgravity – Fluid Geometry in the Ring-Sheared Drop ,” presented to a broad audience from academia and the scientific community during the Physical Sciences and Materials Development session. Dr. Adam provided a comprehensive overview of the Ring Sheared Drop (RSD) hardware, experiment campaigns and the evolving role of RSD in advancing biophysical science, particularly in the characterization of proteins. Leveraging the absence of gravity aboard the ISS, the RSD enables researchers to isolate shear-induced aggregation processes relevant to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, offering insight into mechanisms that are difficult to observe with ground-based experiments.

Listeners will have the option for random playback, irrespective of what was played before. They’ll also be able to reduce repeats, by taking recently played tracks out of the running. People have a problem with randomness. We don’t understand it, we have trouble recognizing it, and we often don’t even use the right words to describe it (no, your roommate’s friend’s dog walker is not a “random” addition to your party — they are there expressly because of those existing relationships). This is as true as ever when we’re talking about shuffling a media playlist. While a capital-r random order could include every song alphabetically, the same song over and over again, or not even change the playback order at all, when we say “random” what we tend to actually mean is “different and new.” And now it looks like Spotify is working on some new tools intended to help give listeners just that.

NASA astronaut Chris Williams participates in a spacewalk safety system training in the virtual reality lab at NASA&#8217;s Johnson Space Center. NASA/Riley McClenaghan The training astronaut candidates complete is comprehensive and rigorous. They learn about NASA’s history and vision, and how astronauts advance the agency’s mission. They take classes on space health – gaining an understanding of radiation exposure, microgravity’s effects on the human body, space food and nutrition, and how to use the exercise equipment aboard the International Space Station. They also study first aid and practice providing medical care for crewmates.

This past summer was one just full of change, and that was especially true for Google’s Android apps. With the embrace of Material 3 Expressive, apps tried on a whole new look, introducing colorful, high-contrast interfaces. Back in May, we first spotted Google trying out another new look, as it updated its multi-color G logo with a fresh new rainbow gradient appearance. It didn’t take long before we started seeing the spread of this new icon, popping up attached to Gemini in early July. It’s been a few months since then, but apparently that new logo’s spread is just getting started, as Google announces plans to make it the official look of the brand, everywhere.

In addition to the Material You theming options, Google is evaluating the option for a separate color palette in Chrome. These features are currently being tested alongside the option to apply an image as a background. Ever since the rollout of Google’s Material You theme a few years ago, Chrome has been among the apps that seamlessly adapt to the system-wide color palette. However, with upcoming versions, Google may enable the option to apply a distinct color theme to Chrome on Android, separate from the device’s color scheme. This feature is being tested in Chrome Canary, the alpha branch of Chrome, where new features are released before they arrive on the beta or stable versions. Reddit user Leopeva64-2 demonstrated that the option to set a separate theme for Chrome appears in the Appearance section of Chrome Canary. Leopeva64 also posted the demo video on X , and the following screenshots were sourced from it.",

The company has shared images of a new Sand Dune colorway alongside details about the phone’s build. The design reveal includes an image of the phone’s display with a date, which could very well be when the company plans to officially launch the phone. The OnePlus 15 is no longer a mystery. Last week, the company showed off the device at the Snapdragon Summit in China, which was followed by an early review of the phone by YouTuber Geekerwan. Now, OnePlus is showing off its upcoming flagship from all angles in a fresh set of images released on Chinese social media platform Weibo . The teasers not only give us a glimpse at a brand new colorway for the OnePlus 15, but also strongly hint at the phone’s launch date.",

There’s a permanent new “Ask Home” text box at the top to talk to your smart home via Gemini, ask about security camera activity and device statuses, execute actions, or even demand help when building automations. All of this sounds great, and I can’t wait to test it out, but I can’t help but feel like Google is still missing out on more important and overdue updates to the Home app. Talking to Gemini is cool , but it doesn’t check all the boxes of what I expect from my smart home app. Instead, I wish Google would work on these six features.",

As a purely scientific tool, it’s a great way to sweep through troves of documents, research reports, news, and distill trends.

The finance sector, particularly high-frequency trading, has been using AI and machine learning for a while now. Custom AI solutions are also used for predictive analytics and portfolio automation. However, those tools depend on highly specialized in-house AI tools. What I’ve been wondering is — can a general-purpose AI like Google Gemini be optimised to perform similar functions? I was curious to know if an AI model could make sense of my investments, identify risks, and maybe even suggest strategies that were worth testing. A few months ago, I decided to run a small experiment. Instead of blindly following every piece of advice from my portfolio advisor, I wanted to see what would happen if I brought Google’s Gemini AI into the mix. My idea was pretty straightforward.

I’m not exactly young myself as a millennial, but I’ve grown up in the digital age, which means I’ve picked up new tricks as they’ve come on the scene. Writing about them for a living helps quite a lot, too. But for my parents, these little Android features look like magic at times, and some of them can actually be game-changers.

Messages may automatically suggest an @mention when you start typing someone’s name. Being able to get someone’s attention by sending them an @username just feels incredibly natural to so many of us after years and years of these kind of interactions across social media. At this point, we’re honestly just surprised to find cases where it doesn’t work, and while the list of supported platforms includes Google stuff like Chats, so far that hasn’t extended to Messages. Earlier this year, we brought you an early preview of how @mentions in Messages were coming together, and now we’ve got some progress to share.

While tools exist to connect your Android phone to a Windows PC , these solutions often fall short of Apple’s integrations. This gap exists because Android and Windows are developed by different companies with competing interests, which complicates the creation of native, deeply integrated features. For example, Apple’s Handoff feature lets you seamlessly start a task on one device and pick it up on another. Google doesn’t currently offer a direct equivalent for Android, but mounting evidence suggests one is in the works. This new feature appears to be part of Google’s efforts to bring Android to PCs , which would enable the company to build more powerful cross-device experiences.",

I’d go so far as to say that we’re in a golden age of small Android phones — or small phones in general. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 has settled at 6.2 inches, the iPhone 17 is a slightly larger 6.3, and even Google has a Pro-level Pixel with just a 6.3-inch display. And you know what? They’re all really good.

Some advertise heavily, but many remain obscure. Are these lesser-known carriers worth your attention, or is the risk too high? It really depends on what you want and how much risk you’re willing to take. First, it’s important to understand that there’s no clear line on what qualifies as a lesser-known carrier, as it comes down more to your individual knowledge about the industry. Thanks to increased advertising, you’ve likely at least heard of Boost Mobile, Mint Mobile, Cricket Wireless, Metro by T-Mobile, and maybe even a few other options like Tello or Total.

New paid options are meant to address the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office consent or pay guidance that says online services must allow users to pay a fee in order to “avoid their personal information being used for personalised advertising” — exactly what Meta is doing here. For now, the option is exclusive to the UK. UK-based users are getting options to pay £2.99 (~$4) a month to opt out of ads on the web, or £3.99 (~$5) a month to remove ads from the Facebook and Instagram mobile apps. But of course, the traditional social media business model is built on ad revenue, and ads on Instagram and Facebook are pervasive in all markets.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is working to improve the performance of graphical Linux apps on Android, which currently run slowly using inefficient CPU-based rendering. This will be achieved by implementing gfxstream, a technology that forwards graphics API calls to the host’s GPU for near-native performance. Evidence for this was found in a hidden “Graphics Acceleration” setting in the Terminal app that enables a new “GPU-accelerated renderer.” Earlier this year, Google introduced the Linux Terminal app , giving developers and power users the ability to run full-fledged Linux applications on their Android devices. While it was initially limited to command-line apps, Google recently added support for running Linux apps with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), a significant step forward for the feature. However, there’s a major catch with the current implementation. All graphics rendering is handled by the CPU instead of the GPU, which is not only incredibly slow but also very taxing on a device’s battery and thermals. This is only a temporary problem, though, as Google is already working on a new feature that will make these apps run significantly better.",

YouTube TV’s multiview feature is one of my favorite things about the streaming service, especially right now during football season when I can have four games playing simultaneously on any given Sunday. Unfortunately, multiview hasn’t been working very well for a lot of YouTube TV subscribers. For the last couple of weeks, the r/YouTubeTV subreddit has been flooded with user complaints about multiview being hampered by extremely low picture quality, including comments about multiview streams appearing blocky and “sometimes unviewable.”",

For the small fraction of our readers who dislike the new design, the primary complaint is readability. Material 3 Expressive makes copious use of background blur effects, which, while visually appealing, comes at the cost of text visibility. Although this may not affect most people, the reduced contrast poses an accessibility challenge for some users.

Both of these toggles would automatically decide when your phone switches from mobile data to Wi-Fi.

Many Android phones today offer an option to seamlessly switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi as needed. This is particularly useful if you’ve got a poor Wi-Fi connection, allowing you to automatically switch to mobile data for a better experience. However, it looks like Samsung could offer two ways to customize this switch-over experience. SammyGuru reports that One UI 8.5 has two AI-related toggles that govern when you switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data. The first toggle is called Intelligent Link Assessment , and switches your phone from Wi-Fi to mobile data based on “Wi-Fi link data.” I’m guessing this means the phone will look at your Wi-Fi connection’s speed, latency, and other factors before deciding to switch.

I like the bold colors, the seamlessness of the unibody shell, and I’ll admit the camera plateau is growing on me. There’s just one problem: Scratchgate . The new iPhone 17 series is picking up scratches like no other, forcing me to consider a break from my no-case lifestyle to keep my phone presentable.",
