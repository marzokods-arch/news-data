View this post on Instagram Among the first to publicly pay tribute was Brent Smith of Shinedown, who shared a video message recalling how 3 Doors Down helped his band early in their career. “You guys were the first band that ever took us out on the road,” Smith said, referencing Shinedown’s opening slot for 3 Doors Down in 2003. “Brad was always kind, always encouraging, and always real.” He captioned the post: &#8220;Thank you for the music.

Metals are the materials most commonly used in welding, but it&#8217;s also possible to weld thermoplastics or wood. Welders use their hands, skills, and problem-solving abilities to create something new. At NASA, welders use different types of welding processes to assemble spacecraft and rocket components. Welders also put their expertise to work on equipment and facilities that make space exploration possible, such as launch pads, fuel tanks, propellant lines, and buildings where rockets are assembled. What are the different types of welding? Welding can be done in many different ways. Here are some of the types of welding used at NASA: Arc Welding: Uses electricity to melt metals and fuse them together. There are many types of arc welding, including TIG and MIG welding, described below. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding: Uses a protective gas like argon or helium to keep the metal from reacting with air. TIG welding doesn’t leave behind splatter or residue, giving a clean, precise weld. Metal Inert Gas (MIG) Welding: Whi…",

Foley (UC Santa Cruz), Dark Energy Survey/DOE/FNAL/DECam/CTIO/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA; Acknowledgment: Mehmet Yüksek This new Hubble image, released on Jan. 30, 2026, is the sharpest taken of NGC 7722, a lenticular galaxy located about 187 million light-years away in the constellation&nbsp;Pegasus. A lenticular, meaning “lens-shaped,” galaxy is a type whose classification sits between more familiar&nbsp;spiral galaxies&nbsp;and&nbsp;elliptical galaxies. It is also less common than spirals and ellipticals — partly because these galaxies have a somewhat ambiguous appearance, making it hard to determine if it is a spiral, an elliptical, or something in between.

With events spread across more than 22,000 square kilometers (8,500 square miles) and eight cities or towns in northern Italy, these are the most geographically dispersed Games in Olympic history.
