Well, today is November 25, and yeah, you can probably see where I'm going with this. The Battlefield 6 free trial is live! One thing interesting (and, I think, new) about the Battlefield 6 free trial is that you don't access it through Battlefield 6, as you might expect; if you hop around to the BF6 Steam page , you'll see there's no sort of \"try me free!\" option available. Instead, you get to it through Battlefield Redsec , the battle royale mode, which is always free to play. But during the trial period, you'll also have access to three playlists, including a \"casual multiplayer experience,\" across three maps: Siege of Cairo, Eastwood, and Blackwell Fields.\" In a nice nod to newcomers, EA also provided a handy breakdown of each game mode available in the trial, as well as some tips on how to play them effectively . So if you don't know what Escalation is, for instance, or how to play it in a way that will actually be useful to your team, this is a way to get a sense of the basics without ge…",

It might be just what you need, too—especially now that Reforged has its own private multiplayer servers, the headline feature of its recent 2.0 update . Even more ambitiously than the popular Seamless Co-op mod (which is also fully supported here), Reforged bypasses the original game's anti-cheat systems while retaining bloodstains, phantoms, summons and invasions. Helpful, as there are more than 1,200 collectible stat-boosting rune fragments hidden throughout the entire game like Crackdown's irresistible agility orbs, many of which you'd never find without other kindly players placing glowing, tongue-in-cheek hints. This mod understands that even playing solo, Elden Ring is a shared experience. It just wouldn't be the same without people declaring that every single turtle is actually a dog.

At least not yet. Eleventh Hour Games broke its silence on whether you'll have to pay for Last Epoch's upcoming Orobyss expansion after spending years—as an indie developer—promising players everything would be free. The answer is no: Last Epoch's expansion will be free to anyone who already owns the base game, and it will be packed in for anyone who buys the game after it's out. Last month, EHG founder Judd Cobler said the studio would \"maybe\" have to charge something for the expansion, as the game's first three seasons haven't been profitable. But now it looks like EHG will hold to the promise it made when it ran a Kickstarter for the game in 2018. There's a small catch here though: Alongside the expansion a new \"Paradox class\" will be released and it will have a price that won't be revealed until later. In the announcement post on Reddit, Cobler describes it as a \"fully alternate playable class built on systems that work differently from anything else in the game.\" T…",

Today, attention turned to next week's Renegades launch, in the form of a live stream breaking down what to expect from the Star Wars-themed expansion. Although I wrote previously that I had no interest in cosplaying as Darth Vader , I have warmed up to the idea of injecting some Star Wars flavour in the form of blaster weapons, some quasi-Jedi on Sith beef, and of course an ersatz lightsaber. Still, there are plenty in what remains of the community with doubts about the wisdom of smushing two sci-fi franchises together. I found it reassuring to hear the game's narrative director Alison Lührs admit that the first thing the Bungie team asked when they sat down with LucasFilm in San Francisco was: 'What's the bad version of this?'\" I guess it made sense to get the image of Jar Jar Binks hurling a Nova Bomb out of the way early.

Players seemed to enjoy the combination of cozy shop simulator and dungeon crawling roguelite, inspired by the Rogue Legacies and Stardew Valleys of the time. Some grumbled about a lack of depth and incentive to keep returning to the dungeon again and again, and seven years later developer Digital Sun is ready to show us what it’s learned from those criticisms. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is now available in early access on Steam. I spent several hours with it over the past week, and it already feels like a more focused and refined version of the original. The premise remains unchanged: you play as Will, a shopkeep-slash-dungeoneer who is looking to turn his spoils into cold hard cash. The core loop involves diving into randomized dungeons, fighting the monsters there, filling your backpack with loot, selling it for a tidy profit, and doing it all again. Inventory management itself is a puzzle, as items interact with each other in your backpack, forcing you to think carefully about how you use the limited space. In essence, it’s three games in one, each section complete with its own rules. Whil…",

Naomi Alderman is a published author of science fiction novels. And for years she's also been the lead writer for a gamified fitness app called Zombies, Run! It encourages players to get on the move by listening to episodic post-apocalyptic stories, interval training while actively 'running from zombies,' and supplies rewards from workout sessions to upgrade their survival base. Alderman co-created the app and wrote its years' worth of voice-acted, episodic stories that have amassed over 10 million users since 2012. My best friend has been evangelizing this game to me (unsuccessfully only because I hate running) on the grounds of its excellent story for all 13 of those years, even when its future was looking bleak more recently.

It's worth noting that none of these distressed investments are directly related to gaming. Troubled projects include Saudi Arabia's ambitious (some may say preposterous) city construction project Neom , with its plans for a 105 mile, glass-walled city called \"The Line\" being massively scaled back .

That Skyrim mod was down to game developer and modder Trainwiz (and friends), who notes in his Bluesky bio that \"Mattel is out to kill me.\" This is because toy giant Mattel owns the rights to the Thomas the Tank Engine characters, and doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humour about Thomas mods. Thus, we arrive at a new frontier for Thomas-based heroics. Trainwiz has popped up with a new mod for Morrowind that \"replaces cliff racers with Thomas the Tank Engine.\" Cliff racers are flying creatures that appear all around the Vvardenfell region of Morrowind, and occasionally swarm the player.

Bits like whipping a fish out of the water so you can quick-scope it in midair with a bolt-action rifle for bonus XP. The description on the How to Fish Steam listing doesn't do it justice: \"You and your friends are out drinking and boating. You crash into a small island where you have to fish using everything from fishing rods to assault rifles,\" it explains. \"Sell your catch, earn money, buy better fishing gear, and defeat boss fishes to unlock new islands and finally make it back home.\" We've been living in a post- Ridiculous Fishing world of absurdist angling for years. But what catches my eye about How to Fish is the speed of its 0-100 acceleration from traditional fishing to physics-based guntoting dipshittery.

(Image credit: Quantic Dream) There are six spellcasters for you to try out: Two Duelists ( the Swamp Witch and the Astral Monk), two Conquerers (the Iron Sorcerer and Fire Elementalist), and two Enchanters (the Mystic Scribe and Stone Shaman). Each one will have a variety of decks, expendable summons, and abilities. Everyone also has an ultimate that builds up throughout the match and access to summoning a titan, a huge beast the size of a skyscraper that can destroy almost anything in its path. \"We built Spellcasters Chronicles as a game that thrives on adaptation, creativity, and team synergy, and that only truly …",

Shortly after tanking Fallout 4's \"very positive\" review average on Steam, Bethesda said it was investigating reports of new bugs, performance issues, and crashes introduced with the Creations Menu Update that went out alongside the Anniversary Edition . The studio issued a hotfix on November 17 for its biggest troublemaker, Fallout 4's Creations Menu, and shared plans for more on November 24, followed by another update sometime in December. Bethesda made good on some performance fixes last Friday, on November 21, when it published a follow up Steam blog with patch notes to address stability and crash issues.

Researchers at security services provider Huntress have detailed the novel new method in a blog post , and it's quite the feat of social engineering.

Every character can also sprint along the ground or fly in the sky for an unlimited amount of time, making it easy to get a good grasp of the battlefield.

It's back in GOG Preservation Program form. In other words, GOG's done some work on this one. \"The new GOG release of Cold Fear isn’t just a reappearance on a storefront—it’s a quality re-release with extensive under-the-hood work,\" reads the blurb. That means Windows 10/11 support, support for 4K and high refresh rates, modern controller support, and patches for common crashes and glitches—just generally the gubbins you need to launch a game with confidence on a PC in 2025. You can find the full changelog on GOG . Also, it's not alone. Alongside the Cold Fear re-release, GOG's adding Ubisoft's 2012 action-adventure game I Am Alive to its storefront and lineup of preserved titles. That game has gotten a spit-polish too, with support for online achievements, cloud saves, high refresh rates, modern controllers, and various bugfixes and such. As a 2005 game, our review of Cold Fear is lost to the mists of time (that's what we call the closet filled with the last 30-plus years of magazines), but our review of I Am Alive is…",

I came into it with this expectation that it was going to be a simple, easy, plug-and-play, get-it-tested-and-done article. A lengthy piece about a $4,000 laptop, brimming with hardware, glowing with accolades and triumphs on its legendary performance and impressive build quality. Yet on my first bout with the Gen 10, it left me sorely disappointed, more so because of my own hubris and oversight than because of the laptop itself. The thing is, I didn't know it then, I didn't understand what it was capable of, and after multiple weeks of testing, re-testing, and really getting under the skin of the Legion 9i, I am now a convert. Hands-down, it is, without a doubt, one of the best gaming laptops I've ever had the privilege of playing with. Albeit with a few minor caveats to that glowing recommendation. So, let's start with the specs first, because it's a whole cornucopia of madness depending on which side of that big Atlantic fish-pond you live on.

Look at those things. \"Ready up with this controller-meets-clog design that reimagines the iconic Xbox controller with fixed buttons and joysticks into the perfect shoe for couch co-op and kicking back,\" goes the Xbox marketing blurb, like it's describing something perfectly normal and not an abrogation of humanity's duty to treat the Earth's fruits with care and respect. The part I find most displeasing, personally, are the analogue sticks, which arise like malignant fungal nodules from the dorsa of both of your feet.

Hence, diligent, accurate crediting is important for any creative's career, as well as just being the decent thing to do. In most cases, a credit is formulated as the developer's name and the nature of their role on the project, whether that's a fixed job title or a specific type of work they contributed on a part-time or freelance basis. But with the credits for Demonschool , developer Necrosoft Games went one step further, adding paragraph-long descriptions for every role on the project. This was highlighted by Necrosoft's design director Brandon Sheffield, who posted an image of some of Demonschool's credit to demonstrate their approach. \"Often you see credits in games where you don't know what the credited developer was actually responsible for.

When Apple claimed the ARM-based M5 had the best single-core performance in the world, it sure meant it. But can it game? While you used to be able to buy desktop Macs with Radeon cards in them, we haven't seen that for a while, and no M-series processor has yet been paired with any kind of discrete GPU. Apple instead relies on the integrated graphics cores and, for more powerful desktop machines, its ability to literally glue multiple chips together to increase their number, brute-forcing a solution to the problem by throwing more silicon at it.

Today, Ubisoft continued to pretend it never announced the Far Cry series at FX by announcing the Far Cry series at FX. Again. The details of the show are pretty much what we already knew, but this time, there are quotes to go along with them. So, that's something! \"What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo [another FX/Hawley joint] is a variation on a theme,\" said Hawley. Just like the Far Cry games, each season of the show will be \"set in a new setting following a new cast of characters,\" according to Ubisoft. \"Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created,\" Mac said, who will executive produce as well as star in the show (presumably in more than just the …",

I'd actually wondered how Steam Awards nominations would be handled in 2025. Typically it happens during the Steam Autumn Sale, but with Valve moving the Autumn Sale back a couple months to give us a proper break before the Winter Sale hits, that wasn't going to be an option. The answer was obvious in hindsight: Just make a whole other sale and cram it in there, which is exactly what Valve did with Steam's first ever Black Friday Sale . The nomination process for this year's Steam Awards will simplify things for you by listing eligible games you've played in 2025, as well as providing a rundown of \"popular and recommended games\" if you're more interested in being on the winning team than in throwing your support behind something you actually enjoyed.

It's no surprise that most BF6 players have made a habit of ignoring the LGT entirely by choosing to spawn directly on capture points or even run out of the HQ instead. Renegade_Soviet is not a normal BF6 player. Earlier today on the Battlefield subreddit, he posted a screenshot of something that I'd wager nobody else has seen in the wild: the Mad Max-ified \"Gold Standard\" skin for the LGT jeep, a reward for reaching rank 50 with the vehicle. \"Rank 50 for the death trap, never removing this badge,\" he wrote alongside the image. \"How,\" one commenter, who understood the implication of reaching the maximum level on a vehicle that's more likely to kill you than help you, replied.

Tavern Keeper arrived on Steam in November, but it's been in development for over a decade—and as impressive as the game is, that's a heck of a long development cycle, especially since it's expected to be in early access for at least another 12 months. I spoke last week with Patrick Klug, director and co-founder of Greenheart Games, and asked why the tavern sim took so long to belly up to the bar. \"We have made, like, six versions of this over the last 11 and a half years,\" Klug said, explaining that just the storybook system alone went through \"dozens of versions\" to become what is essentially an \"interactive audiobook\" where players get to make RPG-like dialogue choices while managing their pub. \"When we started, there were no tavern [management] games.

That's just too much sale all mush into one month. But if you thought that the shifted Autumn Sale meant no discounts on Steam in late November, boy, were you ever wrong. Because for the first time ever, Valve has capitulated to the gods of e-commerce and is holding its very own Black Friday Sale . Unlike many online retailers, who view Black Friday as one of the most important sell stuff holidays* of the year, Steam's Black Friday Sale is a relatively small affair compared to the seasonal heavyweights: It runs for just one week, and there are no attendant Points Shop freebies or trading cards to earn for hammering through your discovery queue. Which is not to say there aren't some sweet deals on offer, because there are.

As Tom Warren noted at The Verge , Microsoft did something similar earlier this year for Office, adding a feature called \"Startup Boost\" that loads parts of the Word application in the background so that it can launch more quickly. While I'm all for snappy software, I am a bit skeptical that either Word or the File Explorer should be such heavy applications that they need to be silently loading elements in the background before you click on them.

Even after the tutorial, it's frustrating trying to actually win a match until you unlock the Scholar profession, which isn't made clear at all. To save you a lot of rematches, this guide explains how to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet by unlocking the Scholar profession, and goes through how Gift of the Gab actually works once you can play it without tears dripping onto your keyboard. How to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet Let's just get this out of the way first: You're not going to win any Gift of the Gab matches in Where Winds Meet until you complete the Legacy: Scholar's Path quest and unlock the Scholar profession . Despite the fancy concept of studying your opponent's words and picking the correct comeback cards to win, Gift of the Gab is really a stat-based minigame—which means it's only winnable once you have access to stat boosts, card upgrades, and craftable talismans as part of the Scholar skill tree.

    "body": "Pay no attention to the well-heeled gentlemen whispering ' What if it's a bubble? ' behind the curtain—AI is the all-revolutionising tech that's here to change the world. Ubisoft reckons AI is a revolution for games on par with \"the shift to 3D.\" EA's buyers plan to lean on AI to make its $20 billion debt disappear. Microsoft's AI boss doesn't understand why some folk don't like AI ! Which, to be fair, might also be true for me if my generous executive pay package depended on me not understanding it. But one person who's not all in on the AI-fication of everything is voice actor Jennifer English, who you almost certainly know as Baldur's Gate 3's Shadowheart and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Maelle. In a chat with GamesRadar at this year's Golden Joystick Awards , English had one piece of advice for anyone looking to apply generative AI to games: \"Don't.\" Which is a pretty easy rule to follow, as rules go, but English does develop her thoughts a little further. \"I get it, that AI is a tool. I get it. But not for—not to replace creativity. Mistakes are beautiful. Flaws are wonderful. Keep them in. Keep it human. \"Be cool, guys. Don't be weird.\" Sage advice, and well-timed. It was o…",

As reported by Bloomberg , Intel denies claims that this hiring was made to take trade secrets from TSMC. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan told Bloomberg, \"It's rumor and speculation. There's nothing to it. We respect IP.\" TSMC isn't the only party looking to protect its IP. Kung Ming-hsin, the economy minister for Taiwan, reportedly said , “The Ministry of Economic Affairs will cooperate (with prosecutors) by explaining the current control mechanisms for Taiwan’s core technologies and by assessing whether there are any concerns related to the national security law.” As this is just being investigated, no formal charges or allegations have come forward just yet.

This annoying mechanic has only become more frequent with the various locked doors in Stella Montis that require you to haul a power cell around in the most dangerous map of all. Even if you're using stamina to move faster, it's so slow and I feel so incredibly vulnerable when carrying a heavy item that, quite frankly, I try to avoid it as much as possible. In fact, I rarely do Field Depots at all, even though they can contain some good loot; it would take a lot of convincing to get me to haul those crates around. Well, after over 50 hours with the game, I've just learned that there's a method to carrying these boxes faster; I didn't think it was even possible to carry them 'wrong'. It turns out that, against all laws of physics, you're actually faster carrying items backwards . Yes, turn around and run backwards while carrying a heavy object like a field crate or battery, and you'll somehow m…",

Granted, setting up the emulation in the first place is not a simple task and requires some brain-busting tinkering, but it's becoming more and more worthwhile since this time last year, when Bloodborne was first playable , though with caveats and crashes galore . There are also comprehensive guides available to steer you through the process of setting up the emulator and patching the game. A new video from tabeneru showcases a side-by-side comparison between the previous and current version of ShadPS4 on a PC equipped with Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU at 1440p with the framerate unlocked. Bloodborne's performance is far more stable now, more than doubling its average fps in some instances—far and away from sub double-figure lows. Deck Wizard also ran a test on the Steam Deck OLED in handheld and docked mode. While performance fluctuates more in handheld, it's hugging 60 fps much more frequently with lows averagi…",
