It's not busy compared to years prior, sure, but I'm thankful for the free time when I look ahead at the schedule for March. We really need a monthly limit on MMO and RPG releases or something—emphasis on the limit if you're combining the two. But until then there's more than enough to hold you over, including the brutally honest survival game Unemployment Simulator 2018 , and Edmund McMillen's turn-based adventures about selectively screwed up cats, Mewgenics. He thinks it's his best game yet, and Tyler may agree with him . As for myself, I'm kind of in a weird, creepy, cozy marathon until next month rolls in. I've been enjoying the adorably spooky lo-fi puzzles in Creature Kitchen's demo , and riding a man-eating elevator to hell in the co-op nightmare that is Kletka. It's out in 1.0 later this month, so I'm trying to break out of this mouthy contraption now before it adds any more Russian creepypastas to the menu.

At the time I remember thinking \"why would anyone want to play a new game in this style when there's already Minecraft, Ark and Rust?\". With the benefit of hindsight I know that two things worked in Valheim's favour. One was its clever finetuning of survival and building systems that still felt really clunky in competing games, and which many have since adopted. The other thing was Vikings. Valheim ruled so much that it was our favourite game of 2021 , and that was largely thanks to Vikings. Five years later Valheim is still in early access, but its updates come thick and fast and its community seems, by and large, pretty happy with how things are going. To celebrate the milestone, Iron Gate has issued a special anniversary update, or \"Patch 0.221.10\" in more prosaic terms. It features a bunch of nice things, like \"a celebratory hat\", a new weapon in the form of early axes (they're basically ancient dual-wieldable axes), and frosted sweetbread, which is a new consumable. There's a new radial menu for emotes, from which you can trigger new happy emotes like \"vibe\" or \"love you\" (do not perform the despair emot…",

Rose in picture, rose in name of game. Who could fault this theory? Alas, as cool as a remake of Rule of Rose would be, that's not what the teaser is teasing. Bloober Team CEO has confirmed as much on LinkedIn . \"Nice guess, but no,\" Piotr Babieno posted in response to an article by Twisted Voxel. \"It definitely doesn't refer to any remake.\" The teaser appeared at the URL remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com . In addition to the suspicious rose there's also the text \"some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait\", as well as a counter counting down to 11 days from now: on February 15. Andy Chalk listed all the various conspiracy theories that have arisen from this deliberately vague marketing tactic, in case you're interested.

Just don't grab the Divinity: Original Sin 2: Eternal Edition pack, also on Steam. For some reason, that's only been marked down 60%, or $10 more for only five of the series' six games⁠—the furtive Dragon Commander, so easily forgotten… 23 bucks feels like a steal for Original Sin 2 alone. Our 2017 game of the year remains a fresh, surprising RPG almost a full decade after launch. And don't believe the haters : Its magic/physical armor system is actually brilliant , and it's an incalculable loss for all mankind that Larian will not be revisiting it in the upcoming Divinity. That's just \"Divinity\" coming soon, nothing Divine, Beyond, 2, Dragon Commander, Original Sin, or Original Sin 2 about it.

So, wouldn't it make sense for Bethesda to make lightning strike twice? People love Skyrim even more than Fallout, so shouldn't Bethesda try to turn The Elder Scrolls into a TV series, too? Maybe not! Bruce Nesmith, lead designer on Skyrim, doesn't think so, anyway. In an interview with PressboxPR , Nesmith, who left Bethesda in 2021 during the development of Starfield, laid out the reasons it wouldn't make sense for Bethesda to try to duplicate what it's done with the Fallout show. \"What you have to realize about things like the Fallout TV show is that they don't make Bethesda money directly,\" Nesmith said. \"I would be shocked if Bethesda is making any money that they care about really, not when you make literally billions of dollars on Skyrim. What you're going to make by licensing the IP to this TV show is just peanuts.\" If the Fallout show isn't making Bethesda money, what is it doing? \"What it gets you is notoriety. It's marketing.

Not for much longer, though: Adobe announced today that Animate will soon be removed from sale, with support and access to the software ending over the next few years. According to an FAQ , Adobe Animate will no longer be available to purchase (it's actually a monthly subscription) starting March 1. After that, existing enterprise customers will be able to access the software and receive technical support until March 1, 2029, while customers with individual licenses only have until March 1, 2027 to keep using Adobe Animate. It may not be as popular as it was in the heyday of Newgrounds , but Adobe Animate is still used to make new shows, such as Star Trek: Lower Decks, as well as videogames. The animations for Mewgenics , the latest game from important Flash game designers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, were made in Adobe Animate. It's easy to tell: The Flash vector animation tools impart a distinctive look that defined the aesthetic of web games throughout the late '90s and 2000s. \"It cannot be overstated, fuck Adobe,\" said …",

I'd highly recommend you play them, or at least, play a little bit of them: they're pretty hard going by modern standards. Now's a better time than ever to become acquainted with this slice of PC gaming history: GOG is giving away the original Alone in the Dark trilogy right now. It's actually more than the original trilogy too, because it includes Jack in the Dark, a weird spin-off released between Alone in the Dark and its sequel about a kid stuck in a creepy toy store. While Alone in the Dark has many of the hallmarks of early survival horror, including tank controls, fixed camera perspectives, and near-unmanagable combat, newcomers may be surprised how much it borrows from point 'n' click adventures.

Well, making a new videogame for fans to buy and play would be a good start—but what if the TV show is Fallout and you're Bethesda? Since Fallout 5 could still be as much as a decade away, there's another possibility to keep Fallout fans busy with something new ish , at least: remasters of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. I imagine we'll probably get at least one of those remasters in the future: the same leak that was right about the Oblivion remaster also said a Fallout 3 remaster was in the works. So I guess the real question is: when? Naturally, fans are hoping it'll be sooner and not later—many even hope a remaster will be announced alongside the Fallout Season 2 finale this week—and Bethesda is doing its part to keep that hopium flowing. A new ad promoting Bethesda's Fallout games was posted today, and some fans claim it not-so-subtly suggests that a Fallout 3 remaster announcement is imminent. That's because the ad shows Aaron Moten, who plays Maximus on the Fallout TV series, inside Fallout 3. Hmm… In the ad, Moten is roommates with a giant Vault Boy mascot.

For me to see the forest for the trees is a little difficult. \"I can tell you candidly that when working at Bethesda up through the Skyrim days, Todd is probably one of the best bosses I've ever had. I can also tell you he's keenly aware of the fact that he is a bottleneck and he works his ass off to not do that. Unfortunately, he doesn't succeed very well.\" Nesmith is keen to emphasise that this isn't about mismanagement or \"something where he is being an ogre about it.

It's a pad designed for PC gaming on the sofa, and it removed the right thumbstick of a traditional controller and replaced it with a mouse-aping trackpad. With another trackpad on the left-hand side in place of the d-pad, you're dual-wielding... and stuck with a high learning curve and a pretty ugly look. However, some have sworn it's the way to go, once you're used to it, and I've had what I can only describe as a morbid curiosity ever since. It's fair to say that we at PC Gamer have never been the biggest fans of the Steam Controller, either. We got the chance to try it at GDC in 2014 , where we said, \"I would've absolutely had more fun and been more effective with an Xbox 360 controller.\" We then got to test it for its official launch the following year and were, again, not that impressed . We also weren't that into the idea of a second one back in 2022, though we did admit the Steam Deck owes its great controls to the controller. In fairness, with Valve eventually selling the controller for just $5 by the end of its life , it seems like the general controller-wielding masses weren't massively moved by it…",

Like all good ideas, it seems, Bell says the Shield project came from an enthusiastic group of engineers: \"Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console,\" Bell opines. \"To build a game console was pretty complicated because, of course, you have to have a GPU, which we know how to make... but in addition to that, you need a CPU, an OS, games, and you need a UI.\" Through a series of acquisitions and partnerships, (including the purchase of PortalPlayer in 2007, which led to the Tegra Arm chips at their hearts), Nvidia gradually gathered the elements that would make up its early Shield iterations .

Puget Systems also gives a shoutout to AMD's Ryzen X3D processors as having a better track record than its regular 9000-series chips, with a 1.51% failure rate, while Nvidia's Founders Edition GPUs are said to be the most reliable GeForce RTX cards sold by the company in 2025, with a mere 0.25% failure rate overall. The top processor may seem like a surprising pick, as it wasn't long ago that Intel was in the headlines for a host of CPU-crashing issues plaguing its older models. However, the Arrow Lake generation (along with microcode updates for 13th and 14th generation chips) appears to have steadied the ship considerably, and the 20-core Core Ultra 7 265K is something of a favourite around these parts, too.

Well, far from resting on their laurels, the team has since taken their efforts one step further (via Videocardz ). Thanks to the addition of an Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti PCB as its base and some clever power tweaking, the GPU-with-a-hole has managed to set a world record: the top spot in Unigine Superposition's online rankings for an RTX 5070 Ti, running the 8K optimized preset. Over the course of a seven-hour+ live stream , the team fought against a litany of issues to convince the Frank-o-card to perform properly, including an early problem with low-resolution-only output and voltage drops under load. A rat's nest of wires, the judicious use of yellow tape, and the odd cutting tool were used to reduce conductor resistance and voltage loss between the two cards—although it still seems to have the odd quirk worth looking into.

When Markiplier spotted that certain charts weren't displaying the movie's box office gross, Szymanski quote-reposted a thread discussing the observation with a Starship Troopers meme reading, \"It's afraid.\" When it first landed, it raked in a combined $12.5 million from Thursday previews and the Friday box office—that's over four times its estimated budget, which, as Forbes points out , is estimated to be just under $3 million. Not bad for a movie Markiplier wrote, co-produced, directed, and starred in himself, based on a game that's about an hour long.

The original two Fallout games are top-down, turn-based masterworks that, while pretty old, are landmark CRPGs and furnished the series with its iconic juxtaposition of atomic age aesthetics, grisly hyperviolence, and sardonic humor. The first Fallout game is my personal favorite, and don't let its vintage fool you—as 90s RPGs go, it's approachable.

    "body": "Alongside first-person shooters and real-time strategy games, the '90s was also the golden era of space combat simulators. From Star Wars: X-Wing to Freespace 2 , whipping out your joystick to blow up spaceships in nausea-inducing 3D spaceflight was a formative experience for every first-generation PC gamer. Among those space sims jostling for supremacy was Star Quest 1 in the 27 th Century . Developed by Virtual Adventures Inc and released in November 1995, its defining feature was how it allowed seamless transition between open space and planetary atmospheres, which technically put it decades ahead of games like No Man's Sky. Sadly, this wasn't enough to make Star Quest a big success, and the game's been largely forgotten in the interceding years. Until now, that is. Three decades since Star Quest first appeared, its designer Paul Lauzon has updated the space combat sim so that it works on modern machines, and re-released it over on itch. Best of all, you can download it for completely free. Lauzon announced the game's rerelease over on Reddit . \"I’m the original developer of Star Quest 1 in the 27th Century, first released in 1995,\" he wrote in the post. \"I spent the last few w…",

Not resting on its laurels, developer Turning Wheel has fed this success back into the game, resulting in one of its most significant updates ever. Titled Instruments of Destruction, the update is so big it's being delivered in two parts. The first part is available now, and it makes some pretty big changes to the Ultima Underworld -inspired RPG. The primary change is an overhaul to Barony's magic system, which replaces its magic, casting and swimming skills (one of which seems unlike the others) with three new skills that oversee all magical abilities. Sorcery is all about direct abilities like fireballs and magic shields, while Thaumaturgy focuses on buffs, piercing arcane secrets, and going ham on evil spirits.

    "summary": "It's not quite a draft phase, but it's called \"hero banning\" nonetheless.",
    "body": "There's no greater pain in a MOBA than seeing your favorite hero swept into the swirling void of unplayability by a hero ban, but it’s a necessary evil, at least for buttoned-up ranked play. Bans make picking and counterpicking more interesting and keep imbalanced characters off the field while players wait for a balance patch—and to my delight, Deadlock has finally got them. Well, sort of. What it's actually added is a “prefer to avoid” toggle you can assign to one hero from the game's roster when queuing for both standard play (which is always ranked) and Street Brawl, the new casual mode analogous to League of Legends's ARAM or Valorant's Spike Rush. You also can't avoid new heroes, which currently just applies to the six characters from Old Gods, New Blood . The patch notes, which you can find on Deadlock’s feedback forum , call this a hero banning system, but there are a few reasons for both why this is different and why it might be necessary for a game in pre-alpha. Most ranked modes in MOBAs have a draft phase—a pre-game lobby where both teams take turns selecting heroes for their team and banning them so that no one can play them in that match. In League of Legends, for in…",

    "body": "If you read the history books of the 16th century, Sayyida al-Hurra will rarely show up. The powerful women of the Mediterranean and Islam typically don't, except as footnotes or asides. So her leadership, piracy and plundering for her people never quite made the major texts. But the \"pirate queen\" of Morocco is finally receiving her due, at least in videogame form, as one of the playable heroes in Civilization 7 's recent Tides of Power Collection DLC—thanks in part to the digging of one University of Kansas professor. \"[Al-Hurra] is fascinating,\" says Finn Taylor, senior narrative designer at Firaxis Games for the 4X strategy title. \"She was highly educated, greatly respected by both friends and foes, and accomplished remarkable feats during a challenging time in Moroccan history.\" Her last name is actually an honorific title, meaning \"free,\" and is given to those who lead—similar to a regional mayor. When Amal El Haimeur, an assistant professor at the University of Kansas, ran across her name as an aside in a book, she was immediately curious. Sayyida was one of two women in El Haimeur's memory to hold the title, and the only one in Morocco. \"It became a research question for m…",

The ban notice cites \"harassment, threats, and/or abuse of other players,\" but it appears that the actual reason was that Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking, was already a registered sex offender at that point. A 2013 email to Jeffrey Epstein's account notifying him that his Xbox Live account has been banned. (Image credit: DOJ files) In 2012, Xbox and other gaming companies began working with New York State to ban registered sex offenders from their platforms. Sony, EA, Warner Bros, Disney, Blizzard, and Apple were also part of the agreement, according to a 2012 New York Times article . After the ban notice, Epstein also received a notice explaining the cause. \"This message is to notify you that Xbox LIVE has permanently suspended the Xbox LIVE account associated with this email address,\" reads the second email. \"This action is based on the New York Attorney General's partnership with Microsoft and other online gaming companies to remove New York registered sex offenders from online gaming …",

Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . Grand Theft Auto has always thrived on an outsider’s perspective. There’s something sardonically Scottish about its trademark tone—the relentless skewering of American excess and absurdity, paired with a loving recreation of the country’s most iconic cities. You can feel the awe of a tourist in the way your field-of-view shifts as you stare up at the skyscrapers of Liberty City—a technical trick that induces a kind of grounded vertigo. Yet Rockstar had never so explicitly embraced the outsider before GTA 4. Niko Bellic is quite literally fresh off the boat, propelled by his cousin’s fanciful promises of riches, as well as the horror of the Balkan wars behind him. \"I had been living in New York for a few years,\" Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser told the Lex Fridman podcast two months ago. \"I was single and miserable, and I…",
