From the game's opening seconds it's obvious this was a massive labour of love for Harmonix, the studio that had kicked-off the whole genre with the original Guitar Hero. Many of those involved in bringing the project to life have now given interviews for The Oral History of Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Music Game Boom , a newly released book by journalist Blake Hester, with an excerpt detailing some of those initial meetings published on Design Room . The chapter begins with some of the initial enquiries and how the project got started, largely thanks to George Harrison's son Dhani already being a fan of Guitar Hero.

The Mortuary Assistant was something of a surprise hit in 2022: A game that puts players in the shoes of a fresh-out-of-college apprentice mortician who's called into work late one night to handle some unexpected embalmings. But this, it turns out, is not a normal day at the office. Your boss had the good sense to stay home, but you are not alone: Before long you're not only preparing the deceased for their funerals, you're also conducting occult rituals to ward off demonic forces. Talk about multi-tasking! I suppose it's inevitable at this point, three years after the release of the game, but the trailer for the film adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant doesn't land quite as well for me as the game did. The game, at least in the early going, is relatively subtle: Creepy as hell, yes, but things happen slowly at first, and the tension is elevated by the inherent unpleasantness (for me, anyway) of routine mortician work.

Arrowhead said on January 16, a few days after Redacted Regiment was revealed, that \"during final testing for the Warbond, we found a key issue that didn't meet our standards for a release .\" Some fans have speculated that effectively working stealth into Helldivers 2—which in my experience is very much a not -stealthy game—may have proven more complicated than expected. Coming as close as it did to the warbond's release, though, I feel like the problem had to be fairly specific rather than broadly conceptual. Despite being well known for the various…",

Players were given the opportunity to vote in November as to whether they'd like the widely reviled Treasure Hunter microtransactions removed: Obviously, they said yes , and that's one of the first items on the 2026 roadmap unveiled today. The accompanying blog post states it \"represents more than a milestone; it’s a turning point—one that sets RuneScape firmly on course for the future it deserves.\" The plans detailed in the post are already in motion, as Treasure Hunter is already out of the game. Players will have the year to use up whatever items they've already bought, \"with additional chances later in the year to clear out anything that remains, before [hundreds of gameplay-impacting MTX] items are ultimately made obsolete.\" Plenty more was shown off with the new roadmap. …",

More than five years after it was first revealed , it still remains the stuff of imagination: It's been three years since Greg Street, the then-VP who announced the project, left Riot , and two years since Riot \"reset\" development , and we still have nothing to show for it but promises that yes, it is still happening. It might look from the outside like the whole thing is floundering, but it appears that the wheels are turning, or at least that someone is revving the engine with intent: Riot has now added former World of Warcraft lead producer Raymond Bartos to its MMO development team. \"From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values—and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process,\" Bartos wrote on LinkedIn (via MassivelyOP ). \"It made it obvious that kindness, respect, and care aren’t just words here, but something the team truly lives by. \"I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can’t wait to get started—showing up every day to provide value for…",

Enter the DockFrame , a USB-C hub with modular ports you can swap out. Though not officially affiliated, the project is designed to work with the hot-swappable hardware standard used by Framework's expansion cards . A custom PCB is both compatible with any Framework USB-C modules you may have lying around as well as the DockFrame's own 'Tool Cards.' These Tool Cards are a little extra, planning to offer functionality beyond the I/O ports you'd traditionally see on a desktop—such as voltage measuring and even adjustable voltage output.

This versatile little tri-laser beamer seeks to follow your lead, and light up your life with a cornucopia of practical portability features. I wouldn't say you're looking at a projector as much as you're looking at a technological druid packing the Wild Shape spell. In all my years of reviewing tech it's become painfully clear that a plentiful feature set usually points to at least a couple of small caveats. No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer. Any piece of tech that can shift from projector, to soundbar, to fancy lightshow with the flick of some far-out mechanism gives me a palpable dopamine hit. That's what Xgimi is pandering to with the MoGo 4 Laser: tech fiends with a penchant for adaptable equipment. At any moment, a swift attachment of one of the…",

VR headsets are becoming fairly popular, but the dream of putting on a headset and seamlessly teleporting to an immerse new world, while my lounge room fades away, is yet to be realised. While modern headsets have come a long way, they either lack the visual fidelity to fool the eyes, the comfort to convince the body, or more likely a bit of both. The Pimax Crystal Super is an example of a headset that does a lot to solve one of these problems, while kinda forgetting about the other. The Pimax Crystal Super boasts some pretty impressive specs, but as such needs a mighty PC to run. Pimax recommends you have at least an RTX 2070 to run the thing, but realistically, if you’re running anything less than a 4080 then you’re not going to scratch the surface of this impressive display. There’s simply no reason to drop the $2,000 on this headset without a high-end PC to power it. You’re far better off grabbing a lower specced VR set-up and upgrading later. You’re also beholden to Pimax’s software, which acts as a driver hub and is required to be configured to play some games li…",

Oh, but ignore me. I’m just too British to understand this emotion you humans call ‘joy’. A fairly rote save-the-universe-from-aliens plot is livened up considerably by constant silly digressions.

Nexus announced the news on its site last week (via GamingOnLinux ), writing that it has stopped making sense—if indeed it ever did—to divide its development efforts between two separate mod managers that aimed to do the same thing (uh, manage mods). \"Instead of moving forward together, we were splitting our focus. Every feature built twice. Every bug fixed in two places. Every conversation about 'which one should I use' was a reminder that we were competing with ourselves instead of solving the actual problems in front of us.\" The short and the tall of it is that \"We're stopping development on the Nexus Mods App and focusing all our efforts on Vortex.\" Which, sure, makes sense.

It's hard to know when to expect the features, though 2027 is the earliest window players might see it. MMOs with both crossplay and cross-progression are exceedingly rare compared to their PC-exclusive or otherwise cordoned-off counterparts, and given what sort of trouble arises squeezing all those players together on a single platform, it's no surprise this sort of thing takes a lot of extra work.

Adamantite is a rare, mid- to end-game material, and with that comes a pretty annoying and dangerous search. Don't worry though, I'll let you know where to look for adamantite ore so you can skip to the best bit: Smelting the ore into ingots and making powerful items. How to get adamantite in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) You can find adamantite ore on the surface and inside caves in the Devastated Lands, the volcanic fourth zone. The Devastated Lands is a very dangerous and gloomy area, so I recommend bringing the best gear you can currently craft, plenty of food, and lots of torches. As you'd expect, adamantite ore can spawn underground inside caves. I've found that the deeper you go, the better your chances of finding adamantite, though there are no strict spawning restrictions based on depth like Minecraft. Importantly, adamantite also…",

The main hurdle is that the area you need to reach isn't somewhere I'd recommend you visit on a vacation—too much lava and reanimated skeletons. Grab the best sword and armour you can craft (most likely thorium or cobalt), as both options for getting cindercloth scraps in Hytale require a fair bit of fighting. Don't worry, it'll be worth it for that sweet, sweet adamantite gear. How to get cindercloth scraps in Hytale (Image credit: Hypixel) The best way to get cindercloth scraps early on in Hytale is to kill fire-themed incandescent skeletons in the volcanic biome underground in the first zone, Emerald Grove. If you've not been to this area yet, explore deep underground caves in the starting zone until you see embers in the air, volcanic rock, and lots of lava—you'll know you're in the right place.

In fact, the mobo sports a veritable smorgasbord of gadgets, extras, and options , all designed to make it as user-friendly as possible. I also have to say that the whole thing really does look very nice. However, one of the last Asus motherboards I reviewed, the TUF Gaming B860M-Plus WiFi , was anything but user-friendly.

Below, I'll outline where you can find sturdy chitin in Hytale, so you're not wandering aimlessly through the zones. I hope you like bugs because, I'll warn you now, the enemies you need to hunt down are truly horrifying. How to get sturdy chitin in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) You can get sturdy chitin from killing the following mobs in the Howling Sands zone , which is the desert biome: Scarak Defender, Fighter, Louse, Seeker, and Broodmother Scorpions Armadillos Tortoises Given that the relatively harmless mobs on the surface, like tortoise, only give one or two sturdy chitin each, your best bet is hunting down Scarak mobs, especially inside their underground nests. While exploring caves in the Howling Sands, keep an eye out for grey/brown spotty blocks, as these indicate a Scarak nest. …",

We have to go back in time to a little over a year ago, to when the founder of Amazon was interviewed by Andrew Ross Sorkin at the 2024 New York Times DealBook Summit . At one point, Bezos recalls a time when he was in Luxembourg, visiting a brewery. \"This trip was one of the little tiny catalysts for the founding of AWS (Amazon Web Services, founded 2002), and the brewery was 300 years old. This company [had been] making beer for 300 years … they had a museum, and in that museum was an electric power generator, 100 years old. \"When they wanted to improve the efficiency of their brewery with electricity, there was no power grid, so they had to build their own power station … they made their own electricity, and at that time, that's what everybody did if a hotel wanted electricity: they had their own electric generator.\" Why was he rambling on …",

Depending on when you're reading this, it might've done it already, given the patch launches on January 20. Alright, \"kneecap\" is harsh. Blizzard's made an effort through rounds of beta testing, and continual conversations with addon developers, to try and thread the needle between functionality and form. Basically, the developer doesn't want addons to be required—but anything that's cosmetic can stay . This means obvious things, like roleplay, map, and bag addons are all fine; It also means there's wiggle room in the combat addon sphere for presentation, which is nice for customisability, but it also means that certain accessibility features made by addon creators over the years can be maintained. Or so, Blizzard hopes. This also involves a lot of class redesign.

That's good news for people who love shiny new things, but it's bad news for those who love old things, because when Kiwami 3 releases the remastered version of Yakuza 3 will be harder to buy. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio confirmed as much on Saturday. \"Those who already own Yakuza 3 Remastered will still be able to continue playing it,\" the company posted on X , but \"for those new to the series who wish to experience the original version, it will be available with purchase of the Yakuza Complete Series bundle.\" The Yakuza Complete Series bundle is $130 on Steam when it's not on sale, and it's a pretty good deal if you want, oh, probably around 500 hours worth of Yakuza games. If you want to buy Yakuza 3 Remastered separately it'll set you back $20, though both the bundle and the standalone Yakuza 3 go on sale pretty damn regularly: the latter often goes for around $6.

Viewers expecting something like 2023's Monster Hunter Wilds reveal or the one-two Matrix Unreal Engine 5 tech demo and Matrix 4 trailer in 2021 have been taking out their frustrations on Highguard. The reveal was drowned out by hot takes calling out its \"Concord vibes\" and it received a ghastly 2,400 dislikes on YouTube compared to around 500 likes when it first dropped.

But just as all life ends in death, all digital gaming commerce ends in a cut for GabeN. Last Friday, New Blood CEO Dave Oshry said on X that Blood West's free giveaway on the Epic Games Store was a boon for the game… on Steam, where it sold \"like 200% more\" that day. He was quote-reposting a meme with over 40,000 likes expressing the sentiment that a cheap game on Steam is preferable to a free game on EGS. In the thread, he elaborated: \"I used to think EGS was a Marketing Black Hole but turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!\" He added that console sales spiked, as well. Is the Epic Games launcher really that bad? It's already got a huge install base since you need it to play one of the most popular games on Earth , and ev…",

If you're a PC gamer, your cup runneth over so much that you may still be catching up on the year's biggest hits even now, and you're not alone. In fact, one industry analysis group reckons Dec. 2025 was Steam's highest-grossing December ever. That estimation comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics , which reported that last month saw over 100 million Steam users generate $1.6 billion dollars in gross revenue. That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history. The report explains \"that’s up 22.7% over December 2024 and even more than December 2020’s pandemic-driven high of $1.4 billion.\" The report also notes that Arc Raiders is the second-biggest breadwinner of the season⁠—the first is eternally Counter-Strike 2, as dictated by the laws of physics—with a staggering 1.2 million copies sold just in the weeks between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4. As the article puts it, \"the brakes are broken on the ARC Raiders train,\" with the game selling 12 million copies overall. 250,000 copies were apparently sold on Boxing Day alone, with almost 3.2 million players checking in and half of them…",

Impressively, it's the first mod by TheCrowKnight, who says it contains \"A host of terrifying new enemies,\" as well as \"Three boss battles\" and \"over 350 professionally voice acted lines.\" Most of those voice lines presumably belong to the villainous lich Malkifer and a bard named Adabelle you'll be tasked with rescuing, though the credits also include \"The Undead Blacksmith\". The Rot Below also includes new magical items, including glowy enchanted swords, and conjuration spells that let you summon new undead servants. Maybe even some of the mushroom-headed skeletons who appear in the trailer. There's new music too, so if like me you muted Skyrim's repetitive score a hundred hours ago, maybe turn the volume back up for this one. You can download The Rot Below from Nexus Mods. …",

It's made a pretty penny already, enough to fund two years of further development, and crucially, it's actually good . PC Gamer senior editor Christopher Livingston said in his impressions that the game \"has a long road ahead\" but \"what's here and working works well.\" The Hytale Team seems keen to keep the momentum up, as just four days after release, players have already been treated to a sizable update . It kicks off with a patch note containing the two most beautiful words in the English language: \"added dinosaurs.\" It's a good sign that the team has its priorities straight. But that's not all. There are some new character creation options, a slew of bug fixes including several crash fixes, and some balance changes addressing some fundamental-sounding problems: \"weapon attacks should now check for line of sight,\" for example. Some placeholder assets and animations have been traded for more polished ones, and \"cautious wildlife predators\" have been adjusted so that they don't attack you unless you give them a reason to. You can find the full patch notes…",

Serious enough to pull a gun in the middle of a store, apparently, as NBC reported happening during a robbery in Manhattan on January 14. No one was hurt, fortunately, but the trio of robbers brandished handguns and smashed open several display cases full of merchandise at the Poké Court on 13th Street. They stole what store owner Courtney Chin estimates is $100,000 in merchandise. The thieves remain at large. Now, I know what you're thinking. This crime, though unfortunate, is sort of novel and maybe even a little funny because a Pokémon store was robbed and not a bank or an art museum. That's why you're reading it on PC Gamer, after all. Typically, the only heists we cover involve Payday 3 or the latest crypto nonsense ⁠—who the heck steals Pokémon merch at gunpoint? But a brief trip down the rabbit hole informed me that this Pokéheist is embarrassingly mundane. Earlier this month , a similar robbery in Los Angeles involving the creature collector netted some armed thieves triple the payday of the above case. The same weekend, another ro…",

It seems to be paying off, as developer Moon Studios announced Thursday that the game has moved one million copies on Steam in early access, though it is about to share at least one thing in common with Diablo: 4-player co-op . The co-op announcement comes with a lavish trailer showing the feature off, and states it will launch Jan. 22. I haven't tried the game myself yet in solo play or otherwise, but seeing a gaggle of heroes take on a huge boss together certainly makes it pop. The game's model for co-op, which was detailed in a lengthy explainer video from Moon Studios in Dec. 2025, is \"similar to how realms work in Minecraft, the only difference being you don't have to pay for a subscription.\" What that means is that rather than Dark Souls invasions, Diablo 4's quasi-MMO open world, or other ARPGs' multiplayer systems where a single player's save file is used, No Rest for the Wicked will distinguish between persistent multiplayer saves and offline single-player saves.

I think I just ate a compass. By that I mean a magnetic one, not a pointy one used to draw circles. I'm not stupid. I just can't see, you see, and when you can't see it's a lot harder to tell whether an object you just picked up might be edible. Hence, when I plucked a star-shaped object off a door and my inventory labelled it as \"food?\" as it does with everything, down it went, costing me two points of health and any chance of knowing where north is. Not that a compass would have been much use to me anyway, given the whole lack of vision thing. This would probably be the weirdest thing to happen in most games.
