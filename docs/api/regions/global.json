And, even as someone who has literally never sat atop a horse, I have no shame in admitting that I was the first to fall. However, if you haven't noticed your gaming library or day-to-day life becoming infected with these powerful beasts, it's probably because you haven't realised just how significant horses have been. Because I'm not talking about the games that are basically ranch simulators for the most part. Although they have had their time in the spotlight, with the full launch of The Ranch of Rivershine, Barbie Horse Trails, and Sound of Horses, it's more so a plethora of updates and expansions that have put a particular emphasis on horses, which has led me to believe that 2025 has been the y…",

Despite a lacklustre GPU generation and the RAMpocalypse , this year's PC gaming hardware has made me very happy. That's because 2025 has seen some meaningful, non-gimmicky leaps forward in competitive FPS gaming hardware. And no, I'm not talking about unreasonably high refresh rates on monitors—although the ones from Asus I saw at Gamescom did impress me, whether OLED or TN —I'm talking about peripherals. On the mouse front, we've had a big leap in how light a sturdy wireless gaming mouse can go with the 36 g Corsair Sabre V2 Pro . But then there's what a mouse sits atop: the humble mouse pad. I can't say I thought my years of testing and writing about PC gaming hardware would lead to writing so much about a mouse pad, but here we are: My favourite piece of 'hardware' from this year was a mouse pad. The pad in question, the SteelSeries QcK Performance , isn't just your run-of-the-mill mat, though. Hear me out. Over the last couple of decades of PC gaming, I've tried variations on what have ultimately been the same kinds of mouse pad. Rubber base, cloth top…",

We've all done it: excitedly told a friend that they should read a book (or play a game, watch a movie, etc) that you think they will like. Then you wait. You wait for weeks.

The Sims has been churning out DLC before people even knew what to call it, and 25 years later we're practically drowning in all of the extra add-ons and doodads you can hand over your precious money for. But just how many of them can you actually name? Can you still recall all seven original Sims expansion packs from memory, or have you somehow catalogued all 52 of the expansion, game, and stuff packs that are in The Sims 4 as of this quiz going live? Yep, you read that right—The Sims 4 alone accounts for over half of the paid DLC available across the entire series. That's even excluding the fact that I've deigned not to include kits in this list—there are simply too damn many of them (48 at the time of writing, almost all of the rest of The Sims 4's DLC combined) and are churned out at such a rate that I imagine there'll be anothe…",

    "body": "2025 was a year of highs and lows for me. Not for personal or professional reasons, but rather because I got weirdly obsessed with the height of videogame characters. It started with the surprising revelation that every FromSoftware protagonist outside of Elden Ring Nightreign is exactly 5'7\", a fact I learned from a YouTube investigation by FromSoft savant Zullie the Witch. I'd always assumed FromSoftware protagonists were taller than this. I'm not sure why, but it's probably due to how Anglo-American entertainment media has programmed my brain to perceive heroic archetypes as tall, dark and handsome. So finding out that all FromSoft's dodge-rolling warriors are the same height as me was surprising, leading me to think more deeply about how we represent height in games. Some of this manifested in bizarre tangents, like when I bugged Arkane Studios level designer and The Black Parade director Romain Barrilliot to help me figure out the height of Garrett from Thief. Interestingly, it turns out that Garrett's height varies across the games. He's exactly six feet tall in Thief: The Dark Project , slightly taller in Thief 2: The Metal Age (though this extra couple of inches may be pur…",

It takes a lot for a farming simulator to really impress me these days—I'm sure most avid cozy gamers will sympathise with me when I say that. Stardew Valley has had a lasting impact on me, let alone the cozy gaming space in general, and finding something that really lives up to the excitement of venturing into Pelican Town for the first time is becoming more and more challenging. The genre continues to grow each year too, which is definitely making it harder to sift through and find a real diamond in the rough. However, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar showed me that you don't always have to present something brand new to make an impact. I've always liked Story of Seasons games, especially when I was younger.

But 2025 isn't over just yet so, while I've got the breathing room, I'm gonna fill my lungs and shout about the SSDs that impressed us the most this year. Unlike last year , no teeny-tiny 2230 form factor drives get a look in this year. Obviously, handheld gaming PCs are no less popular, but internal NVMe SSDs have simply had a stronger showing this year. However, that doesn't mean this is anything like a one horse race—even our best SSD for gaming has a veritable stable full of anime horse girls . Confusing metaphors? Me? Never. Anyway, keeping things interesting, it's not just one brand dominating the nominee top spots.

This year has been a bit of a weird one for gaming handhelds. AMD's mighty Strix Halo chip launched at CES, yet it's too power hungry and hot to see its inclusion in anything we can actually use right now. AMD's Z Extreme range is still going strong, though, with the Z1 Extreme making for a good mid-range handheld, and the new Z2 Extreme powering the surprisingly capable Asus ROG Xbox Ally X . The Xbox Ally X had to do an awful lot to justify the very premium price point, but smart software, a comfortable fit, and excellent performance make it a standout choice for the 1% of the gaming world. Despite its latest range of desktop chips being a bit of a letdown, Intel managed to put out some fierce mobile chips, too. The Core Ultra 7 258V powering the MSI Claw 8 AI+ seems to be one of the standouts, giving excellent performance. However, the chip isn't the only thing that makes a device, and our favourite gaming handhelds of this year pack a punch in the look, feel, and battery life departments.

There are many deserving of a nomination, from the excellent Havn BF 360 to the return of a legend, the Corsair Air 5400. But I had to go with my gut. One product stands out to me in a sea of increasingly expensive components. It's the Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro , and here's why. I first caught sight of the Liquid Freezer III Pro at Computex, Taiwan's biggest tech show. I arrived at Arctic's booth in a bit of a mess, having essentially jogged between appointments most of the morning in the stuffy weather. I spent an undue amount of time admiring the new Liquid Freezer Pro, if only for a brief respite as the cool air from its fans reached my face. It wouldn't be easy to improve upon the original Liquid Freezer III. Our Nick rated the original model so highly that he awarded it our no.1 spot in our best liquid cooler buying guide.

Until Larian unveiled Divinity, we didn't know what it was doing next—only that it wouldn't be Baldur's Gate 4. At GDC 2024, about nine months after BG3's release, Larian boss Swen Vincke dropped a bombshell: The studio would not make an expansion pack or sequel to its most successful game to date, and was parting ways with Wizards of the Coast and D&D entirely. But they sure took their time saying goodbye, huh? Cyberpunk 2077 is the only recent singleplayer game I can think of that has received more free, post-launch additions⁠—and that was in response to a deeply compromised launch. Baldur's Gate 3 started on top, and just kept climbing. Before Vincke's early 2024 farewell, BG3 had already gotten the überhard, permadeath Honour Mode, as well as an expanded, playable epilogue.

In 2025, as graphics cards, memory, and storage have become harder to find at reasonable prices, monitors have only become better value. So, should you have the rig to run it, there has never been a better time to upgrade to a 4K screen. Philips remains in good form, with its Evnia 27M2N3800A being arguably the best-priced 4K panel we've seen (and with a neat dual resolution mode). MSI just barely missed out on a nomination for its 271QR OLED monitor , which is a bright and super snappy panel. Acer, Asus, LG, and AOC all had strong showings this year, too, but in such a packed year, you need to pick just a handful and the Alienware and KTC below just managed to beat them out. Our Alienware pick is super quick, with a gorgeous HDR QD-OLED panel. The KTC monitor is a bit of an underdog without the recognisable name of Philips or Alienware, yet it's still a punchy, quick and affordable 1440p panel.

With Nvidia releasing a whole new generation of graphics chips (and you can bet I've been testing a ton of those as well...), the best gaming laptop manufacturers have been hard at work either respinning their old machines to make way for the new GPU silicon, or completely redesigning their laptop chassis for a new year. And the very first one to land in my lap this year was definitely the latter, with the Razer Blade 16 popping up with a new design intent on taking the crown back from Asus. The ROG Zephyrus G16 was the hands-down winner last year, with a mix of stylish, slimline chassis and impressive gaming performance, while Razer's finest of 2024 looked bloated by comparison.

Importantly, this one isn't quite so subjective as most 'best of' collections because it reflects something that's really important in PC gaming: performance . I don't just mean outright frame rates, though that's no small matter. You can have a game that runs at well over 200 fps, but if the graphics are all wonky donkey, or the whole thing is less stable than a block-away-from-disaster game of Jenga, then it'll be no fun to play. Over the past 12 months, we've dug deep into the performance, graphics, and development quality of 13 games released this year. The majority of these, plus many others that we've played and tested (but not done a full analysis of), were basically fine: not great, not bad, merely okay.

He's the same age as he was in last season's flashback to the immediate aftermath of the bombing, so we know something's likely to go wrong even as we tour idyllic suburbs patrolled by NCR troopers—one in veteran ranger armor complete with duster and gas mask. Max's father hands his mother a jar of pure rad-free water (siphoned from Vault 33, which is how they came to Rose MacLean's attention in the first place), and Jo Stafford sings You Belong to Me.

There's something fascinating about taking an artefact you're intensely familiar with and filtering it through the lens of a different culture, philosophy, and language.

I've taken the (English) names of 12 reasonably well-known videogames and plugged them into machine translation. Then I did it again. Then again. And again. And again. From English, through Yiddish, Punjabi, Mandarin, Yoruba… on and on it went, until the final translation—back into English—returned something that really bears very little resemblance to the game's original name at all.

We're talking Alpha Protocol, Neverwinter Nights 2, New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, Tyranny, and yes, even South Park: The Stick of Truth. That's an incredible list of games, and while some of them are looking a bit long in the tooth these days, I can't bring myself to not recommend every single one of them—and that's not just because PCG news writer Josh Wolens would curse me if I badmouthed Alpha Protocol.

    "summary": "If RAM prices are making a PC upgrade impossible, maybe 2026 is the year for a new gaming monitor?",
    "body": "Samsung has announced a slew of epic-looking new PC gaming monitors ahead of the CES show in January. Highlights include a 32-inch 6K model with glasses-free 3D support, plus a 1080p panel with 1,040 Hz refresh. The latter notably, if marginally, pips Philips and AOC's new 1,000 Hz gaming monitors to the high-refresh prize. But let's start with that 6K beauty. The new Samsung Odyssey 3D G9 G90XH is a 32 incher. Resolution-wise, it's the same 6,144 by 3,456 pixels as some existing 6K monitors, like the LG UltraFine Evo 32U990A-S . However, where that LG tops out at 60 Hz, the Samsung Odyssey 3D is good for 165 Hz at native 6K. It also offers an alternate 330 Hz mode running at 3K. In theory, that means the 330 Hz mode is an integer scale of 6K, so the image quality could be quite good. Intriguingly, it uses an IPS panel, not the VA tech that Samsung is known for. Response is quoted at 1 ms GtG. As if all that wasn't enough, and as its name suggests, the Samsung Odyssey 3D sports glasses-free 3D tech with eye tracking. I reviewed this kind of technology before, albeit on an Acer monitor, the Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27 , and not come away entirely convinced. In this context, m…",

School Idol Festival. Prior to this year, it's genuinely difficult for me to recall gaps where I wasn't neck deep in some free-to-play currency multiplicity. I jumped ship to dress-up game Love Nikki, and then to Bang Dream! Girls Band Party. But hey, at least these things were only contained to my phone. At least I'm not juggling them across my console and PC, too. (Image credit: Infold Games) Except, oops, now it's 2020. The world's gone to shit, everything's still on lockdown, and little-known Chinese developer miHoYo has just put its Breath of the Wild clone Genshin Impact on my newly-purchased PlayStation 5. Surely that thing won't usher in a new age of gacha games, broadening their appeal to the masses and inviting a plethora of even more open world free-to-play action games riddled with real-money purchases, right?

Sadly, festive first-person shooters are thin on the ground for some inexplicable reason. But as is so often the case, the FPS community has filled this smoking bullet-hole left by developers, decking PC gaming's gore-spattered halls with boughs of holly through the power of mods. To help fellow FPS-heads get into the Christmas spirit, I've put together a roundup of the best Christmas-themed mods for PC gaming's most renowned shooters (plus one additional stocking filler that I think should be brought to your attention).

So far, I haven't been disappointed. We've seen numerous key locations in just the first couple of episodes, like Vault 24 and the Starlight Drive-In . And now, in the second episode, we've had a magnificent look at Area 51, as it was unveiled after the Brotherhood got its hands on cold fusion. (Image credit: Prime TV) The showrunners again proved how dedicated they are to depicting the Wasteland with care, a fact that executive producer Todd Howard raised during my interview: \"I always view the biggest character being the world. I think everybody involved with the show has taken such amazing care to treat locations with this obsessive authenticity. And I think that's what people like, and it's all practical, or most of it, right? More so than other shows or movies. \"They built so much of it. You walk on set,…",

Several times a week, if not every single day, I scan the news, press releases, and entertainment sites for any info about new game-related adaptations. So how the heck did I miss that there was a whole new live action Witcher movie. On Netflix. Starring Dolph Lundgren. And it came out in October of this year. It wasn't just me: a bunch of us at PC Gamer, movie fans and Witcher fans alike, missed it too. It's called The Rats: A Witcher Tale , a feature-length special that serves as a prequel to Season 4, and you can watch it right now on Netflix—though judging from evidence I'm about to present, I'm not sure Netflix really wants you to. Exhibit A: Netflix didn't do a heck of a lot to tell people about this movie. I get mail from Netflix in both my professional and personal inboxes, and they sent nothing about this special. Zilch. I also have an account on a Netflix press site that has absolutely zero mention of it. Odd. Weirder still, I searched the official YouTube channel and there's no trailer or even a teaser for it.

But while CD Projekt is now full steam ahead on The Witcher 4 , there are rumblings—not much more than vibrations, really—of something new coming for Witcher 3. Ears pricked up following a Strefa Inwestorów report ( Google translated ) quoting Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski predicting a Witcher 3 expansion for May 2026. \"We expect another paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026,\" Chrzanowski said. \"We anticipate sales of 11 million copies at USD 30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million ($14.5 million). The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for The Witcher 4.\" That's not a whole lot to go on, but it does make sense. Chrzanowski also said he expects The Witcher 4 to launch in Q4 2027, which puts it in the admittedly massively open-ended time frame of 'not until after 2026' previously shared by CD Projekt. New Witcher 3 DLC would also be a guaranteed moneymaker. Some quick napkin math: CD Projekt has now sold more than 60 million copies, and if we assume a DL…",

Today I learned that it also does damage, and someone is currently trying to beat the entire game with it, because of course they are. YouTube user Bloblumordthe3rd calls the playthrough \"Garama%\" and releases a new video every week or so showing off their progress. They are by no means racing through the game with an ability that can only be barely described as lethal: Every fight takes ages as they patiently wait for the best moment to Garama! It took two hours of attempts to defeat the final boss of act 1, for example.

Anything else is an anomaly, but I'm happy to report that, at the behest of no one, I played Complusion's gothic action adventure game South of Midnight three times over the last eight months, so I reckon that means I like it.

Here's a revision, courtesy of roadtrip RPG Keep Diving : A hitchhiker is just a friend you haven't met who might have weed. As I said in my Keep Driving review , I grew up in the US in a town that had—like many towns in the US—no real public transportation, so my first taste of real freedom was when I got my first car, a heavily used hand-me-down green Plymouth Horizon hatchback. I loved that clunky car, mostly because of what it represented: a chance to escape my house and my town and set out on the road with no real destination, only occasionally checking the map, blasting music, and paying for gas a few dollars at a time. Gotta save some cash for snacks. Keep Driving delivers impeccable vibes from a time when the stress of school was slowly being replaced by the clawing panic of having to figure out what comes after school. A real job. Re…",

There's a lot to love about its depiction of post-nuclear Boston if you're willing to overlook the fact that you solve most problems with a gun. One aspect of Fallout 4 I haven't considered much, however, is its replayability. But it's a point that design director Emil Pagliarulo feels strongly about, as he recently discussed. Speaking to GamesRadar , Pagliarulo explained how he believed the RPGs interweaving questlines—whereby the factions you support affect the choices available to you in the main quest—make it the most replayable Fallout game. Pagliarulo began explaining his position by talking about Fallout 3 . \"The interesting thing about Fallout 3 is there are no faction quests,\" Pagliarulo observed, a fact which separates Bethesda's first stab at Fallout from its Elder Scrolls RPGs. \"For Fallout 4, it was the first time we said, 'You play Skyrim and you play these factions, but they're disconnected from …",

The find was made by a new YouTube channel called Games' Past, and is two gigabytes larger than the release version of New Vegas and filled with cut or altered content that the team has been slowly teasing out. Now there's more. The pair of Xbox 360 devkits that contain the build also have a drive containing early versions, in some cases very early versions, of the New Vegas DLC. The recovered files include PDBs with debug information that's invaluable in reverse-engineering efforts, and now the intrepid explorers have accessed cut content from the expansions, although some of it is far from what would be considered playable. Perhaps the biggest find is in the third DLC, Old World Blues, which has significant differences from the release version, and in particular a room that's restored to former glory. In the release version of Old World Blues there's a VR room that has been wrecked, and has no functionality. Here it works. Kinda.

And by bloody, I actually mean catastrophic: New World announced it'd be closing, Greg Street's MMO had its funding pulled , that ZeniMax game was killed before it could even hit the market, and a Warhammer MMO was cancelled . But World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 survived—which… isn't really any sort of surprise, really. In the world of MMOs, the old guard will always stand strong. It'll take more than a deeply ominous state of the industry (and the fact that no-one seems to get to make MMOs anymore ) to take these big boys down. Yet there's trouble in paradise: In a fascinating bit of coincidence , both World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 are in for a very interesting 2026 (and beyond).

On a personal level, what I wanted from Bloodlines 2 was basically 'Bloodlines 1, but fixed', an RPG that took all the wild, unconstrained ambition of the original and brought it up to modern standards with a new story and exploratory space on top. Yet while Bloodlines 2 had its merits—like its brilliant Malkavian detective companion Fabien—it was mechanically much simpler than Troika's game, while also lacking meaningful side-quests and any real sense of character progression. But if, like me, you're worried that we might never see a truly great vampire RPG, hold that thought. Next year, Rebel Wolves is due to release The Blood of Dawnwalker , and it might just be the vampire RPG we've been waiting for.

It's only three points better than Bride Hard but still miles (20 points) better than the current worst-rated film of the year—War of the Worlds, which from what I have been told is an awful lot of Ice Cube staring at screens peppered in with some not-so-subtle Amazon product placement.

Players created 9,130 missions for chancing mercenaries to take up, while the most popular new ship, the Pioneer, was manufactured 71,873 times, and destroyed 4,513 times. Players across the game also destroyed 12,406 player-made 'upwell' structures, which presumably led to a helluva lot of insurance claims.
