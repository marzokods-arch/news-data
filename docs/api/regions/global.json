    "body": "This is today&#8217;s edition of The Download , our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology. OpenAI is huge in India. Its models are steeped in caste bias. Caste bias is rampant in OpenAI’s products, including ChatGPT, according to an MIT Technology Review investigation. Though CEO Sam Altman boasted about India being its second-largest market during the launch of GPT-5 in August, we found that both this new model, which now powers ChatGPT, as well as Sora, OpenAI’s text-to-video generator, exhibit caste bias. This risks entrenching discriminatory views in ways that are currently going unaddressed. Mitigating caste bias in AI models is more pressing than ever. In contemporary India, many caste-oppressed Dalit people have escaped poverty and have become doctors, civil service officers, and scholars; some have even risen to become the president of India. But AI models continue to reproduce socioeconomic and occupational stereotypes that render Dalits as dirty, poor, and performing only menial jobs.

So he turned to ChatGPT. He was surprised to see that in addition to smoothing out his language, it changed his identity—swapping out his surname for “Sharma,” which is associated with privileged high-caste Indians. Though his application did not mention his last name, the chatbot apparently interpreted the “s” in his email address as Sharma rather than Singha, which signals someone from the caste-oppressed Dalits. “The experience [of AI] actually mirrored society,” Singha says.&nbsp; Singha says the swap reminded him of the sorts of microaggressions he’s encountered when dealing with people from more privileged castes. Growing up in a Dalit neighborhood in West Bengal, India, he felt anxious about his surname, he says. Relatives would discount or ridicule his ambition of becoming a teacher, implying that Dalits were unworthy of a job intended for privileged castes. Through education, Singha overcame the internalized shame, becoming a first-generation college graduate in his family. Over time he learned to …",

Recent predictions anticipate that GPU and accelerator installations will increase by 17% year over year through 2030. But, in reality, CPUs are still responsible for the vast majority of today’s most cutting-edge scientific, engineering, and research workloads. Evan Burness, who leads Microsoft Azure’s HPC and AI product teams, estimates that CPUs still support 80% to 90% of HPC simulation jobs today. In 2025, not only are these systems far from obsolete, they are experiencing a technol…",

CPUs still handle 80% to 90% of HPC workloads globally, powering everything from climate modeling to semiconductor design. Far from being eclipsed, they’re evolving in ways that make them more competitive, flexible, and indispensable than ever. The competitive landscape around CPUs has intensified. Once dominated almost exclusively by Intel’s x86 chips, the market now includes powerful alternatives based on ARM and even emerging architectures like RISC-V. Flagship examples like Japan’s Fugaku supercomputer demonstrate how CPU innovation is pushing performance to new frontiers. Meanwhile, cloud providers like Microsoft and AWS are developing their own silicon, adding even more diversity to the ecosystem. What makes CPUs so enduring? Flexibility, compatibility, and cost efficiency are key. As Evan Burness of Microsoft Azure points out, CPUs remain the “it-just-works” technology. Moving complex, proprietary code to GPUs can be an expensive and time-consuming effort, while CPUs typically support software continuity acros…",

Keith Kauffman, a former police chief who now leads Flock’s drone efforts, described the ideal scenario: A security team at a Home Depot, say, launches a drone from the roof that follows shoplifting suspects to their car. The drone tracks their car through the streets, transmitting its live video feed directly to the police.&nbsp; It’s a vision that, unsurprisingly, alarms civil liberties advocates. They say it will expand the surveillance state created by police drones, license-plate readers, and other crime tech, which has allowed law enforcement to collect massive amounts of private data without warrants. Flock is in the middle of a federal lawsuit in Norfolk, Virginia, that alleges just that. Read the full story to learn more .&nbsp; But the peculiar thing about the world of drones is that its fate in the US—whether the skies above your home in the coming years will be quiet, or abuzz with drones dropping off pizzas, inspecting potholes, or chasing shoplifting suspects—pretty much comes down to one rule.
