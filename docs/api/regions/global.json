The next return is a less-expected one, with The Hobbit double-dipping on Middle-earth after the success of the Lord of the Rings expansion .

    "body": "If you have your eye on the upcoming Asus ROG Xbox Ally X handheld gaming PC, be careful where you buy it from. As reported by Tom's Hardware , scalpers are already trying to rip people off with eBay listings charging over two times MSRP—while the ROG Xbox Ally X is still available for pre-order at its normal price. Tom's Hardware spotted numerous eBay listings for the Xbox Ally X priced as high as $2,500. For context, the MSRP is $999 for the Xbox Ally X or $599 for the base Xbox Ally. Both devices are set to launch on October 16. If you want to snag a Xbox Ally, it's best to avoid eBay entirely. At the time of writing, pre-orders are still open for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X at Best Buy , Asus , and Microsoft (if you're outside the US, you can check the official Xbox pre-order page to find pre-order options in your region). This is a pretty pricey handheld as it is, all things considered, so don't let a scalper trick you into paying double. If you consider the ROG Xbox Ally X part of the Xbox line-up ( which Microsoft seems to ), it's the most expensive Xbox to date. For $1,000, you get an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip, 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a 7-inch FHD IPS display…",

A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything.” Both Final Fantasy 16 and 7: Rebirth underperformed in sales according to a May 2024 internal report that was made public last September. Notably, the report was written before either game got its eventual PC port. FF16 came to PC in September 2024, 15 months after PS5, and Rebirth in January 2025, just under a year out from PS5. Square Enix is one of the only non-first party companies to still do this, and unlike Rockstar, no longer commands the kind of universal, \"drop …",

So, while things might get off to a rocky start, issues will get smoothed out as those ideas are refined. As reported by GamesRadar , in an interview with Edge Magazine, 2XKO director Shaun Rivera commented on Riot's hopes (and fears) for the game, stating, \"We're the type of team where we want to try stuff. Sometimes it's going to land and sometimes it's going to whiff, but we will be trying things. I want to set those expectations for players that something we try might go wrong or it might not be good, but we'll address it.\" Rivera also noted that \"it's going to be a little bumpy when we get out,\" although that's to be expected with any early access game. Even if 2XKO wasn't in early access, though, Rivera makes the case for a little leeway, adding, \"I do want to call out, though, that we're a team of people making a fighting game for the first time in a sense, and we don't have …",

A studio recording was revealed during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, interspersed with some new clips of the game's combat. It's all snarling strings and portentous vocal melodies, and given that it's performed by a live orchestra, it's a level of production value the sidescrolling beat 'em up is treated to less often than I'd like.

Also clock that style meter in the top right; this is a game that takes after Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. The triple threat character setup means you can launch an enemy into the air with one character, switch to another, and send them crashing back down in a matter of seconds. Morbid Metal was slated for an early access launch earlier this year before it got delayed, though there's still a demo you can try on its Steam page .

You'll meet Tea Practitioner Nami, a white cat called Taiko, and a disgruntled fisherman. The gang's all here. You play as a monk who can literally ride the wind, using the clouds as platforms to walk on or skimming across the water gracefully. Meeting a talking cat doesn't seem so farfetched now. We also see more of the poem-making in action. You'll get to craft haikus based on the environment around you. So, when you encounter the fisherman, you can try to cheer him up by choosing from a list of words you've gathered and making the best verse you can think of.

Those things come with so many accessories, and there are hundreds of pet-related items that you'll be able to decorate with. You'll be able to take pets with you while you're fixing up a house, too.

In Dyping Escape, rather than simply selecting conversation options from a drop down box, you have to type out predetermined responses. Sounds easy, but as the trailer in the PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct shows, things quickly unravel. A set of mysterious eyes tells you to play a typing game with it, promising to improve your keyboard clicking speed. Honestly, I could use the help. I pretty much only use the index finger on my right hand to hit the keys, so I could use some practice. However, things take a sinister turn when the eyes get you to type \"Liars must be punished\" and \"I offer you my left eye.\" PSA: Don't offer the weird eyes in your computer your own peepers, that won't go well for you. What follows makes it look as though the eyes are trying to take over your computer, attempting to shut down your CPU, disabling your mouse cursor, and telling you they want to \"take over your empty shell.\" It's like an evil version of Clippy. In the full trailer you can even see it wearing your own left eye, and it creates a very disconcerting effect. I wonder if Dyping Escape is …",

As you can see in the trailer shown during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, swimming about someone's memories in a mind ocean is quite the trippy experience. Colors are vivid, dimensions are distorted, and you'll find bubbles of still memories nestled between huge pillars of seaweed—I wonder if there are any giant fish in the game. As you swim to each memory, you'll find it broken and fragmented. Each has a missing detail that you need to uncover to restore the memory and unlock the past, working out where Lina's missing boyfriend is. From kitchens to bustling bars and busy streets, there's a wide variety of locations for you to comb through.

As shown in the trailer, you can hit record and you'll see afterimages remain behind your little guy, capturing their positions as you move them around. You can then replay that movement, allowing the protagonist to, in the first example, cross a large gap by first recording themselves walk the length of the gap on a flat surface. But that's not all this power is good for. If there's a wall that's too high to jump over but you went up an elevator nearby, just record your motion in there and you'll simply float above the obstacle. I'm sure there are a huge number of platforming puzzles that can be created with a clever system like this. If you're on a spinning platform you can record a circle, or if you do a series of jumps you can dart around obstacles in the air without a care in the world. It seems something like a more tactical version of Super Meat Boy or Celeste (perhaps with less ragequitting). What makes the game shoot even higher up my wishlist is its black and white retro style. …",

With over 50 weapons and some truly absurd moves, this Asian folklore-inspired fantasy RPG has a lot of potential. You can watch the PC Gaming Show trailer above. Rather than traditional RPG leveling, in First Guardian \"runes, items, and crafting are used to strengthen your character,\" which could make it easier to swap between builds than it normally is in a soulslike. I just can't wait to figure out what set of gear I need to pull off the sick dashes and somersault dagger attack we see in the trailer. There's no stamina, so you're free to go on offense as much as you'd like, but for those who prefer a less acrobatic combat style, it seems First Guardian has you covered on that front, too.

Farmbotic is a little like a 3D Stardew Valley, offering a cute, easy-going farming and gathering experience, complete with enemies to slay in mines and dungeons. The twist is that it also throws in co-op and some mechanical elements à la Satisfactory. As you can see in the trailer, there are cute robots that will work the land with you, and also machines you can build and pipes you can connect to help you keep up with all the labor that goes into maintaining a proper farm. It's also got a charming '70s and '90s retro-futuristic style, and gives the bots some sweet bunny ears. Another feature that's just been announced is that Farmbotic will be launching with crossplay, so you won't need to disown any friends who choose to get it on PS5 or Xbox.

Creative director Bryan Wynia kicks off the new gameplay trailer by introducing us to three new weapons that are being added. First up is the Streik Dual Defender Shotgun. This thing packs a serious punch, and we see it sending Zeds flying backwards, cutting them clean in half, or both—often both. If you're worried about only having two shots, don't be! This thing even has a quad barrel attachment, which reminds me of the shotgun in Bulletstorm. Next is the MKR-350 Assault Rifle, which looks awesome when you start modifying it and adding all the attachments. It appears to be a solid all-rounder: real bread and butter weaponry that should be useful just about anywhere. Finally, the M14 EBR MOD 0.

A new trailer for the hectic action platformer dropped at today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, and though the soundtrack sounds a little more metal-inspired than punk, it's got an anarchy gauge, destructible environments, and nine anthropomorphized feline cyberpunks speaking truth to power by chucking oversized weapons at it. It certainly looks the part to match the trailer's tagline: \"scratch, smash, survive.\" Plenty of action games are already out there huffing the graffiti fumes of cyberpunk aesthetics for their retro cool, but what interests me most about Clawpunk is its hero-based setup and card system.

    "body": "While long eclipsed in technology and ambition, 2006's Bully remains one of Rockstar's most distinctive games, and it's certainly the one I'd most like to see the studio take another stab at. Sadly Bully 2 was cancelled way back in 2009 , and given how long it's taken Rockstar to make Grand Theft Auto 6 , it seems unlikely that they'd spare any resources for a Bully sequel. We do, however, have an explanation from Rockstar's cofounder as to why Bully 2 never saw the light of day. Speaking to IGN at LA Comic Con (via Eurogamer ), Dan Houser explained that the project ended prematurely due to a lack of \"bandwidth\" among Rockstar management. \"I think it was just bandwidth issues, Houser told IGN. \"You know, if you've got a small lead creative team and a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want.\" It's a fairly broad explanation, but it falls roughly in line with previously stated reasons for Bully 2's. Back in 2021, former Rockstar New England employees explained that Bully 2 was in development for between one year and eighteen months before Rockstar's management canned the project. Rockstar Founder Dan Houser confirms why BULLY 2 never happened.He bla…",

The trailer for Billie Bust Up, which appeared at today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, shows off the music and platforming in the upcoming animal adventure. You play as Billie, a bunny with magical abilities. Guided by Aristotle, the singing axolotl, you'll master different powers. Billie can fly on a broomstick just like a witch, and can use an umbrella to glide gracefully like Mary Poppins. But that's not all, she can run along walls as though she's the Prince of Persia, and uses an assortment of gadgets to get through each level, like bombs, swords, and some sort of projectile launcher—it looks like the umbrella refashioned to shoot gusts of compressed air. There's still more. Billie can also turn invisible and slide around on water by turning it to ice right as she steps on it. I'm excited to see what kind of platforming challenges will be on offer. Hopefully there will be some where you have to combine multiple movement methods. Now, I don't know about you, but I often find platforming games can have rather dull boss fights that amount to…",

So I was impressed when I saw Awaysis' physics-based slide jumps and enemy-propelling magic projectiles, but I was elated when I saw one player seemingly brush their co-op partner off a ledge and into an endless abyss by accident. Indeed, Awaysis looks like a souped-up classic Zelda but it plays a bit like Gang Beasts or Human Fall Flat in that physics are everything. In its latest trailer, which popped up at today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, there's a detailed look at how ramps, concaves, and half-pipes in the environment cause players to slow down, speed up, and fly to ludicrous heights like they're marbles in a miniature skate park. When the game first debuted , developer 17-bit described both Gang Beasts and pinball as inspirations, but it's a little hard to conceptualize until you see it in action. The new preview offers a taste of the funny friend-killing scenarios, of course, but it also struts how physics-driven combat can reflavor the classic dungeon crawl. You can bat enemies off ledge…",

The swirling snow and howling wind rushing through Moominvalley makes me want to curl up with a blanket and a hot cup of tea. From the developers of Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, this spiritual successor has you playing as Moomintroll himself (for the uninitiated, these are creatures of Finnish storybook origins ). He's woken up early from his winter hibernation, and while looking for someone to help him summon spring, he instead stumbles upon characters that he can lend a helping hand to. One of these is a timid squirrel that Moomintroll finds scurrying about in the attic. As we see during the trailer above, he runs out into the frosty world, following the squirrel's tracks and telling them it's okay to stay inside where it's nice and warm. I love the art style—it looks like you're playing through an old Disney movie like 101 Dalmatians or Bambi. Moomintroll has to shovel snow to clear his path, hide behind boulders to stop the wind blowing him backwards on the ice, and throw snowballs at some scary eyes hiding in the trees and fright…",

It's a lot like Orcs Must Die, only from a top-down perspective. You'll use spikes, ballistas, and even boulders to dispatch the raiders who dare to disturb you. You can lure all your foes into one long corridor and then use linked traps to kick off a chain reaction that finishes them all off in one fell swoop. Or, you can use rotating passages to split them up and watch them get picked off one by one. You don't have to just stand by and watch your mechanical horrors have all the fun, either: You can get stuck in and fight the stragglers. As you play you'll uncover more of his …",
