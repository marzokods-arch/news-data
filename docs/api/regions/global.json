Stoakes then replied to Dave Hansen, kernel hacker at Intel, saying, \"We're noticing a lot more LLM slop than we used to. It is becoming more and more of an issue.\" Stoakes argues LLMs have had a negative impact in many areas, \"for which you need only take a cursory glance at the world to observe\". Furthering this point, Stoakes says, \"Thinking LLMs are 'just another tool' is to say effectively that the kernel is immune from this. Which seems to me a silly position.\" This is where Torvalds comes into the conversation . He says, \"No. Your position is the silly one. There is *zero* point in talking about AI slop. That's just plain stupid. Why? Because the AI slop people aren't going to document their patches as such. That's such an obvious truism that I don't u…",

Embark Studios hasn't confirmed a roadmap for Arc Raiders yet, but there are some things we're very likely to see, at the very least, before 2027 creeps up on us. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Following on from the last few months, I'd bet that raiders will get to experience new map conditions, weapons, arc mobs, raider decks, and hopefully even some new community events. When it comes to map conditions, I wouldn't be surprised if we got a desert condition sometime in the summer, like the Cold Snap , but in reverse. I'd also like to see something like a Wacky Raid, where the arc behaviour is really weird, the mobs spawn in locations you'd usually not find them in, and the loot makes absolutely no sense for where you'd find it. It sounds fun (and horrifying) finding a leaper wedged into the hallways of Dam Control Tower, although that's likely a pipe dream. But you know what isn't? New mobs. From the beginning, pl…",

The Epic Games Store, the Xbox App, Ubisoft Connect, the EA App (why does every publisher have an app?), none of these platforms come anywhere close to matching Steam's generally stellar experience. That being said, a lack of real competition is the root of complacency, and I for one would like to see Steam continue to improve, especially as it invades the living room with its second and much more promising attempt at the Steam Machine . So, I rallied some PC Gamers, we bashed our heads together, and came up with a list of nine things we'd like Steam to add in 2026. More detailed options for Steam reviews Can you guess the game? (Image credit: Steam) Scott Tanner, Senior Video Producer: It’s silly that Steam reviews are distilled into a binary thumbs-up/thumbs-down choice.

There was an immediate and intense reaction as fans wondered what this meant for the studio's future games. Would Divinity be stuffed with AI slop? Would it be built with gen AI trained on artwork of dubious provenance? Eventually, Larian promised a Reddit Q&A session to give players a bit of transparency into the studio, its processes, and how it's using AI. Or how it's not using AI, I guess. As was prophesied, Larian kicked off its Q&A —with Vincke and a load of other studio honchos—earlier today. One key takeaway? Larian's swearing off using gen AI tools in concept art development. \"First off—there is not going to be any gen AI art in Divinity,\" wrote Vincke. \"I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration.

For its part, Warhorse is rather tired of talking about it. The studio told us last year that it was \"fed up\" of being dragged into culture wars and wanted only \"to make a cool videogame,\" but when I got the chance to chat with Martin Klíma, studio co-founder and KCD2 executive producer, about KCD2 taking PCG's 2025 GOTY award , I had to take a second to ask: did he think the controversies actually impacted the series at all, in terms of sales, reception, or developer morale? Klíma said that, really, it was difficult to tell. \"I would really, really like to know the answer to this one,\" he said. \"You can really convincingly argue both ways.

The just possibly good news is that, in a new interview, AMD has left the door ever so slightly ajar for that happening in future. For many, the frustration is that many of these new upscaling features can be made to run on RDNA 3 graphics and indeed, community-based hacks have achieved just that , albeit with mixed results. So why won't AMD give that effort some official support? Speaking with PC World , Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President at AMD and the guy responsible for various driver features, including FSR upscaling technologies, explained that the lack of official support for the latest FSR tech on RDNA 3 basically comes down to the difficulty in delivering a consistent experience. But when asked if there could be \"an opportunity to make a beta version of Redstone that will run on RDNA 3,\" his answer is at least a little promising. \"That's currently not in the plan, but thanks for the hint.

We tend to keep a close eye on Nvidia and AMD for any news about upcoming products, but this year, it was all about AI. I've run the numbers, with a little help from AI-powered transcription, and the mentions of AI are rather staggering. If you thought Nvidia was emperor of AI, think again. The company's presentation was primarily focused on AI and robotics, but it logged a mere 120 mentions of AI during its 91 minute runtime. That's only 1.3 mentions of AI per minute (AI/min). AMD's CES keynote , led by Dr. Lisa Su, hit a staggering 210 mentions of AI. That was over a longer runtime of 117 minutes, though it works out to a much higher 1.8 AI/min. Su really wanted to drive that point home, huh? Now, bear in mind that some Ryzen products have AI in the name. Ryzen AI Max, for example, though only 13 mentions of AI in AMD's show were preceded by the word 'Ryzen'. If you're wondering what percentage of the words spoken were 'AI', and of course you were, here you are: 1.2% of all words spoken during AMD's show were 'AI' 0.95% of all words spoken during Nvidia's show were 'AI' Though neith…",

As helpfully laid out in Yukidama's YouTube video , an EMR tablet is one that uses Electromagnetic Resonance that sends a signal to a tablet, which is then translated by the tablet. It's a quick and responsive bit of technology, but different pen vendors work off different frequencies, which can impact compatibility. The video shows how electromagnetic pencils have coils and capacitors near the tip; a test board picks up that frequency and uses a signal amplifier to send that information to a computer. With an oscilloscope, Yukidama measures the frequency of each pencil as it touches the board, and then that frequency as they press harder. Two different pens register two different frequencies. This project uses a smart array of coils in the tablet itself, making it \"compatible with most commercial pens from different vendors, offeri…",

Now Videocardz claims the chip will be branded \"Intel Core G3 Extreme\" and have the same iGPU as Panther Lake in laptops. That means the Core G3 will get the same 12 Xe3-spec graphics cores as the top-spec Panther Lake chips for laptops. However, the leak claims that some concessions have been made to squeeze Panther Lake into the handheld form factor. On the iGPU side, it's said that clock speeds have been reduced from the 2.5 GHz of laptop chips like the Core Ultra X9 388H to 2.3 GHz. No doubt the idea is to reduce power consumption without noticeably impacting frame rates. That slight reduction in clock speed has apparently been enough to have Intel rebrand the iGPU from Intel Arc B390 in the top laptop variants of Panther Lake to Intel Arc B380 for the Intel Core G3 Extreme. As for the CPU of the Panther Lake package, that's had a bit more of a haircut. The full-spec Panther Lake configuration in the aforementioned Core Ultra X9 388H has four Performance cores, eight Efficient cores and four Low Power Efficient cores. …",

However, there was something about the tenor of CES 2026's tidal wave of AI announcements that really got under my skin—namely, many of the exhibitors seem to have forgotten the 'consumer' part of this electronics tradeshow. CES 2026 (Image credit: Future) Catch up with CES 2026 : We're on the ground in sunny Las Vegas covering all the latest announcements from some of the biggest names in tech, including Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Razer, MSI and more. Now, I know it wasn't AI all the way down. There was still plenty of delightful CES weirdness in the form InWin's fresh signature chassis that looks not unlike a futuristic glass egg , as well as yet another rollable laptop concept machine from Lenovo . I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention at least one questionable consumer doo-dad too, such as Lollipopstar , a lollipop that attempts to turn \"candy into a concert in your mouth.\" No, I will not be elaborating further. But, even setting aside the hours our poor Andy spent locked inside Lenovo's AI sphere of despair , a number of exhibitors at this year's CES focussed on AI.

Researcher and developer Jenny Guanni Qu recently looked at the Linux kernel's bug fixes and found tons of them stick around for a very long time. As someone who feels the allure of Linux distributions and occasionally succumbs to it before quickly scarpering back to Windows when confronted with bugs—usually small and irksome ones, but occasionally catastrophic —this information does not help me. So if you're the same as me: you're welcome. Qu built a tool to filter through Linux kernel changes and used it to filter for every fix since 2005. \"Six hours later, I had 125,183 vulnerability records.\" Looking at these fixes, she found that the average lifetime of a bug, ie, a bug existing and potentially causing problems for users, was 2.1 years over the 20-year time frame.

And while that DLC remains firmly in the realm of hopes and dreams for now, with a new year now upon us I am here to tell you that the foundation for that rumor has grown somewhat stronger. There are two big reasons for this. The first comes from IGN Poland , which said earlier this week ( Google translated ) that it first heard about this new expansion, \"from someone who has repeatedly provided us with reliable insider information,\" years ago. IGN Poland said it didn't publish anything about it at the time because the information all came from a single source (that's how actual journalism works), but in light of these new rumors it's opted to make the story public. IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could succ…",

This includes updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans, as well as applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the 'out of map' glitch. Furthermore, we are introducing tools for streamers to help mitigate stream sniping.\" While it's important and good that Embark reinforces its anti-cheat priorities early on, it's arriving on the heels of a wildfire of unrest that's outsized its true impact over the last few days. Streamers have been quick to declare that Arc Raiders is already \" killing its potential ,\" but the truth is that the average player is unlikely to regularly run into wallhackers while casually scavenging for springs, especial…",

The half-season-long celebration coincides with the Amazon show's second season with operator skins for the main cast, themed modes, and a special Vault-Tec Nuketown makeover. In the months before Black Ops 7's release, Activision addressed growing unrest with Black Ops 6's cosmetic output—which included particularly gaudy Beavis and Butthead and American Dad partnerships—by promising that Black Ops 7 would be different. \"We know there’s been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty.

To me, that was Fallout. So, that was the first thing, the first asset. The next iconic thing was the Pip-Boy. It's kind of an abstracted thing in the early games.

Asus has partnered with boutique headphone manufacturer Hifiman to bring planar magnetic drivers to its new gaming headset, the Asus ROG Kithara . For those not in the know, planar magnetic drivers use a magnet-suspended diaphragm to deliver exceptionally crisp and accurate audio, which makes them highly-prized among audiophiles. Our best audiophile headphones pick, the Audeze Maxwell , uses a similar pair—but it looks like there's some new competition in town. I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows. Watching a clip of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay, the impact sounds were pretty jawbone-rumbling. The open-backed wired set was plugged in to a substantial DAC/amplifier combo, so they were obviously being pushed quite heavily, but boy did it make for some serious air movement.

This new gaming monitor has so much going for it. It gets LG's latest OLED panel tech (albeit minus the RGB-stripe subpixel layout ) and a 5K2K native resolution. That's 5,120 by 2,160 pixels. It's basically a 4K 16:9 pixel grid taken out to 21:9 aspect ultrawide. More specifically, it's essentially a 32-inch 16:9 monitor stretched out to 21:9. That means the 140-ish DPI pixel density is the same as a 32-inch 4K panel. Personally, when it comes to the best compromise between crispy precision for day-to-day computing and maybe creative workflows, overall panel size for immersion and tolerable GPU load for gaming, 32-inch 4K makes more sense than 27-inch 4K. The latter has better pixel density, for sure. But that's barely noticeable for games, and yet you will feel the smaller, less immersive panel size.

That's pretty early, at least in my part of the world, but bear in mind that Larian is not based in my part of the world but in Ghent, Belgium, where the whole thing can go down after a nice extended lunch. If you're wondering what this is all about, a quick refresher: Larian unveiled Divinity , its next game, at The Game Awards 2025 with a shockingly dark, brutal trailer that reminded us all that Baldur's Gate 3 got rolling the same way before all the, y'know, sex . But the studio's big moment went awry just days later when Vincke said in a Bloomberg interview that Larian was experimenting with generative AI in the early stages of game development, and that developers at the studio were happy about it. This did not go over well with a significant portion of Larian's fan base, and suddenly Good Guy Swen was being portrayed as just another o…",

While it'd be hard to think of a Fallout game without VATS underlying it, linking gunplay to the classic RPG elements of its predecessors, Fallout 3—the first Fallout game after Bethesda acquired the licence—almost threw the gunplay out with the… uh, gunwater. I've lost track of this metaphor. That's per an interview in the latest issue of Edge (thanks, Gamesradar ).

As it's January, we're also going to start hearing about how big tech fared financially during the final quarter of 2025—and obviously, many of these massive corporations are doing far better than anyone who just wants a reasonably priced upgrade for their gaming PC. Case in point, Samsung Electronics is already estimating that its final quarter operating profits for 2025 is about \" 20 trillion Korean won .\" That's well over 13 billion USD or 10 billion GBP—and almost threefold what Samsung made during 2024's fourth quarter. There is a bit more nuance to be gleaned beyond that eye-watering figure, though. To begin with, Samsung's full earnings guidance offers the estimated range of \"19.9 trillion to 20.1 trillion Korean won\" for operating profits and \"92 trillion to 94 trillion Korean won\" for sales. Yeah, okay, that is still a lot of won. The guidance goes on to note that only offering ranges doesn't square with Korean disclosure regulations, hence the '20 trillion Korean won' figure. Samsung explains this represents \"the median of the estimate ranges.\" That said, both ends of these ranges still…",

AndaSeat's Kaiser 3E XL comes in at a lower price than Secretlab's Titan Evo XL, and if you are less than 5' 11” (180 cm) tall you can save a further sliver of cash by getting the merely ‘large' version. The overall look of the chair—with its striking cutouts and a logo-emblazoned backrest that wishes it could appear on camera illuminated by some streamer's ringlight—is definitely gamer-centric.

Question, will that tech appear in a PC monitor any time soon? The answer is yes and no. Yes, the technologies seen in the new panels are headed for PC monitors. But, no, you can't expect to see PC monitors anything like that bright. One useful reference point here is that existing TV OLED panels are already rated at up 4,000 nits, with these new-gen OLEDs bumping that up to 4,500 nits. Existing OLED monitors, meanwhile, get nowhere 4,000 nits, typically topping out at 1,300 nits. So, OLED monitors based on a given equivalent generation of panel technology are much less bright on the desktop than their TV compatriots. We'll come back to the reasons why, but let's just cover off what the two big panel makers announced at CES this year. Samsung's latest QD-OLED panels aren't a radical departure. The emissive material is revised rather than a fully new generation. All told, Samsung is claiming 4,500 nits peak HDR brightness for small screen areas with 450 nits full-screen brightness.

It's on the crafting and upgrades side. I hate inventory management and Arc Raiders is particularly bad at it: You're constantly bottlenecked on upgrades by a shortage of some items, while at the same time having an overabundance of other things you may or may not need later. Yes, it's deliberate and by design. But other extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov, despite being on a different level of brutality than Arc Raiders, at least have a player economy where you can fudge through some of the worst by selling and buying. Despite Arc Raiders being quite happy to connect players in-game, there's no means to swap or sell key items in order to get the stuff you really need.

(Image credit: Embark Studios) \"What I like about the game and what I think is interesting is how people are playing the game,\" Embark Studios CEO, Patrick Söderlund, says in an interview with GamesBeat . \"I read an article the other day about how this game is almost like a social experiment. \"The social aspect of how this game is played and the interactions people have in the game and what stories the players tell, that I think is where the glue sits, that is at least why it is a…",

We've seen classified locations , some old-school Fallout spots , and finally found out one of Fallout's oldest mysteries . But the episode brings something better: Deathclaws. Fans of the games have been waiting to see a Deathclaw in the series since the first episode aired, and even though we didn't even get a whiff of one in the first season, there was a small teaser in the post-credits scene as we saw a Deathclaw skull on the road to New Vegas. (Image credit: Prime Video) \"We didn't do Deathclaws in season 1,\" Todd Howard tells me. \"We wanted to make sure we'd spend the right amount of time to get them right.
