(It probably also helped that I was no longer 13 years old.) But something was lost when RPGs became blockbusters rather than adaptations of pen-and-paper games, and The Outer Worlds 2 game director Brandon Adler is happy to see RPGs like Baldur's Gate 3 force players to pay more attention to their build choices and the game world. \"In general, it feels like many games, but RPGs in particular, are like, 'Well, you're not allowed to make bad choices, so every character build is viable, and we make sure that no matter what you do, everything's going to be fine,'\" Adler told GamesRadar+ in a recent interview. \"And you know, the problem with that, at least in my opinion, is that for those choices to matter, they have to be things that could be good or bad, depending on what you're doing.\" Adler recounted watching streamers m…",

Its next season will make sweeping changes to how monsters fight back and how players customize their gear, and there's even more reworks coming in its next expansion. A big question that has come up as the game transforms yet again, is how often this is going to happen, and if it will continue for the foreseeable future. Speaking in an interview with Diablo streamer Raxxanterax , associate game director Zaven Haroutunian touched on this concern. \"The intention is not to replace everything just because we can,\" he said. Instead, the team tries to get a \"holistic picture of the whole game,\" and look at \"what is not pulling its weight, what is not helping support the player experience in a positive way.\" Haroutunian says monster types were one of the things that went untouched since the game launched and that they needed to be redone before a dungeon with leaderboards could be added. The Tower dungeon coming in the next season relies on the new monster types to gauge your completion progress, encouraging you to seek out tougher enemies for more points—something that just wouldn't work wit…",

After that, it'll be a still-quite-reasonable 80% off. You can also get Marvel's Midnight Suns for 85% off and finally understand why it was our runner-up for Game of the Year in 2022 . (The answer is: because it was ace, and anyone who complained about how it lets you spend hours hanging out and becoming best buds with Wolverine and Magik is a goose.) Civilization 7 is currently 35% off if you want to dive into the latest in the series, and once you do you can grab the Tides of Power Collection DLC , which is available for free until January 5. Though Civilization 6 is 90% off if you haven't tried the previous entry, and I still have a lot of add-ons for Civ 5 to collect. Oh look, Brave New World is 75% off . If you want to go back even further, Civ 4's Complete Edition is 80% off , and ye olde Sid Meier games are being discounted too. If for some reason you haven't played it yet, Sid Meier's Pirates! is 75% off , and so are the …",

Blueprints are one of the rarest drops in Arc Raiders , as they unlock the ability to craft weapons permanently instead of waiting for them to show up in the shop. The Anvil is a great blueprint to secure early on thanks to the gun's high damage and its Arc armor-penetrating heavy ammo. It's like carrying a pocket Ferro that you don't have to reload after every shot. Because blueprint spawns are somewhat random, there's no surefire place to get an Anvil blueprint. There are, however, raider containers that have a high chance of containing weapon blueprints. Thanks to the investigative work of the community, these caches can be tracked down with consistency. Where I found the Anvil blueprint I found the Anvil blueprint in a convenient hidey hole on Dam Battlegrounds that seems to always spawn raider containers. The raider cache spawns in a gap under where the raised highway on Dam Battlegrounds ends. The spot is between Raider Outpost East and East Broken Bridge.

No amount of editorials about why Telltale mattered could bring those games back. Which is why it's a pleasant surprise to see that Dispatch has done so well. Its developer, Adhoc Studio, just posted that it's sold over a million copies in 10 days , and it's not even done yet, with the final two episodes of its six-episode run due out on Wednesday at 9 am PST.

Now it seems to have at least partially moved on from that ambition, and one big consequence is the end of historical-fantasy MMO New World, which will cease to receive updates and eventually be put to rest. Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: Put off installing Arc Raiders, but was finally convinced to take the plunge by those cool leaping bug bots . What's maddening is that New World itself was not a failure. It was a beneficiary of the early pandemic boom in online gaming, hitting a wild Steam concurrents peak of 913,634 after it launched in 2021. The MMO settled into much lower numbers by early 2022, but was far from a flop, and got an expansion in 2023 and a console port in 2024. New World presumably hasn't been raking in microtransaction cash recently, but when so many MMOs never even make it out of development or blow up on the launch pad, it was at least something : a foothold in an extremely hard-to-break-into space that coul…",

Much of the experience in its early hours is cautiously sussing out where to find good loot and how and when to fight or avoid the Arc robots that patrol the surface. The tentative peaceful relationships formed with other raiders are just as key. The ambiguity of not knowing what they'll do feeds into the tension and uncertainty that keeps expeditions exciting. That's the overarching vibe, at least. But there are other things Arc Raiders makes abundantly clear. For instance: the Leaper. Embark Studios could have named this four-legged, spidery walking robot, one of the first truly serious threats you'll encounter on the surface, anything. Marauder. Devastator. Wriggler. Chuckles. I assume the studio went with Leaper because it did not need to get fancy to make these particular robots seem imposing. All Embark's writers needed to do was imagine what someone would shout after seeing a robot the size of a winnebago jump the length of a football field to pulp their friend who just made a little too much noise prying open a rusty dumpster.

S. Anderson since the late 2000s when he'd become a fan of the series. And the particular point he got into the wonderful world of Monster Hunting seems to have had a huge influence on the movie's slightly odd setup, whereby the focus is on a US / UN military team that gets sucked into the world of Monster Hunter and oo-rahs through various encounters (with limited success).

It's on the outskirts of the Buried City rather than the highly contested centre of the town, it's close to a Raider Hatch and a subway station for fast exfil, and it doesn't require a key, or fighting past a load of Arc enemies to access it. A little oasis in the apocalypse. Weirdly, all you have to do is breach a single door and step into a small room with four lootable containers. The loot spot is behind a breachable door on the north side of the platform at Marano Station (Image credit: Embark Studios) So where is this golden loot spot: Marano Station .

Demonstrating his utter wrongness yet again is the Emulated Vintage Gaming YouTube channel, which recently posted a 10 hour long video of a lore-accurate recreation of Frodo's epic journey from Bag End to Mordor in Lord of the Rings Online . 'Frodo walks from the Shire to Mordor,' as it's called, is not as dramatic or exciting as Peter Jackson's famed film trilogy: It is literally a recording of Frodo walking— walking , take note, not running, although he does get to ride here and there when the books say so—along the route originally followed by the Fellowship. At various spots along the way, Andy Serkis chimes in to describe the scene via audio clips taken from the Lord of the Rings audiobooks, which as chosen line up remarkably well with the events happening on screen. But even though it lacks the cinematic oomph of an Oscar-winning Hollywood film trilogy, the video is an undeniably impressive undertaking, and I dropped a line to EVG to ask what inspired him to do such a thing. \"Escapism, mainly,\" the channel owner, who asked to go unnamed, replied. \"Like anyone …",

Dwarves, meanwhile, received new toys to stem the tide of besieging goblins, like autocrossbow turret emplacements and metal-fortified walls. Overnight, the fantasy settlement sim has rewritten decades of player defensive strategy. One of the interesting complications added by the Siege Update, however, is an unintentional one. Shortly after the update went live, players started reporting on the Kitfox Games Discord that, inexplicably, dwarves in their forts were dying of starvation and dehydration. And not just any dwarves: The moms were refusing to eat, and their babies were the culprit. (Image credit: Kitfox Games) The problem, you see, is that moms are like horses—in Dwarf Fortress, at least. In DF, mothers always hold their newborn babies until the infants reach an age where they can walk, play, and feed themselves. To achieve that, the game actually uses the same systems that let soldiers ride war mounts: While we're shown a dwarven mo…",

It's not the only multiplayer game boasting huge player counts at the moment, either. Battlefield 6 managed a massive 747,000 concurrent players earlier in the month, off the back of a mostly-well-received launch. Of course, there's no one single reason why both of these games attracted so many players to their respective worlds. Battlefield 6 is the latest entry in a long and storied series, whereas Arc Raiders has taken the extraction shooter formula and refined it down to an easy to learn, hard to master point, to name just two.

It seems OpenAI didn't quite get this memo, as it's being accused of infringing copyright. Shueisha recently put out a statement aimed at OpenAI , and specifically its Sora 2 video generator. At the end of September, we got a glimpse of Sora 2, and one of the first viral posts from this tool was deemed \" Temu Blue Exorcist \", which is a reference to another manga published by Shueisha. This isn't the first time OpenAI's AI generation tools were used to ape anime and manga, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even sharing a picture of himself in Studio Ghibli style . As of the time of writing, Altman's profile picture on X is still in Ghibli style. That statement says (machine translated): \"These videos, which infringe on copyrights for anime and characters, were generated using AI learning. Advances in generative AI should be wel…",

The question is, of course, at what point does lower latency become undetectable to human senses? According to MCHOSE itself, the 16 kHz version of the Ace 68 Turbo only improves latency over the (presumably cheaper) 8 KHz variant by 0.02 ms, with the Turbo sitting at 0.06 ms rather than 0.08 ms. So, we are talking about hundredths of a millisecond. Can anyone actually feel that? Cue an army of twitch gamers pointing out the huge benefits of 8 kHz mice and how they couldn't possibly slum it with—eugh!—a 4 KHz rodent. Or whatever. Likewise, it wasn't that long ago that the idea of a, say, 500 Hz monitor seemed a bit silly. Surely anything beyond about 240 Hz was beyond human perception? Well, that no longer seems to be the case. And yet, I'd still take some convincing that there's real-world benefit in a 16 kHz keeb.…",

And if that's the case, it raises the question as to how Amazon is going to cope now that it's signed a $38 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI to give the company access to its servers. It was Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, who made the point about insufficient power in a 70-minute interview (via Tom's Hardware ) with YouTube channel Bg2 Pod, alongside OpenAI's boss, Sam Altman. It came about when the interview's host, Brad Gerstner, mentioned that Nvidia's Jen-Hsun Huang had said that there was almost zero chance of there being a 'compute glut' within the next couple of years (and by that, he means an excess of AI GPUs). \"The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it’s power,\" replied Nadella. \"It’s sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power.

Internet Archive might be most well known for its website archiver, The Wayback Machine, but, in 2020, its Open Library was sued by four major book publishers. Effectively, the Open Library is a digital library, where the Internet Archive would 'loan' digital versions of physical books it owns, to emulate a library. These books would be lent at a 1-1 rate with what it owned. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it created the National Emergency Library in response to libraries shutting down, which removed its prior lending restrictions. In June last year , Hatchet, HarperCollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House won their suit against Internet Archive's Open Library, taking out 500,000 books from the library.

But just occasionally something lands on your desk that's genuinely surprising. And the Abxylute 3D One , a new glasses-free 3D handheld gaming PC, is just such a device. But maybe for all the wrong reasons. We'll have a full review in due course. However, the literal out-of-the-box experience with this Kickstarter-funded device is worth a few immediate impressions. This handheld is extraordinary by several measures. First up, it's absolutely massive. The screen is 11 inches. But it comes with a centimetre-plus of bezel all round, plus a pair of huge clip-on controllers. The upshot of which is that the Abxylute 3D One pretty much dwarfs the laptop on which I'm typing these words. It's so big I have serious reservations about how realistic it is as an actual handheld device. I'm not sure I'd want to game with this beast in my actual hands for very long. Moreover, the comparison between gaming handhelds and gaming laptops is often unflattering, in performance terms, for the former. But the idea is that in return for compromised performance, handhelds give …",

Beating them all for sheer out-of-this-world coolness, though, is Doom on a satellite, orbiting the Earth. Well, it was . The European Space Agency (ESA) deorbited its OPS-SAT device back in May 2024, but before it was turned into dust motes, Georges Labrèche (engineering manager at ESA) contacted Ólafur Waage, a Norwegian software engineer , to see if he fancied a little challenge. Waage is no random coder, though, as he's a highly experienced game developer , working for Massive Entertainment—makers of Far Cry 6, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, and countless others. The challenge was simple on paper: port Doom to run on OPS-SAT. This satellite was an experiment by the ESA, which could be used by members of the public directly over the Internet. Essentially, if your access was approved, you could upload code to the little satellite (just 10 x 10 x 30 cm in size) and have it do stuff for science. Of course, there's…",

Well, EA is trying to allay some of those fears (via Polygon ). In a new FAQ for employees from October 30, the company promised that it was still \"in a strong financial position\" despite the small matter of $20 billion in debt and that it will \"maintain creative control\" over its projects even in its new era of private ownership. It also promises to maintain \"a thoughtful, steady approach to AI,\" after stories circulated about the new owners planning to make heavy use of the tech . What does that mean in practice?

When you're back in Speranza, just open up your inventory and you'll see the option to the right of the category filter.

By nature of it being an extraction shooter, however, it's not a matter of simply equipping the best gun in your loadout and venturing out topside. No, you'll have to find, craft, or buy higher-quality weapons. That takes time, and you can always lose them in a matter of seconds. With that in mind, below, I'll recommend the best weapons for each 'stage' of Arc Raiders, beginning with the strongest cheap weapons, and moving all the way up to the rarest, which aren't necessarily the best in all situations. Generally, if you lose a shootout against other players, it's probably more so down to your strategy and positioning than your gear, as most high-end guns are designed to improve versatility or handling over pure DPS.

It's not just the power of the Zen architecture that makes them so good; it's the use of chiplets, 3D V-Cache, and how they're all connected that makes them the best CPUs around . However, a technology licensing firm is now claiming that AMD's designs have been achieved thanks to its patented ideas, and it's suing the chip giant for \"its extensive and unauthorized use of [the firm's] semiconductor portfolio.\" The company in question is Adeia, and it announced the lawsuits in a recent press release . Technology licensing isn't something new, of course, and it's been around for as long as chips have. The same is true of intellectual property (IP) lawsuits, but there are a few things that make this move more newsworthy than others. Adeia is claiming that \"AMD infringes ten patents from Adeia's semiconductor intellectual property (IP) portfolio—seven patents covering hybrid bonding technology and three patents covering advanced process node technology.\" An example of one such patent can be read here , filed in 2018 and granted in 2020.…",

While I haven't delved as deeply as Morgan, I've likewise been bedazzled by its sumptuous survival adventure through a vast underground facility and branching pocket dimensions. Following the 1.0 launch, Deep Field Games could easily have clocked out from their years-long shift at the GATE Cascade Research Facility. Instead, they've been burning the midnight oil, supplementing their energy with cans of sugary Pop Snarkle and nourishing alien soup. The result is a beefy new update for Abiotic Factor that adds whole new ways to enjoy and/or suffer through its Half-Life-inspired science maze. Primarily, the 1.1 update adds two new modes—Hardcore mode and Iron mode. Hardcore Mode is, frankly, ridiculous, forcing Abiotic Factor's 'Apocalyptic' difficulty setting with the added challenge of losing everything if you die. Progress can be reset by server admins should they deem it necessary, but Deep Field stresses \"that is the cowar…",

But you can also add new, horrifying mobs to the game, different animations, and a number of new blocks created by other players which all alter the core Minecraft experience in one way or another. However, the most popular add-on currently available on the Marketplace doesn't add terrors or a huge variety of wildlife to the game. Instead, it focuses on one thing and one thing only: owls . Obviously everyone loves Minecraft's existing mob selection, but I can't lie, I do find myself getting a bit bored of seeing nothing but pigs, chickens, cows, and sheep. That said, I still get incredibly excited on the odd occasion I stumble across a fox, so I can understand why so many people have jumped at the opportunity to add an all-new creature to the game.

But what is the most satisfying weapon in gaming history? That's an interesting question, and one that when asked by Apogee Entertainment's X account, was answered by none other than the grandfather of FPS games, John Romero, he of Doom fame. Super Shotgun. https://t.co/TikpaEHwhr November 3, 2025 Romero's response was the objectively correct one in my opinion, too, with Romero voting for the 'Super Shotgun', as introduced to gaming originally in Doom 2. Many other gamers agreed with the FPS legend, with comments replying with sentiments such as, 'Agreed! Double barrel in Doom 2', as well as 'it's a scientific fact' and 'it's the Super Shotgun for me too'. One reply simply states, 'I strongly agree, Mr Romero'. How polite.
