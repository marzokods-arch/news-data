A spokesperson for the Reiner family confirmed the deaths Sunday evening. “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.” Emergency responders from the Los Angeles Fire Department arrived around 3:30-3:40 p.m. PT to the Chadbourne Avenue property following a medical aid call, discovering a 78-year-old man and a 68-year-old woman deceased with stab wounds. The LAPD&#8217;s Robbery-Homicide Division is investigating, with no suspect identified or detained as of Sunday evening; no signs of forced entry were reported “We are not looking for anyone as a suspect or in any other manner right now,” Hamilton said, adding that police will not release further details until the Los Angeles County coroner completes formal identification and investigators gather additional evidence.

Reiner and his wife, Michele , were found dead Sunday, Dec. 14, at their Brentwood home in Los Angeles). Oasis ’s Noel and Liam Gallagher aren’t this year’s only long-anticipated musical reconciliation. As Spinal Tap II: The End Continues opens, it’s revealed that Spinal Tap bandmates Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) have been estranged for 15 years. While not actual blood brothers like the Gallaghers, the two musicians grew up together in England and had been pals since they were five. The fortuitous timing is, of course, completely coincidental, Spinal Tap II director Rob Reiner notes, but he still gets a kick out of “life imitating art imitating life,” he says over a Zoom interview, sporting a Spinal Tap baseball cap and t-shirt. “In Oasis’ case, they’re real brothers, but with Spinal Tap, the two guys were best friends since they were little and break apart and come back together.”&nbsp; The movie opens in theaters nationwide Friday (Sept. 12).

Their ascent from a tight-knit group of high school classmates in Baguio City to becoming the Philippines’ number one band feels like the kind of career arc reserved for fiction. Yet here they are: the year’s most streamed local act who sold out the Araneta Coliseum not just once, but five times — and creators of a phenomenon called “ Multo ,” which dominated the Billboard Philippines Hot 100 for 27 straight weeks and continues to rule the Billboard Philippines Top Philippine Songs chart for 35 weeks and counting. And at the inaugural Filipino Music Awards last October, the group sealed their place in modern OPM history, taking home song of the year for “Multo” and album of the year for Silakbo . For a band that started in classrooms and lunch breaks, the scale of their success still feels surreal. “Sobrang (very) unexpected,” vocalist Gian Bernardino says when asked how it feels to hold records that even legacy acts would envy. “Kasi if we talk about how we began, it&#8217;s a very, very one-in-a-million chance na mangyari sa amin ‘yun, kasi nga (that this would happen to us, because) we started th…",

Billboard chart-topping Grammy winners Shaggy and Sean Paul delivered career-spanning hit medleys, new-gen dancehall star Teejay proved the timelessness of his signature hit &ldquo;Drift,&rdquo; and reggae giants like Marcia Griffiths and Gramps Morgan kept soul at the center of it all. Dancehall star I-Octane even leapt into the stands to get up close and personal with some lucky audience members.

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic &#8212; for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us.

All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.)

She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year.

For a second there, Samsung had all of us fooled with dreams of a refreshed line-up consisting of a new Galaxy S26 Pro, an Edge, and an Ultra, which would’ve been a nice departure from its traditional S, S Plus, and S Ultra plans. Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android is getting a quality-of-life update that automatically turns on wireless debugging when connected to trusted Wi-Fi networks. Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

I find foldables to be the ultimate productivity boosters . Not only does the extra real estate on the inner screen allow more content to be viewed at once, which can be helpful for reading, but it also serves what would typically require two screens. Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature.

It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",

They occur around the planet, most often in autumn and winter, with the U.S. West Coast typically affected by moist air that originates near Hawaii. In this event, however, some of the moisture arrived from even farther away, originating roughly 7,000 miles (11,000 kilometers) across the Pacific from near the Philippines . This map shows the total precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere at 11:30 p.m. P…",

The spokesperson states that an optimization was identified and that the rollout across all devices is “progressing as planned.” Nothing OS 4.0 began rolling out to the Phone 3 on November 21 and days later to the Phone 2, Phone 2a, Phone 2a Plus, Phone 3a, and Phone 3a Pro. Despite the rollout starting last month, many Nothing Phone owners claim that they have yet to receive the Android 16 skin. After a screenshot of an exchange with Nothing’s support team was shared online, it was believed that the update had been pulled . Now Nothing has offered an official statement on the status of the rollout. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Like a toddler, our Sun occasionally has disruptive outbursts. But instead of throwing a fit, the Sun spews magnetized material and hazardous high-energy particles that drive space weather as they travel across the solar system. These outbursts can impact our daily lives, from disrupting technologies like GPS to triggering power outages, and they can also imperil voyaging astronauts and spacecraft. Understanding how these solar outbursts, called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), occur and where they are headed is essential to predicting and preparing for their impacts at Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Images taken by Parker Solar Probe in December 2024, and published Thursday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters , have revealed that not all magnetic material in a CME escapes the Sun — some makes it back, changing the shape of the solar atmosphere in subt…",

    "body": "TL;DR Enabling App Continuity on the Galaxy Z TriFold causes the device to lower the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen. Samsung lowers the cover screen’s rendering resolution to match the inner screen’s pixel density so apps don’t restart when unfolding. A hardware upscaler keeps the display looking sharp, but screenshots capture the raw, lower-resolution image before it is processed. Like most foldable phones , the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold sports two displays: an outer cover screen and an inner main screen. What makes the TriFold unique is that its inner screen folds twice, giving the device its signature look. In most other respects, though, the TriFold behaves like any other Samsung foldable. It supports App Continuity, for example, allowing you to seamlessly transition apps from the cover to the main screen. However, this feature causes an interesting quirk on the TriFold: it compromises the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen — but for good reason.

    "body": "TL;DR Amazon will allow EPUB and PDF downloads for DRM-free Kindle books starting January 20, 2026. The change follows Amazon’s removal of the long-standing USB download option in 2025. Only titles where the publisher opts out of DRM will qualify, so most Kindle books still won’t be downloadable. Amazon is bringing back something Kindle fans didn’t expect to see again: direct downloads. Starting January 20, 2026, anyone who buys a qualifying DRM-free title will be able to download an EPUB or PDF version from their Amazon account. The change was quietly announced in Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing documentation , and it marks the first time in years that the company has offered a sanctioned path to download Kindle content outside its walled garden. It’s also a sharp contrast to Amazon’s decision in early 2025 to remove the long-standing Download &amp; Transfer via USB option, a shift that did not go over well with the brand’s power users.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR The latest Google Play Books &amp; Audiobooks beta reveals code pointing to an upcoming “Ask Gemini” feature. “Ask Gemini” will allow users to select text in a book and request AI-driven insights or summaries directly. It remains unclear whether the Gemini experience will run within the app or redirect users externally to the Gemini app. Gemini started off slow, but Google has made great progress in making the AI digital assistant actually useful. The reception from consumers is just as great, and it makes sense that Google would want all of its products to benefit from it . We’ve now spotted hints that Gemini could soon be coming to the Google Play Books &amp; Audiobooks app. Given how useful adding Gemini to a Kindle can be, adding Gemini to the Play Books app could change how people read books within Google’s ecosystem.

But therein lies an issue with today’s Android updates. If you ask me in a few years what the differences are between Android 16, Android 16 QPR1, and Android 16 QPR2, I’m not certain if I’d be able to tell you.
