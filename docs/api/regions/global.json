    "body": "Sniper rifles in Borderlands 4 aren't my cup of tea, but like the similarly definition-breaking Katagawa's Revenge sniper, the Complex Root is simply too good to ignore. This legendary sniper shoots a slow-moving mesh of…energy bolts? It's a barrage of projectiles that twist and turn as it moves, giving it the potential to hit larger enemies multiple times with a single shot. While it's a toss-up which one's better for your build, there is one clear advantage the Complex Root has over the Katagawa's Revenge: you can start farming for the Complex Root shortly after leaving the comfort of the Launchpad. How to get Complex Root in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get Compex Root from the Mimicron boss at the end of the Tipping Point Order bunker to the southeast of Idolator's Noose, Fadefields. In fact, it's near the coast just east of Sol's Fortress Indomita and Wyclef's Reprieve safehouse, so it's easy to access and return to for farming. Like all Order bunkers (such as the one hiding the Hot Slugger ), you need to find the bio canister to crack open the bunker door, and Tipping Poin…",

Firing either a volley of lightning turrets or exploding fire orbs, this legendary is only a sniper in name, as you barely even need to aim to inflict heavy damage. Unfortunately, getting Katagawa's Revenge requires quite a bit of legwork, especially when compared to the likes of the Complex Root . You'll not only need to progress the story into Carcadia Burn, but you'll basically need to finish this region's arc (thanks to Zane's inclusion, it's one of the best, though).

It's still unmatched as an MMORPG, and I desperately want a spiritual successor. So know that it is with no malice that I say that Ship of Heroes has left me completely and utterly baffled. First announced back in 2016 , Ship of Heroes has spent the last nine years somewhat struggling. It was intended as a spiritual successor to City of Heroes, carrying on the torch of the shut-down MMORPG—this was before private servers burst out of the woodwork after years of hiding in 2019 . It's set on a giant, metropolis-sized spaceship, hence the name, and has a lot of the same hallmarks—archetypes with primary and secondary powersets, augments you can slot in 'em, and so on. Unfortunately, a cancelled kickstarter only saw around £26,000 of a £297,114 goal reached in 2017. Nonetheless, its developers have admirably continued development, to the point where it was actually released this week. Now, …",

But the launch turned a less-than-flattering spotlight on another recent Payday 2 development: A significant increase in the price of the Infamous Collection, a bundle of all current Payday 2 DLC that players can buy outright. A few weeks before the launch of the subscription service, the Infamous Collection jumped from $118 to $170, a steep increase that many players assumed was meant to funnel them toward the subscription service. Gustav Nisser, Starbreeze's head of commercial, said there was no connection—that the timing was simply \"unfortunate,\" and the studio had \"dropped the ball\" on keeping fans in the loop. Payday fans, it's fair to say, weren't convinced, and now Starbreeze has decided to walk the whole thing back: The original bundle discount has been restored. \"The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch—and they're not wrong, it's terrible timing,\" Nisser told PC Gamer. \"We definitely didn't handle this righ…",

In less than 24 hours the project was fully funded and met its first two stretch goals: adding fishing, and a group of sentient fruits and vegetables. Not long after, Island Skies began to smash through its remaining stretch goals and exceed its $75,000 goal by $2,489,821, and pull in thousands upon thousands of backers. However, cut to three years later and the project hasn't come to fruition. In fact, the entire brand of Fluffnest is slowly disappearing from the internet. The store in which Fluffnest originally sold their plushies has been taken down, and attempting to access the game's official website takes you to a domain for sale. Basically, it's not looking good for PuffPals: Island Skies. As a result, thousands of backers have started taking to Kickstarter to request refunds for their pledges.

Turns out the desire for AI is lower than we might have thought, if recent Intel reports prove true. According to Digitimes (machine translated), Intel is reportedly raising the prices of its elderly Raptor Lake chips by over 10%, and \"industry analysts believe the price increase is likely related to TSMC and the lackluster performance of AI PCs.\" Raptor Lake CPUs, of course, do not have AI-accelerating NPUs. The latest Lunar Lake chips have low power consumption and high efficiency, which makes them strong productivity chips (and good for AI) but pretty weak when it comes to gaming. According to the Digitimes report, \"AI PC sales momentum is weaker than expected\", so those running local AIs are less prevalent than otherwise expected. The same is presumably true on the desktop side with the latest Core Ultra chips as with laptop Lunar Lake ones. Effectively, it appears to be seeing customers skip the latest chips in favour of the older ones. Digitimes doesn't note specific chips in its reports, but does clarify that chips selling…",

Enter some fresh gaming speakers. Announced during last night's State of Play stream , the Pulse Elevate wireless speakers clearly feature the PS symbol—but the PlayStation blog pitches these sleek bad boys for \"desktop gaming\" specifically. With PlayStation bringing more of its platform-exclusive games to PC over time, it's maybe not actually that surprising. The Pulse Elevate wireless speakers are a swish bit of kit available in black or white colourways. These speakers also enjoy planar magnetic drivers, built-in woofers, and support for 3D audio. They've even got a neat-looking, adjustable lean-back orientation when placed in the included charging docks.

Uncovered by Tech4Gamers , the AMD patent application explains that modern computing platforms have ever greater memory bandwidth requirements. \"Because the memory bandwidth required for applications such as high-performance graphics processors and servers, which have multiple cores and a corresponding increase in bandwidth-per-core requirement, are outpacing the roadmap of bandwidth improvements for DDR DRAM chips, improved DIMM architectures are needed to meet such requirements with current DDR chip technologies such as DDR5,\" the filing says.

It's primarily an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, where the masked killer Michael Myers hunts down four residents, though this time around there will also be a singleplayer component recreating scenes from the film. This seems to be very much the OG Halloween, with no nods to the many sequels in the first trailer (though I could've well missed some), and is I believe the first game based on the film since a curious Atari version from 1983. There's stiff competition in the horror genre, most obviously from Dead By Daylight (which has Halloween DLC), but Halloween really is a hell of a license: it's the quintessential slasher film, and everything from the killer's look to the stabbing synths has become iconic. In multiplayer, this definitely seems to work in the same way as Friday the 13th. One player is cast as Myers, who has various special abilities, is unkillable, and can execute players in horrib…",

I was a little frustrated that I only got a few minutes with it because it's not often you have a product that tries to genuinely innovate in a way that might actually make sense. That's the initial impression I got from this mouse: it's trying to innovate in a way that could actually be useful. And now, after spending some more time with it and actually using it for gaming, I'm happy to say it's done so pretty successfully. The selling point here is its 'InfinitePlay' hot swappable battery system. Much like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset , the Glorious Model O3 Wireless gaming mouse can boast a kind of faux-infinite battery life, because you can swap out its 200 mAh battery with another that's kept fully charged, then rinse and repeat, swapping between the two whenever one gets low. You slot an external battery into the rear end of the mouse, then when you see the battery LED on the hub drop to red and the mouse's RGB flash red, signalling battery is less than 30%, you swap it out for the one that's been charging in the hub. …",

First, some more details as announced at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 . Qualcomm has shrunk Snapdragon X2 down to 3 nm thanks to a newer production process from TSMC. That's essentially the enabler for everything else that follows. The 18 cores are all a new third-gen Oryon design that Qualcomm claims was started from a \"blank slate.\" The result is 39% improved per-core performance and 50% faster peak multi-threaded CPU performance. To that you can add 2.3x peak GPU performance and 78% more NPU performance. What's more, Qualcomm claims to have created the first 5 GHz Arm chip. Oh, and the top chip now has a 192-bit memory bus and supports 4K 144 Hz displays. This is serious stuff. In fact, Qualcomm has introduced a whole new tier of Snapdragon for the top model.

During Sony's latest State of Play, Bandai Namco gave us a new trailer and a release date for the vampire-slaying sequel. The trailer says January 30, though on Steam it's listed as January 29 , which may be down to timezone nonsense. Now, technically I should be calling Code Vein's monsters revenants, which is how they're referred to in the series, but basically it's the same thing. In most myths and across fiction, vampires are almost always revenants, but not all revenants are vampires. A revenant, specifically if we're talking about folklore, is a spirit or corpse revived from death. Am I trying to define revenant because I don't actually have a whole lot to say about the trailer? I would never. OK, I do actually have a few things to say. The abilities? They look awesome. Weird, techno-organic wolves sprouting from your shoulders. A sword made of disgusting sinew.

Sure, Forza Horizon 4 will always have a special place in my heart, since it made Blighty the star, and even let me drive around my old university haunting grounds in Edinburgh. There's nothing quite like playing a game and being able to point out a specific set of steps you once puked up on because you were 19 and couldn't hold your whisky. But Japan is an equally tantalising prospect, with its extreme terrain, densely-packed cities and striking vistas. Forza Horizon is always a looker, and I can't wait to see what Playground Games does with the new setting. And, of course, Japan is a serious car country, boasting lots of manufacturers as well as a vibrant racing scene.

Relieving me of a bit of my embarrassment is the fact that the magazine itself also seems surprised, here's a quote (via machine translation): \"Surprisingly, this game does not have what is known as a 'character gacha,' and basically, you can get all of the playable characters just by playing the game. Seriously?! … So, what are the in-game elements that require payment? Mainly the parts that allow players to customize their clothes, vehicles, homes, and more to their liking.\" In other words, this isn't a Genshin Impact—it's just shaping up to be a solid open-world, free-to-play RPG with cute outfits and furniture you can buy with money.

My baby sister also has an actual car that she can actually drive (which is more than I ever managed). I'll admit, I don't really see the appeal of simulating an activity one could also readily engage in—so imagine my confusion when I heard about Deutschland's remote robotaxis. In the now-defunct Tegel airport in Berlin, drivers take to impressive driving simulator rigs to remotely control cars up and down the runway (via The Guardian ). Pressing pedals from hundreds of metres away, the remote drivers monitor car movement over a video feed captured by four cameras on each vehicle's roof. These remote drivers' setup is giving me serious rig envy. Many of the picks in our best PC racing wheels guide are swish, but the setup here is a cut above even that. Besides monitoring car movement on a generously sized triple monitor setup, the remote drivers also enjoy the plush cups of what appears to be the Logitech G430 wired headset. However, all of that pales in comparison to whatever high-grade…",

After following Shu through fields and some abandoned houses on your way to Rinko's house at the northeast side of Ebisugaoka, you'll stumble into a cutscene that'll lead you to a huge field shrouded in fog, with the only thing in sight being a group of scarecrows dressed as students. The scarecrow at the front will have a riddle plastered to its face. Your goal is simple: read the clue and try to figure out how it relates to one of the other scarecrows that are standing before them. Picking the wrong one can be fatal, as these scarecrows will come to life and attack you, meaning you'll potentially waste your health and your weapon's integrity. The riddle and answer will differ depending on which of the three difficulty settings (Story, Hard, and Lost in the Fog) you are playing on, but it pays to get everything right, as not only will you make it out of the fields unscathed, but there's also an achievement for picking the correct sc…",

No specifics are given on what investments are being asked for or what kinds of conversations are happening, but this is part of a broader comeback attempt from Intel. Intel has fallen behind in recent times, with the 13th and 14th Gen chip crashes only painting part of the picture. Its recent CPUs haven't been very good for gaming (while AMD has smashed it out of the park in that regard), and Intel admits it \" fumbled the football \" with Arrow Lake. As a result, a lot is riding on Nova Lake , and increased funding would certainly help it make an impact. More funding would help catch up to supply needs for any deals the company can make, too.

Not because I didn't like what I saw, but because I really wanted to properly cut my teeth on Kliff's moveset, which is about as expansive as any fighting game character's armory. Crimson Desert is the first singleplayer effort by Pearl Abyss, creators of Black Desert online, and while it has a Game-of-Thronesy aesthetic to it, that's just a thin veneer for the borderline Wuxia martial arts brawling going on under the surface.

Sometimes they're practical things, like the recently-released Dying Light: the Beast mod that reduces annoying zombie grabs —and sometimes, well, they're not. A good example of a mod that was not created to solve a practical problem is Epic's Skibidi Toilet , which creator EpicNNG said was made specifically \"to spite Samuel Winkleclank.\" That would be Borderlands 4 narrative director Sam Winkler, who apparently brought this upon himself by saying Borderlands 4 would cut back on the \"toilet humor\" of Borderlands 3 . \"If the word 'skibidi' ships in the game under my watch I'm gonna cry real tears,\" Winkler proclaimed fatefully.

Others on the team didn't experience this bug, but I saw it pop up all the way through my time in haunted Ebisugaoka. Turns out my habit of switching off motion blur without even thinking about it whenever I see it in the options menu is the problem, which I wish I'd known 20 hours ago when I started the game. Leave motion blur on and apparently you'll never experience this particular glitch. You will have to put up with cutscenes locked to 30 fps, and a stamina-based combat system, and weapon durability, and one particularly daft twist, but there are people out there who like each and every one of those things.

I read X-Men comics as a kid for probably 10 years, and Wolverine killed plenty of people in them, and I even remember a miniseries of comics where he definitely put his claws directly through a dude's face. But I feel like that was somewhat of a rare occurrence. He'd slash people up, sure, but it was rarely all that bloody on the page.

The official remaster will feature \"new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,\" according to a post from Aspyr on the PlayStation Blog . They've also rebuilt the character models, added lip-syncing to the dialogue, and thrown ragdolls into the mix. (I'll basically never say no to ragdolls, so sure, why not?)

Payday 2 has been operating for 12 years now, and in that time it's racked up an awful lot of DLC. This is, I kid you not, just a partial list from Steam: (Image credit: Starbreeze (via Steam)) It's a massive collection that would cost hundreds of dollars to purchase in total—not an issue if you've been playing for years and slowly amassing the stuff, but an awfully heavy load for newer players. That's where the Payday 2 subscription option comes in: For $5 per month, you get \"full access to all available Payday DLCs.\" You can subscribe and cancel as you like—any progress earned in DLC content will be maintained even if you cancel your sub, so you can pick up where you left off if you resubscribe in the future—and all content will remain available for individual purchase as it's always been. \"With more than a decade of content behind Payday 2, we want to give players greater flexibility in how they experience the game,\" Starbreeze's head of …",

Together, these capabilities made it a key piece of software for GTA Online's roleplay (RP) community. At the time, fans hoped this heralded a bright new era for GTA RP. Then it all went quiet. But finally we're starting to see the fruits of that acquisition, and Rockstar itself is helping to promote it. \"Nopixel V is the next evolution of the GTAV Roleplay experience, created in collaboration with Rockstar Games,\" said the X announcement . \"Coming soon to the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms—stay tuned for more information at nopixel.net .\" \"We’re excited to support the nopixel team as they create the future of GTA RP,\" said Rockstar , retweeting the above.

The idea, apparently, is to fuse \"mobile and PC\" into a single device. And given Qualcomm is part of this particular conversation, that device would presumably be running an Arm chip rather than a traditional x86 PC processor. The venue for all this is Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 , where Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon had an on-stage conversation with Google SVP of Platforms & Devices Rick Osterloh. Google said last year that it planned to base ChromeOS on Android in future, as opposed to being its own stand-alone OS. At the summit, the pair fleshed out some of the details. \"In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,\" Osterloh said. That has meant, for instance, that running Android apps on a ChromeOS device required a virtual machine. But ChromeOS will now be a part of the overall Android stack. \"We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems. \"This is …",

In a recently published blog, Microsoft explains how it has developed a system that does precisely that. By etching the surface of the processor die with an intricate pattern of tiny channels, water can then be pumped directly into the silicon itself, albeit to a very shallow depth.

    "body": "Last week brought a new update to Counter-Strike 2 that, among various tweaks to the game, added a brand-new way to obtain the game's latest set of gun skins. The set is called the Genesis Collection, though sadly Valve neglected the chance to name them all after Phil Collins songs, and can only be bought through an item called the Genesis Uplink Terminal: which is kind of a case, but not as we know it. A quick primer before we get into the functionality. Both CS:GO and CS2 award their players weapon skins or cases for hitting various in-game milestones. The way they've been awarded has changed over time, and the game's added additional cosmetics like graffiti, but these gun skins are the bedrock of a vast marketplace, the true size of which is unknown. And yeah: the ones you get just for playing can look nice, but generally hold little value, while the finishes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars are almost exclusively found in weapon crates (unlocked with a case key that costs $2.50). Weapon crates are pure RNG, and have their share of critics: some would say that the upfront cost and unknown outcome make them gambling. The new Genesis Uplink Terminal seems like a respon…",

There's been a healthy heaping of difficulty discourse surrounding Silksong, and with good reason. This game's tough as nails. I just wrapped up my 60-hour playthrough of all three acts, and I did not walk out of Pharloom with the same thumbs I started my journey with. I did almost all the mementos (I didn't bother with the Hunting Journal; I'm here to hit stuff, not collect things), got all the fleas , and alt+F4'd out of petty spite while trying to beat Seth's score in Flea Dodge. Managed it later, though. Shudder. Never again. Nice. (Image credit: Team Cherry) Silksong isn't just hard, though. It's actively mean-spirited at times. I've managed to write not one , not two , but three bench-based PSAs about hidden resting spots in terrible areas. At times, the game actively goes \"ner-ner\" and gives you a wedgie for daring to play; It hits you over the head with an Acme frying pan; It paints a tunnel on the side of the cliff, watches you splat into it, and then nicks your wallet while you're twitching on the ground. Pharloom has so many rake…",

Now it's feeling the itch again: during the last Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Summit, the mad lads announced that Yakuza Kiwami 3—a full-on remake of the 2009 PS3 game—is coming on February 12, 2026. Yes, it turns out RGG didn't accidentally write \"Kiwami 3\" on its own website for kicks last week. Who'd have thought? Oh, and the devs are putting out pretty much a whole bonus game alongside it: Yakuza 3 Gaiden: Dark Ties, where you play as Yakuza 3 bad guy Yoshitaka Mine. Go big or go home is, I guess, the RGG motto. Kiwami 3 is a full-on remake in the Yakuza 6 Dragon Engine, much like Kiwami 2 was, and once again follows world's-worst-criminal-but-best-dad Kazuma Kiryu as he tries to literally stop evil men from tearing down his orphanage. You know, like how criminals do. With the Yakuza/Like A Dragon games now firmly established in the west, Kiwami 3 will also feature an English voice dub alongside the expected Japanese. We got a taste of the dub in the trailer and, while it sounds fine, I honestly can't im…",
