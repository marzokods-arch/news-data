It's a more historical approach to grand strategy, in that you can no longer found the United States at the same time as the invention of agriculture, and was one way Firaxis hoped to encourage players to actually finish the games they started rather than getting bored and bailing prematurely (which it noticed a lot of us doing).

But after a half-dozen hours spent with this China-developed roguelite, some of its more bonkers qualities shone through, such as the flexibility of its pet system, and the fact that depending on the build you stumble into, it can turn into something more akin to Vampire Survivors. This thing can get wildly broken, unashamedly so. The kind of broken where at some point the graphics surrender and let themselves be buried beneath overlapping damage numbers. That's what I like about it. Realm of Ink is set inside fictional books, hence the name. Most of the people and creatures you encounter don't know they're fictional entities, which could be why the voice acting is so bizarrely over-the-top, making your average Tales dub seem artful and restrained. I have to confess I quickly zoned out on the story, though the meticulously illustrated worlds kept my interest.

EA is still being coy about the details, but what little else we know about Redsec has been gleaned from leaked playtests and the studio's own communications. We know it'll take place on a map set in California, feature the series' signature destruction and vehicles, and that its shrinking circle is a deadly ring of fire capable of killing meandering squads instantly. Of course, we'll know a lot more when Redsec officially drops tomorrow. Here's exactly when that's happening. Battlefield RedSec release date and time for each region After weeks of rumors about an impending shadow drop, EA decided to give everyone a day's notice. Battlefield Redsec is out October 28 , but the exact timing depends on your region. West Coast US: 8 am PT East Coast US: 11 am ET UK: 3 pm GMT Europe: 4 pm CET Redsec is launching alongside Battlefield 6 Season 1 , which itself includes a new multiplayer map, mode, guns, and a battle pass.

And equally, how few are playable anywhere but the DS, even 15 years after Nintendo stopped making new handhelds. Steam has seen HD remasters of some of the DS's best games over the years: Zero Escape Etrian Odyssey 1,2, and 3 Ace Attorney Trilogy Castlevania Dominus Collection Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective But it's a weirdly short list given just how many bangers came out on the DS over the course of its life.

Psychopomp begins with its clearly disturbed (maybe divinely ordained?) protagonist spelunking in the nightmare dungeons hidden under innocuous public buildings before descending even further into a subterranean world, and eventually ringing in some kind of an apocalypse with a doppelganger planet summoned above Earth. There's a lot of Lore here for wiki kids to sink their teeth into, but Psychopomp also works as a pure horror experience you can let wash over you, boasti…",

This multi-layered PCB is a fairly unique bit of hardware design, not only allowing for cleaner signal routing but also a neat little perch for a warm beverage. To be clear, I'm not recommending you crack open your extremely expensive GPU and fashion its pricey guts into a drinks coaster (though I bet that would look sick). Instead, I'm suggesting you take a gander at Printables user jq910's wares and 3D print yourself an RTX 5090 FE PCB Drink Coaster (via Videocardz ). Even if you don't already own a 3D printer, I bet this one is a cheaper craft than cracking open a two-grand card. All of the PCB's major components are accurately represented within the printable 3D files. However, jq910 writes that they chose to omit the power connector \"because it would get in the way of larger cups and also make the coaster annoying to stack.\" As such, jq910's representation of the PCB is somewhat simplified, and also much flatter than the…",

Playing the free demo currently available on Steam, I'm really impressed with how the core strategy has evolved. (Image credit: Bulwark Studios) In the first game's Adeptus Mechanicus vs Necron battles (think weirdo religious cyborgs vs ancient alien cyborgs, if you're unfamiliar), the key was a resource called cognition. Harvested from terminals and pillars in the environment, it was used to fuel special abilities and extra movement, but was shared across your whole team, forcing careful decision-making. For the sequel, that system's been ramped right up. Now, cognition is generated by units directly in ways that define their role on the team. Lumbering melee servitors, for example, grant you a point every time they take damage, while your Skitarii rangers instead generate one every time they shoot someone from far enough away.

Steal A Brainrot—a Roblox custom game where you hoard collectible meme characters in exchange for virtual currency, of which PC Gamer evergreen writer Kara Philips said \"sensory overload is a complete understatement\"—has filed a complaint against Stealing Brainrots, a Fortnite custom game which the Steal a Brainrot team at Spyder Games alleges is \"a copy.\" The suit states Stealing Brainrots \"copies [Steal A Brainrot's] protectable expressions,\" giving examples like \"user interface elements … in-game objects, artwork, level design, animations, design aesthetics,\" and increasingly nebulous stuff like \"the selection and coordination of game elements, colors, and shapes.\" It's worth noting that both games are specifically themed around Italian Brainrot, a specific wave of surreal AI-generated meme images that went around earning names like Chimpanzin…",

I am a man on a mission—a mission to roleplay. My craving for quality RPGs never subsides. I finish one, and then I'm off on a new quest, to find another. But like so many RPG protagonists before me, I'm also cursed. Specifically, I live with the curse of having played too many great RPGs, which means that even a perfectly fine one just doesn't cut the mustard. For a week now, I have been trying to enjoy The Outer Worlds 2 . I tried to shed all my expectations and just go with the flow, to immerse myself in the off-kilter sci-fi universe that Obsidian has created. But folks, I simply cannot get into it. And this time I can't blame its proximity to Disco Elysium. (Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment) See, when the first game came out, I made the mistake of hopping in right after I'd just finished Disco Elysium . Most games would have suffered after that; Disco Elysium has become my all-time favourite RPG. But The Outer Worlds felt particularly conservative, relying on surface quirkiness to make up for its…",

The cooler in question is the Thermaltake Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB Sync (via Hermita Akiba on X ), and the name alone gives you all the clues you need to guess what the AIO cooler looks like, assuming you've not taken a gander at the images yet. Where most vendors have been content to add a single LCD screen to their AIO blocks, Thermaltake has added four individual displays to the Minecube: one facing straight up, and the other three forming a 'wrap-around' effect, starting on the rear IO side of the motherboard before finishing at the DRAM slots side. Admittedly, having a screen facing the rear IO panel doesn't make much sense, because you're barely going to see it in an average PC case. Anyway, using Thermaltake's software, you can apply individual animated GIFs to each panel or have them display hardware info, such as temperatures and clock …",

You'll create buildings, connect them to paths and power them with electricity before inviting guests, alongside sending out research teams to discover new species you'll eventually get to hatch and raise.

Tom Henderson , who had a Grand Theft Auto 6 leak corroborated by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier last year , writes: \"Can confirm Granite is the codename for the BR.\" ModernWarzone also claims that the mode will be officially called \"Battlefield: RedSec.\" That's not to say you should take any of this for granite—dangit, granted—but those crying shadowdrop have at least had some hits in the past. Although considering the sheer scale of the October 28 patch already , it does seem like a lot for DICE to put on its plate. BF6 is already issuing weapon …",

Johan Andersson, lead on Europa Universalis 5, said in an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens that the practice can be too rigid and restraining. For Paradox Tinto, good design comes with a bit of democracy. \"Design documents stifle creativity and it reduces people's ownership and empowerment,\" Andersson said. \"You create better games by talking with your team … tell the person some broad outlines, like 'we want this,' 'it should function like this,' a few samples, and let them make the detailed decisions.

The latest trailer does just that, by informing us that Boltgun 2 will let us choose a second playable character. That character being Nyra Veyrath, a Celestian of the Sisters of Battle, to be specific. She wields a bolt pistol/power sword combo, switching to a meltagun or flamer when the enemies of the Imperium need a good superheating, and has some good mobility, with a slide move I couldn't imagine the bulky space marine Malum Caedo pulling off. As well as letting us choose between two protagonists, Boltgun 2 will have a branching campaign, with different decisions leading you through different levels. It'll also have more biomes than the first game, including a jungle swamp and a hive city to fight through. Looks like there's an ice world too?
