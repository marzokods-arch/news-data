These screening systems are designed to stop people from purchasing genetic sequences that could be used to create deadly toxins or pathogens. But now researchers led by Microsoft’s chief scientist, Eric Horvitz, say they have figured out how to bypass the protections in a way previously unknown to defenders. The team described its work today in the journal Science . Horvitz and his team focused on generative AI algorithms that propose new protein shapes. These types of programs are already fueling the hunt for new drugs at well-funded startups like Generate Biomedicines and Isomorphic Labs, a spinout of Google.&nbsp; The problem is that such systems are potentially “dual use.” They can use their training sets to generate both beneficial molecules and harmful ones. Microsoft says it began a “red-teaming” test of AI’s dual-use potential in 2023 in order to determine whether “adversarial AI protein design” could help bioterrorists manufacture harmful proteins.&nbsp; The safeguard that Microsoft attacked is what’s kn…",

A record 58% of S&amp;P 500 companies mentioned AI in their second-quarter earnings calls, according to Goldman Sachs. But it’s difficult to walk the talk. Just 5% of generative AI pilots are driving measurable profit-and-loss impact, according to a recent MIT study . That means 95% of generative AI pilots are realizing zero return, despite significant attention and investment. Although we’re nearly three years past the watershed moment of ChatGPT’s public release, the vast majority of organizations are stalling out in AI. Something is broken. What is it? Date from Lucid’s AI readiness survey sheds some light on the tripwires that are making organizations stumble. Fortunately, solving these problems doesn’t require recruiting top AI talent worth hundreds of millions of dollars, at least for most companies. Instead, as they race to implement AI quickly and successfully, leaders need to bring greater rigor and structure to their operational processes.

Its models are steeped in caste bias. Caste bias is rampant in OpenAI’s products, including ChatGPT, according to an MIT Technology Review investigation. Though CEO Sam Altman boasted about India being its second-largest market during the launch of GPT-5 in August, we found that both this new model, which now powers ChatGPT, as well as Sora, OpenAI’s text-to-video generator, exhibit caste bias. This risks entrenching discriminatory views in ways that are currently going unaddressed. Mitigating caste bias in AI models is more pressing than ever. In contemporary India, many caste-oppressed Dalit people have escaped poverty and have become doctors, civil service officers, and scholars; some have even risen to become the president of India. But AI models continue to reproduce socioeconomic and occupational stereotypes that render Dalits as dirty, poor, and performing only menial jobs.
