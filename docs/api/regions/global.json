This December update is arriving at the same time as North Line did back in November, though there's no new map this time, just the new weather condition, the Flickering Flames event, plus new quests and a Raider Deck.

After all, if you're getting cosy with certain boons in one run, it's easy to feel like the wax wings have been melted out from under you when a patch snatches that away. Talking to our friends over at GamesRadar , creative director Greg Kasavin seeks to soothe that particular ache: Kasavin uses the example of the Smithy Sprint, which was cut from the game during the Olympus Update . For context, at one point in time Smithy Sprint created a blast after sprinting for one second at the cost of 10 Magick. After the update, it got renamed to Smithy Rush, which instead causes a blast if you dash near a foe on a specific cooldown. Kasavin explains: \"In the particular case of Smithy Sprint, we wanted something simpler and easier to use for one of the main Boons from the god of the forge, though as part of that we moved the general concept of keep-sprinting-for-a-big-blast to be integral to the Black Coat weapon's Aspect of Nyx.

That's not even the wildest part, with Framework going on to clarify that its new pricing \"remains below what is available in the open market \" (link original). Previously, Framework had called out Dell and Apple for 'gouging customers' over their memory price hikes, while remaining upfront that the company itself would have to raise its own prices in the near future. Framework also took the opportunity to assure that existing pre-orders will not be affected by this latest price increase. Furthermore, both the company's pre-built laptops and Framework Desktop that come with memory already installed won't see an uptick in price either—at least for the time being. The company calls the pricing situation \"extremely volatile,\" and states it will likely need to \"make further price updates on both DDR5 modules and on our systems that come with memory, whether DDR5, LPDDR5X, or GDDR.\" The company…",

Not because the product is incredibly complex or difficult to use; far from it, in fact. And not because it was a bug-ridden, early-release mess either. Indeed not, as the MSI MEG X870E Godlike X Edition is probably the most stable, easy-to-use, and feature-rich desktop PC motherboard I have ever tested. The problem is in its name: X Edition. This is a limited release model, created by MSI to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its Godlike series of motherboards. Only 1,000 units will be made available, and restricted to Micro Center and Newegg in the US, and Scan in the UK. So the chances of an average PC enthusiast being able to buy one are astonishingly remote, even if you have a wallet capacious enough to afford the Godlike X Edition. So how does one go about testing and ultimately reviewing a product that hardly anyone will be able to buy? In some ways, MSI has made the challenge simple by taking a standard MEG X870E Godlike (though they're hardly what you call standard ) and upgrading the package to produce the X Edition. I mi…",

It contained locations, textures, and even whole NPCs that were ultimately cut to get the finished game down to a more workable size. But what was too much New Vegas for an Xbox 360 disc is not nearly enough for a heavily modded playthrough on PC, and the Fallout modding community has spent weeks going over the beta with a fine-toothed comb to restore some of the most interesting things that were lost. For starters, there's an NPC who made it to the deck of playing cards in the Collector's Edition, yet was absent from the finished game. Marilyn, the second of Mr. House's securitron lady friends, is even referenced by Veronica in the finished game, so it's a relief to finally have her return. There are actually a few mods bringing Marilyn back, but I went with the straightforward Marilyn Restored for my current loadout. On the subject of Mr. House, the skeevy Steve Buscemi-looking original depiction of the character is also back thanks to Restored Beta Mr House , and if you really want to go all the way his Lucky 38 casino was supposed …",

The announcement has sent a bunch of people back to Larian's last RPG in the Divinity setting, Divinity: Original Sin 2, which has bounced back into the list of most-played games on Steam. At the time of writing it's number 228 in the top 250 and according to Steam Charts it hit a 24-hour peak of 10,898 players, which is almost double last month's peak of 5,930 players. Though the numbers are lower, similar percentages have been checking out the earlier Divinity games, with the original Divinity: Original Sin going from a monthly peak of 941 players to 2,150, while Divinity: Dragon Commander (the result of a strategy game and a dating sim walking into a bar at the same time) went from 14 players to a whole 23.

I'm still working my way through the presentations uploaded to YouTube this year and being delighted by all the playful seriousness and serious playfulness is on display. There's nothing quite like people with impressive degrees getting into the minutiae of fictional universes created to help sell toy soldiers. The Warhammer Conference is an independent event organized by a group of academics who were sick of having their abstracts rejected by more general conferences, and decided to create a place where Warhammer was the only topic. When I asked Dr Nikolas Matovinovic about it (he presented The Fault in Our Star Children: Genestealer Cults and the Interdependence of Lore, Hobby, and Gameplay in Warhammer 40,000 remotely this year), he said, \"This is one of the more diverse and interdisciplinary conferences I have ever attended.\" That broadness of approach is combined wit…",

I thought it had peaked when Jason Charles Miller sang To The Edge in Shadowbringers— the man was on an episode of The Osbournes, y'all . Then Masayoshi Soken took it once step further when he enlisted Sam Carter—lead singer of Architects, one of my favourite metalcore bands—to sing the main theme of the Endwalker expansion. He wasn't done, though, deciding to then bring along Chrissy Costanza of Against the Current fame (also, you know, they did a butt-ton of League of Legends stuff) for Give It All, an all-out banger for the final fight of Arcadion's AAC Light-heavyweight Tier.

Far more than just a map-pack, it aimed to replicate the specific feel of Halo 3's multiplayer as closely as possible, Halo-fying its arsenal, adjusting mechanics like ballistics and gravity to better align with Halo's Moon-hopping feel, and even throwing in authentic sound effects and announcer lines for good measure. Sadly, that's all over now. On X, Project Misriah cocreator Forddoyo posted an image of a DMCA takedown notice he had received from Microsoft via Valve. The takedown notice alleges that Misriah's \"unauthorized use of Halo game content in a workshop not associated with Halo games infringes their rights\", and as such Valve had \"temporarily removed your postings from Steam\". The crux of the issue here seems to be that Project Misriah uses assets from the Halo games, hence the use of the phrase \"Halo game content\".

Phoenix Point aimed to reimplement much of the granularity that Firaxis' slicker overhauls took out, adding features like soldier inventories, multiple human factions, manual aiming, and mutating enemies. Phoenix Point seemed to have the makings of a stone cold classic. Sadly, the result amounted to less than the sum of its parts, bogged down by bugs, repetition, and micromanagement. Then came Terror from the Void , a fan-made mega-mod that radically overhauls the experience, introducing a new story, reworking progression, and adding new mechanics like ability-changing delirium infections and zombified squadmates who would fight against you. Terror from the Void is beloved by Phoenix Point fans, with many believing it represents Phoenix Point at its best.

Sure, they're usually full of people (or monsters) that want to kill us, but that doesn't make it any less charming to get to play in the snow without getting cold. Now's the perfect time to look back on some of our favourites—so I thought I'd put some together in a very chill little quiz. All you have to do is look at the screenshots of various wintery locations, and tell us which game each one is from. Simple as that, and in the spirit of Christmas generosity, I've even made it start out nice and easy. Though you might find as you go along that the later questions are snow joke… Let us know how you did in the comments—and your favourite snowy videogame location!",

Because it really is crucial, even if it did take Blizzard 21 bloody years to get with the program. MMOs are, in a lot of ways, about expression. In ye olden days of the internet, there was (and still is) a game called Second Life —this game is pretty much built on top of player-submitted stuff. Custom avatars, and, more to the point, UGC residencies that take place on a \"grid\".

Whenever someone passed through the gatehouse, the fake archer would yell \"Who goes there?\" in a big, booming voice. It's a phrase that has always stuck with me for some reason, one of those weird bits of mental detritus that rolls around at the back of the old braincase.

In the last twelve months, Ironclad has introduced features like new scenarios , population mechanics, better tutorials and improved debris visuals for prettier battle aftermaths. Now, a new update takes aim at one of the RTS' weakest areas of play, that trickiest of 4X systems to implement—diplomacy. The Diplomatic Repercussions update aims to make negotiation a more interesting and viable path to victory. As Ironclad explains in a new video, at the heart of this overhaul is a significant AI rework. NPC factions have had their brains rewired to make them both smarter and friendlier than they were before. They're more likely to form alliances and forgive past transgressions, but also more tactically adept on the battlefield should diplomacy fail. These changes tie into a substantial economy overhaul aimed at encouraging diplomatic approaches. To summarise, planets no longer generate resources by default, with resource production instead based upon population. Hence, if a planet's population takes a big hit thr…",

In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one. The release date trailer shows off quite a bit of Phantom Blade Zero we haven't seen before, including at least a couple boss fights and characters related to the story, which S-Games has so far mostly avoided showing.

Rowling wasn't involved with the development of Hogwarts Legacy but she does profit from it, and some portion of her money goes to support anti-trans organizations . But Harry Potter remains much beloved, and Hogwarts Legacy was and still is a hit: Nearly three years after it launched, there are currently more than 18,000 people playing the game on Steam alone . Unsurprisingly given that fact, the price remains pegged at the original $60. That makes Epic's giveaway—the first time Hogwarts Legacy has gone on the freebie block—a very attrac…",

She's also appeared in Return to Monkey Island, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, BioMutant, Trine 2, Mass Effect 3, and numerous others—it's quite an impressive CV.

    "body": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 is an unfinished game. Impressively unfinished, really. So unfinished that it doesn't so much have a final level as it does an idea for one that you just kind of percolate through until you hit credits. I can't blame Obsidian; the studio had an incredibly short time with which to actually, you know, make the game. It's a game that would be well-served by a remake, in other words—something that had the time necessary to give the original's vision the attention it deserved. Turns out, just such a remake was—perhaps is —notionally in the making. That's according to Game File's recent scoop on Aspyr's ill-fated attempt to get The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (the popular mod that restores a lot of cut-but-still-on-disc content to the game) onto the Nintendo Switch. More on those efforts later. Court filings from the now-settled gamer's lawsuit against Aspyr —initiated by a fan upset at the studio's \"false advertising\" of TSLRCM on Switch—have revealed the existence of project Juliet. That's the name Aspyr and Lucasfilm used for a full-on KOTOR 2 remake. \"We were going to do a full remake of KOTOR 2,\" Lucasfilm Games VP Douglas Reill…",

Last week I was: Recommending you go be cringe in World of Warcraft . It is 2019: Larian is announcing its new RPG , Baldur's Gate 3 . The studio releases a short, cinematic teaser with an emphasis on body horror—the ceremorphosis of an unwitting guard rendered in horrible, gory detail. Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh. But on the whole, Baldur's Gate 3 is a bright heroic fantasy with bloody dark spots—it's a colourful, lively game that (unless you kill everybody) is about troubled people overcoming their worst nature and horrifying fates to save the realm. The body horror in that original trailer is a theme, but it's on…",

    "body": "Almost exactly 10 years ago, OpenAI was founded. The AI outfit's CEO, Sam Altman, has marked the anniversary with a retrospective blog post which concludes much as the company's original mission statement began , with a call to \"benefit all humanity.\" Question is, how well has that ambition aged? Specifically, Altman signs his latest blog post off with these comments: \"Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I’m really proud of the trajectory the team has us on. We are seeing tremendous benefits in what people are doing with the technology already today, and we know there is much more coming over the next couple of years.\" It may seem convenient, trite, and not a little facetious to use PC gaming as a prism through which to view OpenAI. But it's actually a pretty handy starting point, not least because this is such a massive, unwieldy topic. So, anything that breaks it down into manageable chunks is very useful. Needless to say, OpenAI and its broader influence has been far from unambiguously beneficial for PC gamers.
