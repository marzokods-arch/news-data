Just announced for a 2026 release, the game brings together elements of roguelikes and autobattlers with a brilliantly weird, gross visual style created by artist John Kenn Mortensen . Set in a world where alchemists battle to drain goblins of their magical blood, it feels one part '80s fantasy, one part doodles out of the back of a troubled teenager's schoolbook, and one part something you'd see airbrushed onto the side of a van. I love it. I'd be sold on looks alone, but having gotten to play a section of Flask at Gamescom last month, I'm convinced there's a really solid roguelike here too. As you travel across a simple overworld map, you gather flasks for your homunculus warriors. These basically allow you to create a production line of actions in battle—one might be a simple attack, another a strength buff, and another a berserker strike that sacrifices health for damage. When you fight a goblin, each of you will run through all your flasks in order, and then if you're still alive, the process will continue to loop until goopy gre…",

    "summary": "When Early Access and boutique ergonomic keyboards collide.",
    "body": "This is a review that should have appeared at least two months ago, as I've had a Naya Create ergonomic keyboard on my desk since the end of June. However, for reasons that will become clear shortly, the journey between first opening the box and the publication of this review has been faltering and difficult. Had I issued my thoughts on the Create after a month of use—the typical period for reviewing an ergonomic keyboard—the final score and verdict would have been very different to what's on this page, and not in a positive way. But let's start at the beginning. Naya is a small company, based in the Netherlands, that was founded around four years ago by a group of three friends. Setting out with a goal of making the Create, a bespoke keyboard for ergonomics and productivity, Naya's designs and plans resulted in a highly successful Kickstarter campaign . Multiple batches of the Create have already been sold out and shipped, and along with the sheer amount of money raised via crowdfunding, it's clear that there are a lot of computer users around the world who very much want one. The obvious question to ask here is 'why?' and that's an easy one to answer. Naya Create specs (Image cr…",

After a new CEO, tons of layoffs, an increased focus on the Foundry side of the business, and other changes, Intel is sticking on-brand and making even more changes, this time to executive leadership. And while the biggest news for many might be that Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus is leaving, what's particularly interesting is the company is starting a new group that will focus on a new custom silicon business. In addition to these two things, Intel also announced that Jim Johnson will lead the Client Computing Group (CCG), Kevork Kechichian from Arm will join to lead Intel's Data Center Group (DCG), and Intel Foundry CTOO Naga Chandrasekaran will also cover Foundry Services. The custom silicon business that's perhaps of most interest is to be headed up by senior VP and Fellow Srini Iyengar. Iyengar joined Intel earlier in the year after being a Fellow at Cadence Design Systems, which is of note because Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was previously CEO of Cadence until 2021. The new group will apparently be looking towards serving external customers: \"Intel is also establishing a new Central Engineering Group led by Srinivasan (S…",

The news was broken by Japanese outlet Friday Digital , with a representative for Matha Farm confirming that the mare had passed due to colic, a pretty common cause of death in horses. Her age was the equivalent of almost 90 in human years, and on the upper end of a horse's average lifespan. 【独自】さようなら、ハルウララ…〝113連敗した負け組の星〟が天国へと旅立っていたhttps://t.co/YfWnOynm6c#フライデー September 9, 2025 Haru Urara was born in 1996, making her debut race two years later before retiring in 2004.

The overworld plays like a god game that has you casting spells to influence the humus. They go about their daily business with pretty limited intervention from you, farming crops, cutting down trees, electing a monarch to rule over them, and exploring the map to find new treasures and expand their village.

For a while, game director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) has promised that this'll be changing in 8.0 , FF14's next expansion. Back in 2024, he stated: \"By strongly differentiating the jobs, we will be able to reach the goal we have set ourselves.\" It is now 2025, however, and a recent PCGamesN interview from Gamescom is casting doubt. As always with these interviews, Yoshi-P often speaks in Japanese with a live interpreter, so specific word choice might be skewed based on the hard work of a poor translator having to suffer the Gamescom hall's terrible cafeteria prices and the stifling heat of a German summer. Still: \"When it comes to using the jobs in battle content and bringing out more of that uniqueness of each job, we are working on a big update.\" So far, so good, Yoshi-P.

The game's rosary economy will also become less stingy: Relics, psalm cylinders, and courier deliveries will all have their rosary rewards increased, though I imagine it'll still be hard to match the farming routes already found by players—mind, any rosary bump is a welcome one, given how miserly the game is with these things until Act 2. Speaking of, Act 2's benches and bellways will have their prices reduced, too, so you shouldn't have to grind nearly as much—a welcome adjustment, given I kept having to go back to the ol' Songclave Grand Reed mines.

Enter Dave Plummer, an ex-Microsoft engineer whose other Windows contributions include Task Manager , native Zip file support, and Media Center, to name just a few (via The Register ). Speaking on his YouTube channel, Dave's Attic , Plummer revealed that when he ported the game to Windows NT from Windows 95, he wrote a whole new game engine around the original logic in order to handle the video rendering and sound. \"My game engine had a bug, in that it would draw frames as fast as it could\" said Plummer. At the time, the game was being coded on a MIPS R4000 processor running at a mighty 200 MHz, which resulted in the game running at 60-90 fps, a speed Plummer judged as \"plenty, for a game like that.\" \"Fast forward a couple of years later, somebody notices that o…",

While Sherma doesn't seem very good at the instrument he wields—he basically whacks two nails together towards a discordant \"melody\"—he's got a lovely voice on him, especially with an excess of cavernous reverb applied. Tee Lopes, a videogame composer who's worked on Sonic Mania and Shredder's Revenge, to name a few, has released a remix of Sherma's lil' jingle. It sounds a lot like that style of saccharine European dance pop that was big in the '90s and early 2000s: music that resembles Saturday morning cartoons, but which is actually precision-geared for dancing to while high. Very high. Here it is. I like how Hornet nods out of rhythm in the accompanying video. Bugs will be bugs. Lopes has also done one for Shakra, whose banger sounds like something the Vengaboys might have released at the height of their inexplicable popularity. In the words of YouTube commenter @Akif-Faisal: \"This is what entertainment looks like\". (It may also look, depending on your temperament, like something akin to torture. Oh, the Mandelbrot complexity of human subjectivity!) For my money, …",

But first you're going to have to put up with me getting this Skonged version of the Christmas song out of my head: Silver bells, silver bells. It's Hornet time in ole Bellhart . Ring-a-ling, hear them sing, soon it will be Hornet's daaaay. Sorry. It was just in there . Blame Dean Martin! But now we can get on with it: here's where to find Silver Bells in Silksong to complete the Silver Bells wish. Silver Bells locations in Silksong (Image credit: Team Cherry) Once you've defeated the Silksong Widow boss and freed the town of Bellhart, you can find a wish board next to the town shopkeeper with several quests awaiting you. Accept the Silver Bells quest and then enter the Bellhart Bellway fast travel station. At the bottom of the station, instead of heading left to where you call the Bellbeast, head to the right and break the secret wall to enter the lower bellvein, a claustrophobic sequence of tunnels below the town. Here you'll find the crotchety Bell Hermit who doesn't have much to say; to his right is a narrow shaft that you can ascend using you…",

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. I can't think of a better way to kick off an FPS column than to gush about one of the best historical features of the genre, the server browser, while also lamenting its near extinction. It feels like shooters are ready for a shake up, but at least in this instance, I think publishers ought to look toward the past to guide them. Before every shooter had a quick match button, server lists were how we got around. If modern matchmaking is a multi-lane freeway, reliably but plainly escorting players in and out of matches curated by developers, server browsers were the scenic route: finding a place you liked to play took more time, but the results were always more interesting . Server browsers were a boon for variety, but as we've learned in the years since their disappearance, they were also crucial tools of preservation.

And honestly, under the circumstances—the media didn’t get a head start here—that feels like the best way to go about playing and thinking about this curious game, which will likely delight or disappoint depending on your attitude going in. I really like it so far, but there are some things that annoy me about it, and I don't think it lives up to the hype through no fault of its own. I’m still not completely sure why Hollow Knight got as big as it did. I totally agree that it’s a great videogame and an outstanding metroidvania. Few games in this genre trust and reward the curiosity of the player as much as Hollow Knight did, and Silksong is no different in this regard. But this doesn't sufficiently explain its popularity.

This is far from a confirmation, though, and the original game's many ending permutations complicate the character's potential return. Asked if he'd be willing to reprise the character in Cyberpunk 2⁠—formerly codenamed Project Orion⁠—Reeves said: \"Absolutely, I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again.\" And that's it, that's all he said on the matter. But it's more than we had previously, and it also raises questions as to how CDPR could continue his story. A very remote possibility is reflecting Cyberpunk 2077 choices through Witcher or Mass Effect-style save importing, but that doesn't feel like a good fit. 2077 was a very personal, self-contained story, one where putting in that effort doesn't particularly feel worth it. That's also before you consider that we likely won't even see Cyberpunk 2 before 2030⁠—10 years after Cyberpunk 2077's release⁠—and that it'd be a pretty crazy ask to cut Keanu Reeves a check for content not all players will see.

Acutis was canonised in an ancient ritual led by Pope Leo, who himself has a good shout to be the first gaming Pope . The teenager's path to sainthood has been remarkably short: the campaign to have him canonised began six years after his death in 2012; he was decreed \"Venerable\" in 2018, \"Blessed\" in 2020, and now the Pope has formally declared Acutis a saint in St Peter's Square in Vatican City. Born in London, Acutis was still a baby when his Italian parents returned home, and he would spend the rest of his life in Milan. Acutis' family recalls him enjoying videogames including, of course, Halo, as well as the likes of Mario and Pokémon. He got a PlayStation when he was eight but, as a true servant of the Lord, restricted himself to one hour of play a day. It should also be said that Acutis was clearly a remarkable child.

Start at the halfway home bench, take the elevator, then hop across the rickety platforms to get into Sinner's Road proper.

That's because of the ever-present spectre of AI hanging over our gaming hardware hopes and dreams. After all, AI hardware is where Nvidia makes the vast majority of its money these days, and given the recent loosening of chip export restrictions, I'd say it's a safer bet that most of this memory is destined for China-friendly RTX Pro 6000 variants and the like. Boo. Still, ETnews reports that Nvidia has told Samsung to double up its GDDR7 production—according to its industry sources—and that the Korean DRAM manufacturer has duly responded.

For a huge variety of reasons, most people feel pretty uncomfortable when faced with the idea of these metal men, especially when it comes to inviting them into their homes. Despite this, robotics companies seem intent on pushing ahead with these bots, despite them often not being as efficient at completing tasks as a purpose built boxy bot. This contradiction in the trajectory of modern robotics is a question University of Washington robotics professor, Maya Cakmak, has been looking to answer. Cakmak, alongside students and resear…",

Xbox has dropped a new line of wireless controllers that have some of the best aesthetics I've seen in years. The special edition Breaker Series of Xbox Wireless controllers comes in three variations, but all feature an undeniably cool shattered look to them. The faceplates have a print of broken shapes that range in colour and transparencies. In the press images it creates this layered look, almost as if you've broken through several pains of ice and can see light coming from the surface. This is unsurprisingly most true of the Ice Breaker colour option, which uses cool blues and whites to create a frosty look. The face buttons reflect this colour combination creating a really cohesive design that almost looks like it would be cold to touch. This is topped off by matching darker grey-blue sticks and triggers, as well as a matt light blue back plate. Storm Breaker is next in the list, and shares the same design but all in black white and grey. It somehow looks both old and new at once, giving off w…",

Known as Choi, the creator revealed they'd never even touched Lego before attempting the project. They told me that while shopping online, they were looking for something cheap to push the total value of their basket over an amount that would qualify for a discount—and that's when they spotted the bricks. Electing to translate their own answers from Korean into English via ChatGPT, Choi told me, \"Once I received them and started building, I thought, 'This is fun!' That’s when I wanted to try making a PC case with it. I’m not a Lego expert at all—just a beginner who started less than a year ago.\" As such, there was a lot of trial and error. \"I worked on the monitor, keyboard, and main body separately as modules.

Semiwork will not be dishing out any information on how many monsters are coming, or their appearance, ahead of time. In the most recent video Q&A , Semiwork's Pontus Sundström says \"just as the appearance of these monsters, we will keep the exact number of new monsters a secret as well. But I will say though, we are focusing on quality before quantity. We want each monster to feel unique, and different from all the other monsters.

Notably though, like other machines we've seen of this ilk, the announcement is all specs and no price or availability. CTEE.com spotted this mini AI workstation from Acer during the company's presentation last week. Dubbed the Acer Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation, the mini machines sports a Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip and is aimed at both smaller institutions and individuals looking to tackle AI workloads. Acer's own listing of the Veriton GN100 details the specs further. Apparently they've packed 128 GB of unified memory, as well as up to 4 TB of NVMe M.2 SSD storage into this box that looks about twice the of Mac Mini.

These have been recently applied to the industry by big players like Intel in the hopes of stepping ahead of the game, but they might have been beaten to the punch when it comes to commercial application of these machines. A High NA EUV lithography system has just been set up for mass production by SK hynix in its M16 fab based in Icheon, South Korea. SK hynix is a company known for making storage and memory chips. Its using a TWINSCAN EXE:5200B lithography system, as opposed to the 5000 that Intel setup last year, in an effort to produce what will likely be some of the most powerful DRAM ever made.
