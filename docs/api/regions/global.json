So it's only natural that you'd do exactly the same as one Redditor did, and try to get it to run Cyberpunk 2077. Well, they did more than just try ; they actually succeeded. In a post on Reddit , user Retrotom explains the steps they followed to get Nvidia's DGX Spark to natively run Cyberpunk 2077. The little 'AI-supercomputer-in-a-box' sports a GB10 APU, which has a 20-core Arm CPU and a Blackwell-based GPU with 6,144 shader cores. Cyberpunk 2077 runs on DGX Spark from r/nvidia The latter is, to all intents and purposes, the same GPU that's in a GeForce RTX 5070 . Same number of shaders, TMUs, ROPs, ray tracing units, tensor cores, and L2 cache. Where they differ is in VRAM and power. While the GB10 sports 128 GB of LPDDR5x unified memory across a 256-bit wide memory bus for 273 GB/s of bandwidth, the GB205 in the RTX 5070 is home to 12 GB of GDDR7. AI models need lots of RAM, which is why the DGX Spark is so heavily loaded compared to the graphics card, but as the RTX 5070 is for gaming, it us…",

That's just the kind of world we live in now. As an acknowledgement of this change, Collins Dictionary has awarded the term Word of the Year, despite, well, being two words. This week, Collins Dictionary posted a blog celebrating and explaining its choice for the Word of the Year (via The Register ). Vibe coding is relatively contentious in itself. Generative AI has been widely criticised for flagrantly ignoring copyright and for its adoption by investors declaring it's the next big thing in games, movies, or whatever art form you hold dear. And that's because there are productivity gains to be made in skipping through all the manual work of creative labour. Of course, that comes with its own set of problems. An overreliance on the black box that is generative AI can make coders less able to actually fix their own problems when they inevitably pop up. As well as this, we've seen stories of AI coding tools 'panicking' and destroying entire databases , and coding assistants being vulnerable to targeted attacks . That is to sa…",

Cyberpunk 2077 is, now, an excellent game—worthy of inclusion on our list of the top 100 games you can play right now, no less. At launch? Less so . Now, the studio has extended a little social media backing to Rockstar over yesterday's delay to Grand Theft Auto 6 . One of the many venues in which Rockstar announced GTA 6's delay to November next year was X (the everything app!). As you can imagine, the announcement attracted tens of thousands of replies ranging from disappointment to anger to jokes to expressions of support.

    "body": "It seems like the penny has finally dropped for some Arc Raiders players, as a new store update has come out, fueling the fire of discontent over cosmetic prices and the quality of the skins on offer. From the get-go, Arc Raiders has had expensive skins, with some going as high as $24/£20 and the average sitting around $20/£15. Now, this may not seem like a lot compared to games like Valorant, League of Legends, or even Overwatch 2, but Arc Raiders isn't a free-to-play game, so these charges are on top of the $40/£30 game price. (Image credit: Embark) It's an issue many players aren't willing to sweep under the rug: \"Bro, how are you gonna just shrug at $25 skin bundles in a $40 game? That's unacceptable.\" While another player points out , \"Those skin prices are kinda...brutal. And to add to that, we still have gameplay affecting items in the battlepass, in a $40 game.\" The discontent with how Embark is pricing their cosmetics has clearly been spreading for some time now, with the latest store update sparking an even angrier reaction from fans. 📡Store updateWhether you're cutting new paths topside or wading through the muck for buried treasure, gear up like a true survivor.The Le…",

However, the findings of one US repair shop suggest that this might not be the case, because at least two Corsair models don't have all of the fixes, and there's no way for owners to apply them. That's according to Matt's Computer Services on YouTube, which says that a $5,000 Corsair gaming rig, with a Core i7 14700KF, had been submitted to the repair shop three times, due to crashing in games. The host of the video explains that, having gone through every possible check and attempt at solving the problem (including usual things such as reinstalling Windows and trying a more powerful PSU), the issues persisted. It was only when they delved into the motherboard's BIOS that the penny finally dropped. The pre-built in question is using an Asus Prime Z790-P motherboard, updated to Corsair's most recent BIOS for it (version 9046). The video highlights the fact that this firmware is using Intel's 0x12B microcode, which it released i…",

Trials provides more challenges for players to complete during excursions, like damaging Hornets, searching new wave husks, or destroying Ticks, Fireballs, and Pops, alongside the quests that different raiders from Speranza give you. For each challenge, there are three milestones at 1,000 points, 2,500 points, and 4,000 points, and each milestone will reward you with a better mystery prize. (Image credit: Embark Studios) At first, I thought that these were easier quests that I could simply tick off my to-do list without thinking too much about it, and while challenges at the lower levels aren't too difficult, it often takes a dedicated run to complete them.

Naturally, I'd like to reward his hard work with some new fits, say, a cool old diving helmet. Perhaps we could have matching outfits, even? Now that would be cool. But that's where my heart immediately sank when I logged in to check the new store bundles—the first store refresh since launch. That new Scrappy diving helmet added in the new Deep Sea Bird set costs 900 raider tokens, and includes the Scrappy outfit, an emote, and a little charm. Thankfully, all of these items can also be purchased individually, but the cool helmet costs 700 tokens by itself. Either way you cut it, you need to purchase the 1,150 token pack for £7.79 to cover it.

For studios planning a November 2026 launch, that nightmare became reality today when Take-Two announced a new delay . GTA 6 was originally slated to release on consoles in Fall 2025—around now!—before its initial delay to May 2026. If you look at the major games releasing in May 2026 as of now, you'll notice there's basically nothing because everything is shambling to escape Rockstar's orbit. And while it's true that May isn't usually a busy month for blockbuster game releases, in 2025 we saw Doom: The Dark Ages and Revenge of the Savage Planet hit PC, both of which would be cremated alive in a battle against GTA. Speaking anonymously to The Game Business on the announcement of GTA 6's first delay , the \"boss of one of the world's biggest game publishers\" admitted that Rockstar sucks a lot of money and time out of the market and that \"we don't want to be anywhere near that.\" Another anonymous s…",

It clarified a few basic things, like being able to buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance (and therefore with in-game gold via WoW tokens) and that it intends to keep the catalog small compared to what you can earn by playing the game. \"Housing items tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop,\" it says. \"Thematically important decor that players know and love will also not appear in the shop.\" Then it went on to explain why it's adding a premium currency in the first place, especially when it already sells mounts and cosmetics for real money values.

Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it.

Its continuing survival is notable because Rockay City brings a genuinely impressive cast of C-tier celebrities to the table—Michael Madsen, Chuck Norris, Michael Rooker, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, Kim Basinger, and Vanilla Ice—and yet is one of the most utterly mid-tier, 'why did they make this' videogames ever.

All those votes of approval from players haven't gone unnoticed by the team who have been pouring their efforts into the game for the past 11 years. \"Today, we reached an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' review score and it was an immensely emotional moment for us,\" Greenheart Games co-founder Patrick Klug posted on Steam. \"We were elated and grateful to reach this milestone among the bug-fixing and support spree. \"A bit later, I had a moment for lunch by myself when I briefly burst into tears. 11 years we have worked on this game, giving it our all, with no guarantees,\" Klug wrote. \"While obviously these are very early days and this game won't be an overnight success (nor a guaranteed one), it was a moment of brief validation.\" That's prett…",

Say hello, then, to the Minisforum MS-R1 (via PC Watch ), a compact PC with an Arm chip and a full-sized x16 PCIe graphics slot. Game over for x86? Not so fast. For starters, the Minisforum MS-R1 runs a Cixin P1 CPU . It's a Chinese made chip built on 6 nm technology and configured with eight Cortex A720 performance and four Cortex A520 efficiency cores. In other words, we're talking off-the-shelf Arm cores first introduced in 2023 and part of Arm's mid-range Cortex A700 range, which is more about efficient mobility than outright performance. Arm's Cortex X900 series and, soon, the C1 Ultra, represent Arm's most performant cores of the moment. This is also a compact machine. So, even with that full physical x16 graphics slot, you're not going to be fitting an RTX 5090. Even a mid-range GPU probably won't fit. The slot is also limited to eight PCIe Gen 4 lanes, electrically, which is arguably suboptimal, even if, in reality, that's u…",

That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm.

RDR bucked that expectation when it straight-up killed poor ol' John Marston at the end. Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish.

While it's far from ideal for casual players who simply want to reset their tree, the Expedition Project is a smart approach to the controversial wipes mechanics of other extraction shooters. For the unaware, the Expeditions system is basically Arc Raiders' answer to hardcore players asking for regular account wipes. It's voluntary, unlike in Escape from Tarkov, but it'll reset pretty much all of your progression and effectively retire your character, letting you create a new raider and start from scratch every eight or so weeks. It's like prestige mode in Call of Duty.

What actually happened was that the game sold pretty well as an entertaining open world romp, and we all moved on with our lives. In other words, Ubisoft made an Ubisoft game . Nothing exploded because a Black samurai was in it. Gaming survived. Part of why Shadows' release was uneventful was, in part, because of Ubisoft's sudden pivot to, essentially, ' stop feeding the trolls .'

No, it wasn't the whiskey playing tricks on me, it was instead another gift from my mischievous editor-in-chief. This time he's sent me a $23 Amazon Basics USB condenser microphone to review. Goody. Actually, I shouldn't be so quick to judge. Pulling the mic from its default cardboard packaging reveals a surprisingly weighty little chassis, and that's a promising start. I've had the privilege of working with some roadworthy audio equipment over the years, and the little Amazon Basics mic has the same sort of heft I'd usually associate with something gig-proof, like a Shure SM58 or SM57.

In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices.
