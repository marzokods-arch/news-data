Verified Link: Steam There's a simple reason: I never trusted I could do it without exploding my whole skeleton. Nevertheless I behold the skateboard with a kind of talismanic reverence.

Skate Story is one of the best-sounding and most stylish games I've played in recent memory. It's an…",

This week I've been: rounding off my stash value to $2 million so I can enjoy the rest of the season. As someone who was skeptical of the value of the Expedition in Arc Raiders at first, I'm more surprised than anyone that I actually kind of like Embark's approach to the rewards now it's revealed what we're getting . You earn a special bragging rights skin for completing the base Expedition , along with 12 slots of permanent extra stash space, but also temporary boosts to XP, repairs, and Scrappy materials next season. In a sense, you trade all of this for the things you lose, such as blueprints, quest progress, and workbench upgrades. We also get up to five skill points above the level cap for every new Raider we start, at the cost of $1 million per point in coins and stash value when the Expedition leaves. Now, yes, that is an astonishing amount of money, but I think it achieves the balance of what a Prestige mechanic is supposed to be about. Completing the Expedition is an optional grind for more invested players, but getti…",

    "body": "Meta has reportedly pushed back the release of its mixed reality (MR) glasses, codenamed \"Phoenix\", to 2027. That's despite having already spent billions of dollars on projects for digitally enhancing our everyday world. On the plus side, we have received more information on the next Quest headset. Allegedly stated in two internal memos seen by Business Insider, Meta is reportedly pushing back the glasses to \"get the details right\". These memos are said to state that Meta needs \"breathing room\" in order to put out a \"fully polished\" device. It was originally suggested to launch in the latter half of 2026. Reports suggest Meta's MR glasses are a bit closer to goggles and even come with a power puck, like the Apple Vision Pro. If true, this would tether the device somewhat but could also allow for a more lightweight feel in the headset itself. With the current state of AI, and worries around privacy that come from someone being able to capture or stream any moment for any reason, I don't think I'm particularly excited for a world with more smart glasses in it. This is before mentioning that data taken with smart glasses will be used to train AI (unless you specifically opt out). Met…",

    "body": "Good news, an actually good Windows update is here. But it likely won't be useful for a while. Still, the foundation has been laid for your apps to update themselves thanks to the introduction of the Unified Update Orchestration Platform (UOP). The UOP will \"download and install updates based on user activity and system state\". Though rather than Windows Update, which provides patches for the OS and some applications and services, or Microsoft Store, UOP allows apps to stick to their own backend updating service. So, think of it like the OS helping apps to download updates when the system isn't in use. Apps need to be registered to the UOP via an API, but once done, they can stay up-to-date without monitoring. In a Microsoft blog back in May this year, product manager Angie Chen said UOP is a \"Unified future for app updates\", as it will work with both Windows and non-Windows apps. Windows will then provide a unified app update history for all updates on the system, so all in one place. (Image credit: Microsoft) As of right now, no apps actually utilise UOP, but users on the Dev and Beta channels will slowly start to get access.

Its MMX 330 Pro cans are supremely comfortable, the open-back design with STELLAR.45 drivers makes games, music, and everything in between sound phenomenal. But it's not perfect. Aside from the obvious lack of microphone for game chat, it's also not the most portable headset for gaming on the go. So in an attempt to remedy this, Beyer has introduced a lighter, closed back headphone with an easily detachable cable that can work both 3.5mm and USB-C. The new, smaller, Beyerdynamic DT 270 Pro can't beat my beloved DT 900 Pro X in sheer performance and comfort but it can certainly pack down into my backpack a helluva lot easier while still giving me that sweet, sweet Beyerdynamic sound. The design language is pure Beyerdynamic minimalism. Matte black cups, spring-steel headband, understated padding—no RGB strips, no gamer logos, nothing you'd be embarrassed to wear out and about. Though, while I wouldn't say it feels cheap, it certainly lacks the panache of its more expensive siblings. At just 194 grams, it feels impossibly light compared to most gaming headsets, yet it barely shifts on your head du…",

A good chunk of the post is dedicated to his interactions with the community over the last three decades. \"My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas,\" he said. \"I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.\" Harada said that those experiences \"became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator,\" something which continued even as both Tekken and the FGC at large grew bigger. \"Many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for…",

This was to be known already, given the sheer volume of NPCs you talk to when you're running around in the thing—'tis a fact that is self-evident. But did you know exactly how much spoken dialogue, down to the very second? Well, one fan, who seems to've done the legwork, is able to answer that question: 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds. User Everwhite-moonlight on the Baldur's Gate 3 subreddit has compiled a spreadsheet that tallies not only the hours spoken by each character (and their respective voice actor), but also the amount of files they speak in. For example, Amelia Tyler, who voices the game's silk-toned narrator, is understandable top billing at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds of chatting—over a brain-boggling 7,629 files. Hilariously, Astarion takes the prize for biggest yapper in all of Baldur's Gate, just one hour shy of beating out the main character's literal inner monologue: 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. Larian's work is even more impressive when Everwhite-moonlight tallies it up, though: \"There are about 173,642 voice files in the game with the combine…",

We're not just getting a new character, of course, though Season 20 is, I hate to say it, another oddly small update. Stadium fans like myself certainly have the better deal, too. Below, I'll go over when you can play Overwatch 2 Season 20, and everything you can expect to sink your teeth into. Overwatch 2 Season 20 release date and time OW2 Season 20 begins on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, at 11 am PT / 2 pm EST / 7 pm GMT , which coincides with the usual update time for the game in your region.

The Zagreus Journey mod adds a third option to your choice of how to leave the Crossroads, a Chaos Gate labeled \"Descend into Nightmare\". Jump inside and you'll be back in Tartarus, with all the old shades and traps to contend with, before working your way up through Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx. Even the original game's soundtrack is carried over. What isn't carried over is Zagreus himself, and so you'll be playing as Melinoë (and whichever familiar you bring), with one of her keepsakes equipped, and encountering the pantheon and earning the boons of Hades 2.

There's an escort mode with a playable civilian class, four-team modes, jump pads, new weapons like the nail gun, dynamite pack, and tranquilizer gun, and more. But that's not the reason for its renaming. As the modders explained , \"Valve requested a few months ago that we rename our mod, because the name Team Fortress 2 Classic was too similar to their Team Fortress Classic.\" \"We've learned that various other mods have recently used the word 'classic' in ways that unintentionally made them look like official Valve products, and as a result, Valve had a new policy put in place back in September.\" Choosing a new name was \"surprisingly difficult\" both because they wanted a name that meant they could retain the TF2C abbreviation, and \"it quickly became apparent that few options actually embodied what we set out to do better than 'classic' had. …",

Skarven's first trailer is all mood and light on action. The player approaches a lonely country house with an industrial mill looming behind. In Danish, a TV anchor drops some crumbs of world building as the player creeps through the house: We're seeing a rising retirement age and increased labor automation thanks to a Children of Men-style bottoming out in fertility rates. We pick up a chunky, Fallout 10mm-looking pistol, the TV cuts out, and a freaky, Nihilanth -type dude pops out to attack. I'm digging what I see, including an oppressive northern European dreariness, some great sci-fi/alt history scene setting, and stellar art direction, which pairs Mathorne's style with early aughts, PS2 vibes, but \"how you remember it.\" I'm reminded of Nightdive's approach to the System Shock Remake, which boasted high-fidelity assets paired with deliberately noisy, pixelated textures.

One that could serve as the perfect ambience for my day-to-day life: working, cooking, cleaning, and unwinding with a glass of wine and my Steam Deck. And what better fodder for my super chill, super relaxing playlist than videogame music? After all, its entire purpose is to create ambience. It's vibes personified. Instead of telling you how it's feeling, it's trying to tell you how you should feel. Ooh, don't you feel so fuzzy and nostalgic as I play the flute in this quaint woodland village? Isn't the sul ponticello on this violin making you scared? You get my point.

One of those is Northgard , a Viking-themed RTS that was released in 2018. Built on traditional strategy foundations, Northgard added novel ideas like game-altering weather systems and a region-based expansion system. The result is one of the best strategy games of the last decade. \"While the inspiration is clear, it would be a disservice to imply that it's mainly trading in nostalgia,\" Fraser Brown wrote in his Northgard review , awarding it a score of 84%. \"This Viking saga builds on the history-themed RTS romps of the '90s, but it's not beholden to them.\" Northgard went on to sell over 5 million copies and receive a bunch of expansions and DLC. Now, developer Shiro Games has bundled several of these additional adventures with the base game to form Northgard: Definitive Edition , which throws in a few new features for good measure. Chiefly, the Definitive Edition combines the base game with the Cross of Vidar expansion, which introduces a new campaign where you must guide your Viking Clan through new lands in a post Ragnarök world.

So popular, in fact, that it's even a surprise to developer ArenaNet. The game's recent remaster, Guild Wars Reforged , launched Wednesday as a free update for existing players and an inexpensive way to get in for newbies. While most Guild Wars fans are on to the game's more traditionally MMO-ish sequel , Reforged still brought the game's concurrent player peak on Steam up to over 5,000 at time of writing, according to SteamDB . That may not sound like a lot, but it's floated for the last several years at around 200-600, and since the game came to Steam relatively late in its life, there's likely a big contingent of people playing on the standalone client available on ArenaNet's website (anecdotally, that's how I play both Guild Wars games when the mood strikes).

Released in 2014, this survival roguelike is in many ways Inventory Management: The Game. That probably sounds awful, and would be, were it not for how ingeniously devised it is.

But the biggest planned patch of 2025 was the naval update, which aims to expand Rust's survivalist battles to the oceans, letting players build their own ships and exchange cannon blasts in seaborne conflicts. But players hoping to get their pirate on in Rust will have to keep their powder dry a while longer, because the naval update has been delayed. In a blog post on Facepunch's website titled \"Shipwrecked\", COO Alistair McFarlane explained the situation: \"For almost 12 years we have managed to deliver weekly updates or, in more recent years, guaranteed monthly updates with meaningful changes. It has become part of Rust’s identity. Turning up, every month, without fail. Not today,\" he wrote. \"We took on too much.

At the time, I speculated this would be the long-awaited addition of a third playable faction to the RTS, and I was right! Well, sort of. Tempest Rising's third faction is playable now in the RTS, but only in beta, and only for the next two weeks. That third faction is The Veti, an alien race with ancient Egyptian stylings originally encountered in the latter third of the single-player's parallel campaigns. They're radically different from the RTS' existing human factions—the technologically advanced GDF and industrious, inventive Tempest Dynasty—summoning buildings rather than constructing them, and attacking their enemies with laser-toting floating pyramids and ground troops that shoot bees.

November's bike patch brought bicycles, scooters and associated infrastructure to player-created metropolises, and now, developer Colossal Order has finally added its hotly anticipated asset editor too.

The developer admitted in March that the editor had \"proven more technically challenging than initially anticipated\".

Take a look: As we can see in the clip, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) have been running a scam that sounds a bit like the con from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: turn over an outlaw (in this case, The Ghoul) to the authorities (who appear to be the Great Khans, a faction from Fallout: New Vegas) and collect the bounty. Then, while the outlaw is being hanged, shoot the rope and \"use whatever violence necessary\" to kill everyone and escape with both the money and their lives.

Tagawa appeared in everything from big-budget films to long-forgotten TV series over his long career. In 1987 he was \"Asian buyer\" in an episode of MacGyver and \"Thug in Flashback\" in the low-budget action flick Bulletproof; he also had a speaking role as Chang in The Last Emperor, which won nine Academy Awards that same year.

The 11th year of The Game Awards kicks off on Thursday, December 11 at 5 pm PT/8 pm ET, and voting for award categories is already underway. As usual, Keighley is playing his cards close to the vest about what announcements will be in the show. A few appearances are already confirmed, such as Resident Evil 9, Exodus, and a performance from Evanescence (sure to bring the crowd to life). Of course, there are also the far less certain rumors about what will appear based on a mix of insider reports and good ol' gut feelings. For instance: That Assassin's Creed 4 remake that Ubisoft refuses to say is real has gotta be imminent, right? Here's what we know about The Game Awards 2025 so far. Confirmed trailers We know for sure we're getting a \"terrifying new look\" at Resident Evil Requiem during The Game Awards. It's about time we saw the action half of that game that supposedly exists—maybe even a Leon appearance?

Now it seems the game most likely to usurp it is Slay the Spire 2 , which is coming in March 2026—though there was apparently a 50% chance that the indie team at Mega Crit Games would never make a sequel. \"We had been working on a bunch of tiny projects, little prototypes, and were having fun but said 'okay, let's get together again,'\" Mega Crit co-founder Anthony Giovannetti told PC Gamer in an interview for The PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. This was during Covid, when the two were ready to tackle a project they could really sink their teeth into. That project being another Slay the Spire was not a given, despite having sold well over a million copies by then. \"We had different paths we could work on,\" Giovanetti said. \"One was a completely different project, and one was the sequel. I thought there were some interesting design challenges to work on a sequel with. We ended up flipping a coin, actually, and Slay the Spire 2 won out. So we started working on …",

Either way, I'm here to blow away your dreams with a V.A.T.S.-aimed guaranteed crit: Purnell confirmed in an interview with Geek Culture that \"Ghoulcy\" is not happening. To be more accurate, her exact words were \"Here's what I would say: you guys need therapy. You can't fix him. You can't save him. Let it go. Let it go, hon.\" She added later in the interview that what Lucy and the Ghoul have is a \"really beautiful thing\" and said \"they're both looking for the people that they love; let's leave it at that.\" Much like Walton Goggins in that clip, who remarked he had never heard of this pairing with a beaming smile, Ghoulcy was not on my radar. However, there is a small but fanatical subreddit dedicated to the theoretical ship. It doesn't seem like they're taking the news well; one comment from user Funishin replied to a thread about the interview saying, \"Writers are too cowardly to make Ghoulcy actually happen.\" I shouldn't be surprised; the internet is …",
