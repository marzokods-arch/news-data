It's a pre-release build of Fallout: New Vegas from a month before it went on sale, one that's two gigabytes larger than the final version and jammed full of things that were ultimately cut or altered from the New Vegas that arrived on shelves in 2010. This build, and a release build with debug features enabled as well as another drive with the DLC, were found on a pair of Xbox 360 dev kits in a second-hand store where they'd been sitting for a year. Some of the stuff that's been unearthed was already discovered in the PC version, but is present here in expanded form. For instance, it's long been known that Mr. House originally had a second securitron girlfriend named Marilyn—she's on one of the playing cards that came with the collector's edition, and there's a mod to restore her along with the single voice line left in the release version. But load up this build and you can have a whole conversation with Marilyn . There's also an early version of Mr. House, with a face that looks a lot more Steve Buscemi than the suave charac…",

But here's something really different: as if to explore the frontier of unintended ways to play Minecraft, YouTuber smillgames has elected to play it on a printer . The sort used in restaurants. Eyup. Unlike the numerous attempts to play Doom on increasingly basic technology— a vape , or itself , for instance—this isn't about getting the game itself to run on the device. In smillgames' scenario, a different device is running Minecraft as normal. The receipt printer is merely used as a monitor of sorts, as he shared in a post on X . my next video might actually be the dumbest thing I've ever done pic.twitter.com/HFz6bAiCYH November 22, 2025 There is precedent for this; I think smill is getting the same sort of FPS I was getting on Oblivion back in the day.

A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct. For those who haven't seen Kill Bill, or maybe just forgot, one of the film's secondary fights is a showdown between The Bride and Gogo Yubari , a teenage psycho killer in the employ of O-Ren Ishii, head of the yakuza in Tokyo. Gogo dies, rather badly (spoiler, sorry), and then, well, so does everyone else. The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film. Based on the teaser, Yuki is basically Gogo, except maybe a little psychotically peppier and with a fondness for guns rather than a meteor hammer.

The way Captain Wayne perfectly nails a '90s cartoon look in active gameplay also reminds me a lot of Pizza Tower. The whole arsenal has a great feel to it: One real winner is Captain Wayne's machine gun, which has to spin up like a mini gun and shakes the entire screen as it empties your entire ammo reserve in a matter of seconds. It's hard to stand out as a videogame shotgun these days, but the one in Captain Wayne has a great sound and feedback, this excellent two-shot pow pow chk chk rhythm that really clicked with me.

In its most recent Q3 earnings call , Dell revealed that the Windows 11 transition is still underway, and it's actually a lot slower than the shift to Windows 10 was back in the day. Dell's COO Jeffrey Clarke says during the earnings call : \"We have not completed the Windows 11 transition.\" I wish I could call that shocking, but it's really not. It took until July 2025 for Windows 11 to overtake Windows 10 as the most popular Microsoft operating system. That was nearly four years since its initial release, and was likely spurred by the fact that Windows 10 was reaching the end of support. We saw an uptick of Windows 11 users in a recent Steam Hardware Survey , showing just how many users were holding off until the last minute. (Image credit: Microsoft) Dell compared the rate at which people are upgrading now to the time when people were making the switch to Windows 10.

Arc Raiders already has heaps of fantastic cosmetics for every type of player, whether you're a bloodthirsty PvP'er running around in a fear-inducing mask or a humble Minion-like fisher who wouldn't hurt a fly. After making friends with many a raider, being betrayed almost as often, and even taking a few names myself on occasion, I thought it wise for my own pre-match planning to mull over my approach. I know they say don't judge a book by its cover, but if I've got loot and there's another raider nearby, I've not got long to make a move to decide our fates. I'm usually one to say hi and reveal my location first, and shoot only if I need to. Well, that's what I thought until I went through each outfit one by one and realised there's an awful lot of players I'd blast in a heartbeat.

Those of you hip to pattern recognition might note that those predecessor games seemed to get multiple expansions (Origins, likewise, got multiple), but it seems that won't be the case for Shadows. In a chat with JorRaptor (via IGN ), the game's associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois said that, \"at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned, currently.\" Which is a tad surprising, given Ubisoft's recent statement that the game is \" Overperforming \" against its expectations. I think the wording here is worth bearing in mind. Ubi's got no mondo-size expansions in the pipe, but Lemay-Comtois notes that \"We're still working on content for post-launch, and supporting it,\" so it's not quite as though the game is just being dropped.

Asus itself has said that you should download these patches \"immediately\", and with good reason. The MyAsus app update fixes a flaw, rated as high severity, that could give unauthorized attackers higher system privileges. On the router side, researchers found a few different flaws, and some of them seem dangerous—two are rated \"high\" and one is rated \"critical\". The worst bit is how widespread these vulnerabilities could potentially be. The MyAsus app is pre-installed on Asus PCs, and it's used for things like system maintenance and updates. As a result, any flaws in that app could put a lot of users at risk. And seeing as Asus ranks high on the list of the best gaming routers , any vulnerabilities within their firmware are a big deal, too. (Image credit: Future) Asus notes that the security updates for the MyAsus software apply to \"all personal computer, including desktop, laptop, NUC, and All-in-One PC.\" If you own any of those products made by Asus, you'd best get your updates in order ASAP.

So, what exactly is going on here? This is all a bit complicated. But it turns out that AMD entered into a hugely complex licensing arrangement with Chinese chip producer Hygon way back in 2016. Reports from years ago imply the move was made somewhat out of desperation, what with AMD being so strapped for cash at the time. Immediately, the question of how any of this is possible leaps to mind, what with hugely complex cross-licensing arrangements between Intel and AMD that effectively prevent any other company from getting in on the x86 CPU game.

I feel like I've already spent 100+ hours with the best one. If you're one of the unlucky few who's yet to pick the game up, you may want to get on that. Sega's announced that, when Yakuza 0's spruced-up Director's Cut releases on December 8, the original version's getting delisted. So far, Sega's only said it's getting delisted on Steam, and I'm not sure if that will also apply to other storefronts. I've reached out to Sega to ask about this, and will update if I hear back. You might think that's not such a big deal. After all, the Director's Cut will contain all the parts of the original game inside it like a beautiful criminal pupa, but the shift also entails a big change in the game's price. Right now, you can pick up original Yakuza 0 for a paltry $20. When it launches, the Director's Cut will set you back $50. Sega even—a little cheekily, I think—notes that if you were to pick up …",

Which, one might worry, could eventually include drugs. As a matter of fact, its creator Tyler tells our friends over at GamesRadar that this was enough of a concern to develop a backup plan in case Steam didn't accept the game to its platform: \"Early during development, I had a plan where, if Steam wouldn't take it for whatever reason, I could just pivot it to be a farming game. Just strip all the drug stuff out, make it a farming game—but thankfully, it was all right.\" That's not to say Tyler's had it easy when it comes to international censorship or ratings issues. Easy enough to be a bestseller, sure, but not entirely immune to oversight: \"A couple of countries don't love it; that's fine. Australia was one of them for a little while.

    "body": "We all saw it coming, but it still doesn't feel great. It seems that the RAM shortage that has us all mourning the not-so-terrible prices of a few months ago might now also open the door to a GPU shortage, and small GPU vendors will be hit the hardest. Reputable leaker Golden Pig Upgrade Pack on Weibo (via VideoCardz ) claims Nvidia is planning to stop bundling VRAM with its GPU dies. Nvidia always supplied both the GPU and the VRAM to its add-in card (AIC) partners... well, potentially up until now. This made it easier for GPU manufacturers to stay on spec, but also removed the need for them to source DRAM directly from memory giants like Micron or Samsung. So, Nvidia took care of the VRAM and the GPU die, and the AIC did whatever they wanted with the rest of it, customizing the graphics card before selling it. If Nvidia has indeed decided to only ship the GPU going forward, its board partners will now need to secure VRAM all on their own. Given how volatile normal memory pricing is right now , that could be a challenge for some brands. The short supply of memory doesn't just affect the RAM kits we stick in our PCs. It will extends to VRAM, too, with production being pointed towa…",

Incredibly, it's claimed the chip will pack 288 MB of last-level vertical cache memory. That's well over double the 128 MB of V-Cache currently offered by AMD's top X3D CPU, the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D . This news comes somewhat cryptically from one of the most reliable leakers in the business, kopite7kimi (via WCCFTech ). It's a slightly convoluted data trail. But to cut a long story short, kopite7kimi responded to a story discussing 144 MB verticle cache allocations, which is expected to be known as bLLC or big last level cache in Intel parlance. For certain versions of Intel's upcoming Nova Lake CPUs, kopite7kimi clarified that there will be models with two compute tiles and thus double the stacked cache. So, according to this information, the top Intel Nova Lake CPU will have two compute tiles, each with eight Performance and 16 Efficient cores, plus 144 MB of vertical cache or bLLC. That makes for a total of 48 cores and 288 MB of Intel's equivalent to AMD V-Cache. The chips will also have another four low-power Efficient cores located in the SoC tile, making for a…",

Meanwhile, one of the most prominent brands in performance PCs, Cyberpower, has revealed plans to increase system prices on December 7 . Both moves are in response to the ongoing memory supply crisis. In a statement on X, Framework said: The memory market is in a bad spot. We haven’t changed our memory pricing, but we did have to delist standalone memory from our Marketplace to head off scalpers and preserve inventory for people buying it with our DIY Edition laptops. https://t.co/4zDF9QvnkA November 25, 2025 \"The memory market is in a bad spot.

The Deer grows a little more aggressive with each rescue, too, as finding a kid also means adding to your day counter—a curse and a blessing that speeds up the passage of time.

(Yet despite skipping class the day we learned about the War of the Austrian Succession, I still haven't invaded Silesia. I knew that guy was full of it!) But forget real history (I always do) and let's talk about videogame history. You probably remember the year, and maybe even the day, your favorite videogame was released, especially if you're now counting the days, and maybe even the years, until the sequel comes out. Time to put your release date knowledge to the test in our first \"sort 'em out\" style quiz. In each question in the quiz below, I'll give you three games, and all you have to do is put them in order of their release, from earliest to latest. I'm not asking you to know the specific dates, you just have to put 'em in the right order by dragging and dropping 'em. Good luck, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

This week, as spotted by GamesRadar , BG3 players have found a way to recruit a fighting force of the most powerful beings in Larian's version of Faerun. It's children. They're building armies of children. The process is laid out in a YouTube short from BG3 aficionado and seeming evil mastermind Morgana Evelyn titled \"Child Labour is Unbeatable.\" That name alone should tell you what kind of moral dimensions we're working with here. If the idea of conscripting a horde of combat orphans doesn't pass your ethical sniff test, you probably won't enjoy where the rest of this goes. To pull this off, you'll need a level 7 Companion character with access to the Dominate Beast and Polymorph spells. With that character, you'll need to select your ideal child combatant—or because they all perform identically, any child combatant—and polymorph them. Once they're in sheep shape, hit them with Dominate Beast, and then travel to your camp. Once there, Morgana recommends ena…",

Sounds unbelievable, but it's true! Audio experts, laptop makers and Windows developers all worked together to confirm the story—so when I was re-reading the 2022 Microsoft blog that first made the story news, I suddenly found myself wondering what other damage precisely the right (or, I suppose, wrong) sound frequency could do. For example: Could you cause a chicken's head to explode with just the power of sound? A comment on the 2022 blog casually suggests that perhaps such a thing is possible. \"There is also the story of the resonant frequency of chicken skulls from the old Borland Turbo C++ documentation,\" it says.
