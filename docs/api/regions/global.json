Many users were already disgruntled with the Connect Plus subscription after spending big money on a Garmin device. ‘Tis the season when every platform rolls out a Wrapped-style recap of the year, and Garmin has joined the crowd with its new Connect Rundown. Before you rush to review your metrics, you should know that you won’t see it unless you’re paying for Connect Plus. TechRadar reported on the feature’s release, with the Rundown bundling your yearly stats, such as steps, sleep scores, workout totals, Fitness Age, and more, into a shareable summary. Other services, like YouTube and Spotify, offer that kind of recap for free, and Duolingo even incentivizes you to share it . Garmin has opted to make it a premium perk.",

Some critical connectivity features like Wi-Fi support and notifications were paywalled behind Premium. Nuki has now decided to do away with Premium subscriptions, instead selling the Smart Lock for a slightly higher upfront cost. Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference. And today we’ve got a critical update on that. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

When we’re anticipating the next generation of one of our favorite mobile devices, we get very excited when the first specs start arriving. Right away, we’re going to be comparing those against existing models, looking at what’s getting better, what’s staying the same, and what — god forbid — is getting a downgrade.

With this upgrade, Gemini will be able to search your files, folders, and subfolders and answer specific questions. These features are currently exclusive to Google Workspace users, which includes enterprise users and those with Gemini subscriptions. If there’s one feature Google wants to be invariably present across all of its apps and services, it’s Gemini. In addition to the Gemini gateway (part of the Google app) on Android, the assistant has, or at least some features powered by it have, slowly crept up into other Google apps, including Messages, Photos , Home , and more. For Workspace users specifically, Google also adds Gemini-based assistive features to Gmail, Drive, and the office suite, gently reminding them of its capabilities . Now, Google is expanding its prowess in Drive, offering more insights into a folder’s contents and even sharing an overview of the files and subfolders stored inside. Google recently announced it is rolling out Folder highlight, which provides a summary of a folder’s contents, elaborating on the purpose of the files it contains. It …",

I question whether the hardware is mature enough to deliver on that dream, but one thing’s for sure: Samsung’s Galaxy XR comes closer to realizing it than Vision Pro.

The other alternative is to call other users over Meet, but it requires their accounts to be added to the display as well. In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language. Now that Meet has replaced Duo, Google seems to be killing the option to call your home devices.

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Sideloading files to Wear OS usually requires complex ADB commands, but the new Wear APK Install app offers a simpler solution. The app creates a Wi-Fi file server, allowing you to transfer APK files from a phone or PC browser and install them directly on the watch. This is a paid application that also serves as a file manager. If you use a Wear OS smartwatch with your Android flagship, chances are that you’ve been tempted by the newer watch faces that Google has released for the Pixel Watch 4 . It’s possible to install these watch faces on other watches, but you need to know how to sideload using ADB on your smartwatch. While the process is straightforward if you can follow a guide , it’s admittedly still a bit too complicated for the average user. Thankfully, there’s a new app on the block that makes it easy to install APK files on your smartwatch, while also offering file manager functionality.

Today, the company is rolling out the second quarterly platform release of Android 16 — known as Android 16 QPR2 — for the Pixel 6 series and newer. While this update may not be quite as massive as the first quarterly drop , it’s still a significant release packed with new customization options, productivity features, security enhancements, and more. Here’s everything new in Android 16 QPR2! The best new customization options in Android 16 QPR2 Auto-themed icons If you want a more uniform home screen, you’ll want to enable Android’s Themed Icons feature. Introduced in Android 13, this feature tints app icons to match the system theme, creating a more visually cohesive look. Unfortunately, it relies on developers providing monochromatic versions of their icons. Since many developers haven’t done so, users are often left with a hodgepodge of themed and unthemed icons when the feature is turned on.",

Other recent leaks suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1.5K OLED screen. Motorola just rolled out the Edge 70 in global markets, but the company clearly isn’t slowing down. A new render shows what’s purported to be the first official image of the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra, hinting at where the next flagship is headed. The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70. The Motorola logo sits in the middle and seems to blend with each color, and the back texture looks more like something meant to add grip than decoration.",

This move contradicts Google’s previous rejection of a similar user request, where the company cited security risks and the sensitive nature of PII as reasons to keep the IMEI hidden on locked devices. While the feature could help law enforcement return lost or stolen devices without seizing or wiping data, it raises concerns that malicious actors could misuse the easily accessible identifier. Every single phone, Android or otherwise, has an IMEI number . The IMEI number is a unique identifier that identifies a device on a mobile network, much like a personal identification number. It’s generally a good idea not to reveal or broadcast your phone’s IMEI number, just to avoid sharing it with malicious actors. However, there are situations where easier access to a phone’s IMEI number might have been useful.

In fact, I originally switched to Android (Google Pixel 2 XL “panda edition,” which is still one of my favorite designs) specifically because I liked the images that Google’s camera app produced. Year over year, camera upgrades brought significant upgrades that — for me, at least — warranted buying a new phone each year. But in more recent years, the improvements have been less dramatic and, in many cases, not very noticeable to the average user. As someone who has continued to upgrade most years, this made me wonder how Google’s latest device stacks up against one of its predecessors , so I decided to compare the Pixel 8 Pro to my latest Pixel 10 Pro . Let’s dig into the pixels to see how a two-year-old device stacks up against Google’s latest efforts. Are you sure we’re using two different devices? Let’s start with the main camera . The lens itself is identical on both devices, so in theory, the images should be relatively similar.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s working up some new earbuds, and we’ve been expecting both the Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro. Last month we got an early look at the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design, and today that’s joined by our first Buds 4 imagery. Much like prior generations, the Pro model gets silicone tips absent on the base Buds. Technically, this is still Cyber Monday , but considering how so many Black Friday deals got started very early this year, we wouldn’t blame you if much of your holiday shopping has already concluded. But for those of you who were waiting, plenty of great deals still remain — like the one we just shared on Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro . While those are some fantastic earbuds, we’ve eagerly been looking forward to Samsung’s next generation, as well, and today we’ve got a new teaser to share with you.

That said, the gap isn’t as big as it used to be, but the good news is that there are plenty of solid T-Mobile deals that can still make it worth the switch. Whether you’re a new or existing customer, you’ll find trade-in offers, free device promos, and even occasionally free or heavily discounted lines. Below, we’ve rounded up the top promotions available heading into October of 2025 for phones, tablets, and smartwatches. While many of these offers might be similar to last month’s promotions, there are a few changes, including better offers on the iPhone 17 and a few other shifts.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Gemini has been working on a new “projects” option, much like ChatGPT already offers. Projects will allow you to sort files and chats around particular topics. After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.
