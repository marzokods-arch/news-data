Sadly, while it's possible to land on an enemy player's flying fighter jet— you should see that clip if you haven't already—Battlefield 6 won't let you take to the skies on a teammate's recon drone. Unless you hit it with a sledgehammer. The wildest glitch in Battlefield 6. Lmao. pic.twitter.com/A0k1I32mRd October 15, 2025 In the last 24 hours, clips have started circulating of players able to gain unparalleled verticality with a kind of bug that makes you wonder, \"What was the person who discovered this even doing?\" Typically, standing on a drone in BF6 doesn't achieve much: As soon as its controller moves it, you'll slide off. But as this clip from Charlie Intel demonstrates on X, standing on a stationary recon drone and clonking it with a sledgehammer causes an almost-definitely-unintended physics interaction that launches the drone and its surfer directly upwards. Because the motion isn't coming from the drone pilot's inputs, the rider is able to keep their footing. The drone will start drifting downwards after ascending, but in a delightful rejection of our earthly physics, the bug's repeatab…",

While I'll admit that last bit isn't often acknowledged by historical consensus, it is the basis for Tears of Metal, an upcoming hack-and-slash roguelike with a playable demo on Steam . It's a dark fantasy Dynasty Warriors following a legion of displaced Scots—a combination I didn't know I was missing, but one I'm happy to report is sick.

It's decked out in thick, sketchy comic book style, with scribbled highlights and streaks of effect accents punctuating the by-the-dozens dismemberment of hapless English footmen.

Today I'm going to put your brains and fingers to the test with our biggest quiz yet, and this one is all about game genres. According to the list I've pulled from Steamworks and SteamDB, there are over 130 different game genres and sub-genres that have their own tags on Steam. That's a whole lotta genres, so in the fill-in quiz below I've given you a full 15 gosh darn minutes to type as many of them as you can. They're in alphabetical order, which may help, and you can click the hint button if you want some clues. The concept of a genre, and Steam tags in general, can be a bit nebulous, and there are gonna be certain tags you might expect that aren't on the list, like \"VR\" or \"Cozy\" or \"Adult\"—which all sorta feel like they should be genres but are maybe more descriptors.

It's not until they start running the other way that you realise that their gamer tag isn't quite spelt right, and they never responded to your desperate cries asking what they were doing. The Invasion game mode basically takes these encounters and intensifies them, putting real players into each trial rather than NPCs.

Intel will launch a new GPU later next year that's purpose built for AI inferencing . And guess what? It's using that Xe3P graphics architecture. Specs-wise, other than the simple fact that the new GPU, codenamed Crescent Island, is using that next-gen Xe3P technology, there's little to go on. The only other detail is 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory. Actually, that's a relatively revealing spec as it implies this GPU will be a value play, at least in the context of megabucks AI chips. Were it aiming at top-tier AI performance, it would more likely use something along the lines of HBM or High Bandwidth Memory over a huge memory bus. Notably, there's no mention at all of Celestial, the graphics architecture that was supposed to follow Intel's current Battlemage tech , which was previously presented under the Xe3 brand and was equally absent from the Panther Lake launch , despite that chip getting Xe3 graphics. Anyway, Intel says that Crescent Island won't be out …",

Hell, it even runs like a dream . That's not to say the game's entirely without issues, of course, and one persistent grumble since launch has been about Conquest mode, which is arguably the series' 'main' mode and one you'll likely be spending a lot of time in. The problem is time itself: Conquest is a mode designed around each team having a set number of 'reinforcement tickets', which tick down as the match progresses—the first team to run out of tickets loses. Battlefield 6 added a timer to Conquest, something that wasn't present in previous Battlefield games, and so players have run into a repeated issue where matches are finishing before either team has run out of tickets. You can easily see why this is a problem. The great thing about Conquest is comebacks and how a declining ticket count affects your team: players notice when the number's getting low, play more cautiously, and every kill starts to feel…",

Once you figure out the specific rules and optimize your build, it’s perfectly doable. Here’s how to unlock the Hero Sword in Megabonk, and some tips on making the whole process a little easier. How to unlock the Hero Sword in Megabonk To unlock the Hero Sword in Megabonk, you’ll need to defeat a Stage Boss without: Picking up any items Using any power-ups Using any shrines (Image credit: Vedinad) Obviously, this means you should steer clear of interacting with Succ Shrines, Moai Shrines, Greed Shrines, Challenge Shrines, and Boss Curse Shrines. You should also avoid charging up any Upgrade Shrines, but you can accept any upgrades you get through leveling up. Without any items or power-ups, these level upgrades are totally essential for getting strong enough to handle a Stage Boss. To speed up the process, try taking out a Blue Skeleton for an instant level-up . Feel…",

Motorslice's demo has been out for a while now, but it was recently updated for Steam Next Fest . Its controls seem unwieldy at first, but they're mostly just demanding. Chainsaw-blade-wielding protagonist P controls a lot like Lara Croft in the early Tomb Raider games.

Forgive the Destiny jargon, because this thing loves an in-game currency, but unstable cores are how you infuse gear, increasing its power level beyond the seasonal cap. The problem with the currency was relatively simple though, to the extent you wonder how it ever released in this state: it cost huge amounts of cores to do more or less anything at higher levels, compared to the small amount you'd earn for dismantling loot. Anyone still playing Destiny 2, it's fair to say, is probably also running multiple builds, and so the problems with unstable cores quickly became exponential: the higher level infusions could add up to tens of thousands of cores. Bungie is now taking the opportunity, with the release of Destiny 2: Renegades on December 2, to correct its mistake. Having previously said it intended to \"rebalance the economy\" of unstable cores, it's now just admitting this was a bad idea all along. \"We have landed on a plan to fully deprecate this currency,\" says Bungie . \"Once deprecated, infusion…",

The Humbird 3 , as it is known, claims to be the world's first eGPU dock with Thunderbolt 5 support. That's critical, because Thunderbolt 5 offers 80 Gbps bi-directional bandwidth plus a 120 Gbps one-way \"Boost\" mode, the latter being designed to support multiple really high-res and high-refresh displays. So, the first question is, will Thunderbolt 5 and 80 Gbps of bi-directional bandwidth be enough to keep a modern GPU fed? After all, if it is, you could then turn any laptop with a Thunderbolt 5 port into a gaming machine. Er, right? That's actually a tricky question. The problem with eGPUs isn't just pure bandwidth; it's latency, too. The Humbird 3 has a full PCIe x16 slot for graphics cards, but it can't do the full x16 bandwidth by PCIe Gen 4 standards, let alone Gen 5.

My basic answers to those questions are usually 'Yes' and 'Yes'. Let me explain. For many years, my primary display was a 27-inch 4K 60 Hz TN Acer model that I bought over 12 years ago. It then became my secondary monitor when I got another Acer 27-inch 4K IPS screen , about seven years ago, this time with a 144 Hz refresh rate. The difference between the two was night and day, quite literally, as the older one's backlights were beginning to fade. Then, near the beginning of this year, I got my hands on the best OLED gaming monitor around, the MSI MPG 321URX . That's a 32-inch 4K display, with a 240 Hz refresh rate. Compared to the 4K 144 Hz Acer, it's notably better to work on and game with for many hours, and against the ancient 4K 60 Hz Acer, there's just no contest at all. If you're thinking about upgrading your display to an OLED, and you're currently using similarly old monitors, then you'll feel the same way as I did. Nothing beats OLED when it comes to eye-popping colours and blistering screen…",

But there's been talk (and specifically images) of MSI RTX 5090 graphics cards ending up in China, so MSI has just clarified that \"MSI has never officially sold or distributed the GeForce RTX 5090 in China.\" Amidst back-and-forth tariffs and restrictions in the US-China trade war over the last few months, there have been reports of big smuggling operations running restricted AI chips into China. For instance, earlier in the year a Financial Times investigation suggested at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs were shipped to China during strict export controls, and there have even been arrests in a different case regarding exports of \"tens of millions of dollars’ worth of sensitive microchips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications\" over the last three years.

ADATA's Chen Libai has said that supplies of all the major memory and storage technologies—DRAM, NAND, and HDD—are now in shortage. Chen says it's the first time that has happened in 30 years. The reason is clear enough: demand from AI. \"Our competitors in the fight for supply are no longer our peers, but giant CSPs (cloud service providers),\" Chen said. By way of example, OpenAI alone (yeah, it's always OpenAI) has signed a deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which is equivalent to 40% of current global DRAM output . Moreover, the AI-driven surge in demand is prompting manufacturers to prioritise production capacity for high-margin applications. Sound familiar? It's all rather too reminiscent of the GPU market for comfort, and we know what happened to graphics card prices in the last few years. Ouch.

But now, having played its (albeit too brief) demo, I am thrilled that it feels like it'll live up to my expectations. You play as Pon, a tanuki responsible for delivering mail across four bright, summery Japanese towns. As summer starts coming to a close though, the Tanuki Festival gets closer, and the shrine has been left in disrepair. With the pocket money you earn from your part-time job at the post office, alongside the minigames you can complete around the town, you can purchase decorations to make the shrine as magical as it should be before the festival. When you start the demo, your first task is stacking packages and letters into your bag which you then need to deliver.

Its cinematic take on World War II, and especially the Omaha Beach landing, earned it our Best Action Game of the Year award, and made it one of 2002's must-play games. The third in the Medal of Honor series, it had been farmed out to a new developer called 2015, Inc. Publisher Electronic Arts decided not to keep 2015 on for the inevitable follow-up, however, bringing the series in-house. Which left 2015 at a loose end. Having been given a tight deadline to crank out a franchise entry and then absolutely smashing it, the studio assumed it would be allowed a second chance. When EA decided not to keep them around, a chunk of 2015 including Allied Assault's development director Vince Zampella went to EA's rival Activision, started a new studio called Infinity Ward, and invented Call of Duty. If EA had kept them around, 2015 would presumably have happily kept making Medal of Honor games for them and Call of Duty wouldn't have become a thing. Or, to put it another way, \"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks,\" as Zampella recently told GQ Magazine . It's an incredible own-goal in the history of video…",

I haven't decided yet if that's because they're totally overpowered or if I'm just a dummy, but what I do know is that \"land mine spam\" is real. The current best practice for anti-tank mines, as far as I can tell, is to plaster absolutely every road, junction, and pile of dirt with cylindrical death traps and hope that drivers are too distracted to look out for them. It's working so far: Whether I'm driver, gunner, or a humble passenger, at least half of my tank and jeep escapades have ended with the sudden and frankly terrifying boom of a land mine. For example, this is what the average road on Mirak Valley looks like right now: Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: EA) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: EA) There are, of course, some countermeasures: Later tank unlocks include a mine sweeper function that will automatically spot hostile traps, but almost nobody has it right now.

According to Steam's charts , what's getting the most attention in the current Next Fest is an old tech demo for Half Sword. But really, can you blame anyone? Videogames are nothing if not proof of a near-universal fascination with the idea of people hitting each other with objects, and Half Sword's physics-based simulation of 15th century martial combat takes that grisly spectacle to a bloody, often clumsy extreme. (Image credit: Half Sword Games) Created in consultation with practitioners of Historical European Martial Arts, Half Sword aims for authentic representation of historical weaponry, armor, and techniques from historical combat manuals. And the results of when those hits land are simulated with similar realism, as evidenced by Half Sword's regular dismemberments and disembowelings. In my case, a few of those dismemberments have been self-inflicted.

There's the slow progression, the wonky server browser, the high CPU usage, and oh yea—there's something deeply wrong with hit registration. If your gun isn't always shooting straight, that's partly by design—Battlefield 6 guns have \"bloom,\" an accuracy penalty that increases bullet spread the longer you fire continuously. While some Call of Duty transplants are gobsmacked by the mechanic on principle, DICE is currently investigating instances where bloom is working a little too well. As no shortage of clips shared over the weekend reveal, sometimes guns just decide to be inaccurate at extremely close range , or at the beginning of a magazine when they should still be accurate. But there's a good chance that we're talking about multiple bugs disrupting accuracy, and it's probably not all bloom's fault.

Playing a Splinter Cell game as Sam Fisher, we're more than happy to spend hours slinking slowly through corridors and stairwells, crouching motionless for long minutes in the dark observing enemy patrol routes, and painstakingly carrying unconscious bodies into darkened corners to secrete them. But watching someone do that in an animated series? For 20 minutes at a time? It's hard to imagine that being gripping, which is probably why the stealth sequences in Netflix's animated series Splinter Cell: Deathwatch don't last all that long before transitioning into straight action. There's as much gunplay, knife fighting, and car-chasing in Deathwatch as there is sneaking and slinking around—which isn't really in the spirit of the Splinter Cell games.

And worried about Arc more generally. Along with a hill of other information on Panther Lake, Intel published a very confusing slide showing that the new chip's iGPU represents the first outing for its Xe3 graphics architecture. But that slide also indicated that Panther Lake's graphics will be branded \"B Series\", just like the Intel Arc B580 which uses Xe2 technology, otherwise known as (and indeed referred to in the slide in question) as Battlemage. Another oddity is that while the slide refers to both Xe2 and Battlemage, it only calls out Xe3 and not the \"Celestial\" generational codename that has previously been attached to Xe3.

Part of this was certainly thanks to other factors, such as the pandemic keeping people inside, meaning that many were looking for new ways to hang out with friends, but it's safe to say that Phasmo's success spurred on the appetite for co-op games we've seen recently, like Lethal Company or REPO .
