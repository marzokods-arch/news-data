Google told Android Authority that, effective 2026, Google will publish new source code to AOSP in Q2 and Q4.

Razer is pitching headphones as a new way to control AI, offering environmental awareness and support for major AI platforms, though it remains a concept with no product plans confirmed. Razer also showcased new AI-focused accessories at the event, including the Wolverine V3 BT controller designed for ultra-low-latency gaming on compatible LG TVs. Razer is no stranger to showing off cool concept ideas at trade shows like CES , including stuff like a high-tech facemask and a climate-controlled chair . This year, the company has something equally innovative to share in the form of Project Motoko. At first glance, you’d assume that these were simply a pair of Bluetooth headphones, but underneath you’ll find an incredible amount of AI-powered smarts.

Every company is indeed cramming AI into as many devices and form factors as possible, so I’d forgive you if your knee-jerk reaction is to write off Razer’s AI headphones (known as Project Motoko) as just more AI nonsense.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus is reportedly considering a “Pro” or “Ultra” model for the first time since 2022. Leaks suggest that the 2026 flagship will be an “all-rounder” that has evolved based on current customer feedback. The rumored device is expected to arrive in Q4 2026, in line with the company’s conventional yearly release cycle. OnePlus had an interesting 2025. The company started strong with the OnePlus 13, 13R, and 13s, but then came along the OnePlus 15 and 15R , which left behind some of the highlights of their predecessors. While the new phones are only a few months old at this point, leaks have already begun to emerge for the successor to the OnePlus 15, and it appears the company could right some wrongs this year.

While it’s understandable to restrict video playback to prevent it from distracting users, there’s no reason it should restrict playback when the car is stationary or has its ignition turned off. Google, if it wanted, could place curbs on watching videos when it detects the car in motion. It already does that by preventing users from using the physical keyboard to search for a destination in Google Maps when the vehicle is in motion, and instead only allows using voice for search.",

In addition to the already-leaked black and white colorways, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro may also come in an “Apricot” colorway. The special color appears limited to the Pro variant for now, with no hints for the regular model. Unlike its phones, which get updated every year, Samsung maintains a longer upgrade cycle for its premium wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 3 series was released nearly 18 months ago, which means the Galaxy Buds 4 should arrive soon. Although we aren’t clear on the timeline just yet, we’ve been seeing several references to the Galaxy Buds 4 and the Buds 4 Pro in Samsung’s One UI firmware for phones. While we recently learned about changes to the earbuds’ battery capacities and new head gestures , the recently released One UI 8.5 beta 3 provides more details.

Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series.

With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",
