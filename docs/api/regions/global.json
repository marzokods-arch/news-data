    "body": "One of the great injustices of Battlefield 6 is that the basic transport jeep is a useless piece of garbage. With four seats, one turret gunner, and absolutely zero protection from bullets or mines, taking a ride in Battlefield 6's sole transport car is like announcing to the entire server that five free kills are vroomin' their way soon. In well over 60 hours of Battlefield 6, I've had just a handful of excursions in the The Light Ground Transport (or LGT) that didn't leave me riddled with bullets or suddenly exploded. It is so bad at its one job—safely transporting—that it's not unusual to watch your team ignore a fleet of free jeeps and choose to hoof it across the map instead. The LGT is a failure. The Traverser Mark 2 , a new armored transport truck arriving in Battlefield 6 Season 1 , is its redemption. I took the Traverser for a handful of test drives during a preview session on the upcoming maps Eastwood and Blackwell Fields , and much like the maps themselves, I came away unable to imagine Battlefield 6 without it. The Traverser is the LGT's bigger, stronger, and meaner sibling. It seats just four total, so one less than the LGT, but it's also packing three times the fire…",

The price for a unique gun skin may well shoot into the stratosphere but, generally speaking, knives are the most sought-after commodity in the CS2 skin game. And until this update, you could only get a knife by either getting lucky when opening a case (with miniscule chances), or by straight-up buying one on the Steam community market.

That's the trouble Hades 2 ran into when it hit 1.0 earlier this month. As people brought over their progress and finished the game for its \"true ending\", the criticisms started stacking up. The Hades Reddit was flooded with threads discussing problems with how the story wraps up, so much so that the moderators asked users to only use neutral statements about it in their thread titles to avoid any hint of spoilers for those who hadn't seen it yet. Without spoiling anything here myself, I'll just say the main issue seemed to be about how abrupt it felt and that certain characters behaved in a way that didn't line up with the rest of the story. Basically, Hades 2 had a surprisingly tidy ending for a story about messy gods. The negative reactions must've been strong enough to prompt developer Supergiant Games to start working on a way to contextualize—not change—the ending. In its first patch since its release, Hades 2 will get \"true ending enhancements\" that add new events that lead up to it and a few following i…",

Mindhunter Season 3? Nah. Multiple shows based on a board game about sheep trading? Hell yes. \"They’ll be the first-ever screen adaptations of the global phenomenon,\" Netflix said, \"in which settlers navigate vast landscapes, forge shifting alliances, and compete for scarce resources as robbers roam the island.\" Vast landscapes? Shifting alliances? That's pretty dramatic talk for a game where people primarily trade wheat for wool and carefully lay out roads on a hex grid, isn't it?

Sadly, that's not how it works, and you won't find that peace in DVD Bounce World .

Game director Mark Roberts tells PC Gamer that there's a few reasons for that, but mostly it's a fear that not making something fresh—as Grinding Gear Games has always done—might disappoint its loyal players. But this time it \"just kind of felt right,\" Roberts says. In the Keepers of the Flame expansion, which arrives on October 31, PoE will return to Breach, a nine-year-old mechanic that is basically about killing monsters in a circle until time runs out. The simplicity of Breach will stay. Roberts stresses that the team wanted to be extremely careful about adding unnecessary complexity that might alienate its long-time fans. It will still involve touching a creepy hand and killing monsters inside of an expanding circle, but those monsters will have improved behavior thanks to tech that was worked on for the last Path of Exile 2 patch . And now there will be \"unstable\" breaches which call in a new boss to cap off the event. Endgame areas will spawn Breach Hives, which are fleshy cities you can raid and destroy for access to a new type of reward for PoE: The Genesis Tree. Eve…",

Duckov's got a surprising amount of depth under that parody appearance. Duckov developer Team Soda, a studio owned by China's Bilibili media platform, isn't resting easy on its laurels: Less than 24 hours after announcing its 1 million sales milestone, Team Soda has pushed a new update with a smattering of new features, balance adjustments, and bugfixes. Most of the changes are fairly mundane. Orange headphones can now be dismantled for materials; there's a new UI indicator for when the player's injured; dogs are now more of an early game terror thanks to their footsteps being silenced.

I'm going to go with the New Vegas package first, because I'm a sucker for big boxes and game statues: It does indeed come in a big box, and also carries a big price tag of $155 , plus whatever shipping costs are involved.

And yes, the game is in there too, although true old-timers may be disappointed: It's not a disc, but a download code for Fallout: New Vegas and its six expansions: Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road, Gun Runners' Arsenal, and Courier's Stash.

Thanks to new reporting from Bloomberg , we now have a clearer idea of the motivation for Microsoft's current gaming strategy—if it can be called that. According to sources familiar with the business, Microsoft executives have been pressuring the Xbox division to achieve profit margins well in excess of industry average. Bloomberg reports that in fall of 2023, Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood introduced a new target of 30% \"accountability margins\"—Microsoft's corporate euphemism of choice for profit margins—for the gaming division. In comparison, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that profit margins in the games industry have fallen from a recent height of 22% during the COVID lockdown years of 2020 and 2021 to an average of 17% in 2024.

But if you're not a fan of this pad's Xbox-style asymmetric sticks and button glyphs, Razer has another 'don't worry, I've got you' offering. Enter the Raiju V3 Pro , another wireless controller pitched towards the Esports scene but instead featuring symmetrical TMR sticks and PlayStation stylings. All for $220, which is $20 more than the latest iteration of the Wolverine. Sorry, what ? The TMR sticks contribute in part to that steep premium. For those unaware, the Hall effect is one magnetic tech that effectively banishes stick drift, and TMR (or tunnelling magnetoresistance) is another. The difference is that the way TMR leverages its electromagnetic sensors allows the controller's sticks to pick up really minute movements, making for a level of precision above even what the Hall effect can offer. Oh, and on the Raiju V3 Pro, you can swap in a long, long thumbstick topper for even more precise movement if that's your jam (though I'm not sure it's mine).

Per analyst firm Circana (via Gamesindustry.biz ), Borderlands 4 has Gearbox counting stacks for the foreseeable future: It was the number one US best-seller for the month of September (August 31 to October 3, to be specific). Not just that, but it's sold 30% more than Borderlands 3's debut, and stands as the fastest-selling game in the franchise's history. Exactly how many stacks is a different ballgame. Borderlands 4, according to Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, had more than twice the budget of Borderlands 3 (assuming he wasn't just being hyperbolic, which is always possible ). Whether or not these nippy sales are enough to categorise it as an unmitigated success for Pitchford are entirely dependent on what his studio's goals are. Also raising eyebrows are the fact that Borderlands 4 went on sale earlier this month. Past the cutoff point for Circana's data, mind, but given Pitchford's past words warn…",

I'm telling you this because I rather enjoy the running joke, which may soon be ruined by the Amazon Amelia smart glasses. Amazon has shown off the latest prototype of its AI-enhanced smart specs , designed to provide delivery drivers with not only a built-in camera (activated with a handy vest button) for delivery confirmation photos, but also a HUD that looks remarkably similar to the Fallout UI, complete with the iconic shade of neon green. (Image credit: Amazon) Amazon says the heads-up display can provide navigation details, flag hazards, and help drivers keep track of delivery tasks (via BBC News ). The HUD is turned off while said delivery driver is on the road, you'll be pleased to hear, but automatically activates as soon as they're safely parked at their delivery location. Delivery workers can then take advantage of the turn-by-turn navigation feature to guide them to the correct door, which looks a whole lot like a minimap in…",

And now Razer has launched the Raiju V3 Pro, available for purchase immediately, which looks to be a PlayStation-shaped answer to the Wolverine V3 Pro. It's a little strange calling it the V3 Pro, because as far as I can tell there was no Raiju V2 or V2 Pro, just the original Raiju, plus an Ultimate and Tournament edition . Still, I suppose it makes sense to name it V3 Pro to keep it in-line with the Wolverine V3 Pro, given it looks like it's essentially the same controller but in symmetrical PlayStation layout. It works with and is at least in part designed for use with the PS5, of course, but also for PC. In fact, on PC it reaches up to 2,000 Hz polling, which is twice what you get with the Wolverine V3 Pro, but obviously less than what you get on the 8,000 Hz Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC. You really don't need 8,000 Hz polling on a controller, though—heck, you don't even need it on a mouse. 1,000 Hz is usually fine, and 2,000 Hz is ideal. M…",

I've only played the now-vanished demo that was available during the Steam Next Fest and so my thoughts are based strictly on that, but based on my time with it the new game seems like a reasonably competent, utterly unremarkable Doom-style co-op shooter. And it is co-op, whether you like it or not: Even if you choose to play offline, you'll be in the company of bots who spout various bits of bad exposition about who they are and how they came to be there, and in most situations will also quickly take care of all the combat for you if you let them.

The first half of the game crescendos with a pair of classic Obsidian conversation boss fights, and I had a big, dumb smile on my face as I contemplated long, scrolling lists of dialogue options⁠—some available to me, some greyed-out—gated by different skills, background traits, quest choices, and even an out-of-the-way optional conversation I'd had over 10 hours previously. Since I had a ton of points in speech and had gone for nonviolent resolutions whenever possible, I was able to pull off a satisfying \" everybody lives! \" conclusion to this midgame climax.

Everything mostly plays out in text, accompanied by sparse art that's generally serviceable but sometimes rather poor, and basic, dead-eyed character models.

As reported by GamesRadar , Gamalytic estimates that almost 13,000 new entries have hit Steam since the beginning of this year, highlighted by Soulash developer Artur Smiarowski over on X . While it's not quite as many as 2024's total releases yet—last year saw a whopping 18,000 games come out—it's almost on par with 2023's 13,179 releases with a few months still to go. Over 13,000 games have been released on Steam this year so far.8% of the releases are estimated to have grossed over $100k.40% didn't see a return on their $100 release cost.We might have reached the peak of the indie gold rush last year. pic.twitter.com/QWejYdsyXn October 20, 2025 An unfortunate side effect of a crap ton of new videogames is that a large chunk will, inevitably, fall to the wayside. So many, in fact, that Smiarowski's post goes on to declare that roughly 40% of 2025 Steam games didn't even make enough money ($1,000) to recoup the $100 submission fee developers or publishers have to pay to get the game on Steam in the first pla…",

One blocker to that might be hesitation over the new bespoke version of Windows running on the handheld. However, it turns out the handheld can run Bazzite—a Linux OS extremely similar to SteamOS—and doing so actually improves performance. That's going by tech YouTuber Cyber Dopamine's ad-hoc testing (via Tom's Hardware ). They got Bazzite up and running and spoke to one of the operating system's devs who ironed out any bugs and got the OS running well on the ROG Xbox Ally X. The end result is an ROG Xbox Ally X that seems to offer a better handheld gaming experience, though only in the games that actually work on Linux, of course. Bazzite isn't SteamOS, but it runs Steam's Big Picture Mode on top of a custom Fedora Linux distribution, and looks and runs essentially the same as SteamOS, with some extra options and so on. That in itself is a point in its favour, by my books, because SteamOS is very simple to use—it's one of the reasons I rate the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS so highly. You also get performance improvements…",

But one of the enduring complaints about Siege X is that the shift to free-to-play has triggered a huge uptick in cheating. I caught up with Siege creative director Alexander Karpazis at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week. I asked if the team at Ubisoft Montreal expected cheating to surge to the extent that it did in June. \"We knew having free access that it could be a vector that is exploited,\" he said, \"and we were ramping up our R6 ShieldGuard. In a lot of ways it really did help, but we need to be faster when it comes to making sure that we stay one step ahead of cheat makers, too.\" Eliminating cheating entirely is impossible, I acknowledged, and Karpazis agreed. \"Absolutely.

He listed Tekken 1-5 as his \"most hated\" games and had public \"feuds\" with Tekken's Katsuhiro Harada and Devil May Cry's Hideki Kamiya. While working on 2005's Ninja Gaiden Black, he said that Devil May Cry 3 director Hideaki Itsuno—who went on to make DMC 4, 5, and Dragon's Dogma—\"did pretty well for a young guy\" and \"might make something even better next time.\" Behind the blustery facade, Itagaki seemingly respected his action game peers a great deal; roasting them was his way of projecting the image of a true Master Ninja. But as I tried to convey in my Ninja Gaiden 4 review , Itagaki's games were different from the ones his competitors were making. It wasn't just that they tended to be more challenging, but that they took themselves so seriously; the winking tone that Kamiya favored with DMC's Dante and later Bayonetta were nowhere to be found in Itagaki's games. His sense of humor was adding an easier \"Ninja Dog\" mode to Ninja Gaiden for players who died too many times on the first level. The most cosmically strange thing about Ninja Gaiden 4…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Steam reviews are an endless source of both information and amusement. Where else can you read a review from someone who has played a survival game for 35,000 hours before giving it a thumbs-down ? Or, for that matter, find a glowing review of an MMO someone has played for less than an hour? But the best Steam reviews, for my money, are the ones where a player hammers out a review that encapsulates an entire game in just a few words, like the one in the image above by Steam user \"Cyber Lesbian\" for Marvel Rivals. Short reviews are like mini-poems, really, and even when they're silly they can still tell you a lot about game. I put a quiz together a few weeks ago to challenge you to identify 10 games based only on a blurb from a Steam review . It went over well, so we're doing it again! In the quiz below, see if you can guess the game based on a short Steam review . And let us know how you scored in the comments: overwhelmingly positive, or mostly negative?",

Its in-game description suggests it'll be given away as a free store gift. \"'Grounded skins for a while'— 18 days exactly,\" wrote Reddit user Ohforfk. \"Colorful weapons with pictures, colorful camos with neon accents, weird mix of things that are supposed to look cool, but end up simply weird.\" Such is the general tenor of responses in the thread: the lies of EA, doomer talk of Battlefield 6 going all downhill from here, and dunking on the skin itself, which is quite ugly.

Cards Against Humanity purchased the plot of land, located near the border between the US and Mexico, in 2017 to protest (and, one would assume, hinder) the erection of a wall between the two countries. In 2023, a local homeowner noticed that SpaceX was using the site for building materials and heavy equipment and brought it to CAH's attention, after which SpaceX gave CAH a \"12-hour ultimatum to accept a lowball offer\" for the land. Instead, CAH sued. The settlement came shortly before the case went to trial, which was scheduled to happen on November 3. CAH told AP that SpaceX copped to trespassing during the discovery phase, but it opted to settle because a trial \"would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX.\" Beyond that, CAH said \"the upside is that SpaceX has removed their construction equipment from our land and we’re able to work with a local landscaping company to restore the …",
