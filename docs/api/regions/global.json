The case hinged on the “conversion” of cellular data purchased from mobile carriers, specifically, which plaintiffs argued is their property. Google will pay out $135 million to affected users and make adjustments to Android behavior and terms of service. Google has agreed to pay $135 million to settle a class action suit over “appropriating” Android users’ mobile data. The suit accused Google of harvesting Android user data over cellular connections without their consent, including at times when Google’s apps were closed on those users’ devices. As reported by Reuters , a preliminary settlement was filed Tuesday night and is pending approval from a judge. Assuming there aren’t any last-minute changes, anyone in the US (outside of California) who’s accessed the internet using a cellular network on an Android device since November 12, 2017 will be eligible to claim part of the settlement.",

It goes further than many novelty ring watches by adding health and fitness tracking. At $49.99, it’s cheap enough to be a weird gift, and even has a “couple interaction mode.” Smart rings have been edging closer to smartwatches for a while now, but Rogbid has taken a more literal approach. The company has just launched the Rogbid Fusion, a device that looks like a smartwatch shrunk down into ring form, complete with a screen, health tracking, and even the option to wear it on your wrist instead. Rogbid isn’t a big name in wearables, but it’s been selling budget smart devices for years. As spotted by The Verge , the Fusion is now available from Rogbid’s online store for $49.99. That’s far cheaper than most ring watches, and it comes in gold, silver, and black finishes.",

Just over a week into the New Year, Trinbagonian soca superstar Kes delivered a pair of knockout headlining performances at the Unity Jazz Festival. Gracing NYC&#8217;s esteemed Jazz at Lincoln Center (Jan. 8-9), the consummate performer bridged his biggest hits with swing jazz, bringing out award-winning trumpeter (and fellow Trini!) Etienne Charles as a special guest. Two weeks later, Jamaican dancehall star Chronic Law stormed the headlines with the news of his alleged detainment by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to Complex , Chronic (born Ackeme Campbell) was listed “in ICE custody&#8221; without any additional information immediately available (Jan. 15).

Later that year, he returned for two more months on the stadium upgrade, World’s Hottest Tour.

In December, Bad Bunny kicked into full gear with eight dates, split between a pair in San Jose, Costa Rica, and six in Mexico City. According to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, those December shows grossed $99.1 million and sold 633,000 tickets, making him the highest-grossing and best-selling touring act of the month.

The crowd forms a constellation of individuals united by the electric, ineffable thrill of belonging to something greater than themselves. The magic is only amplified by Styles’ sequined jumpsuit.

    "body": "A new image from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope of a portion of the Helix Nebula highlights comet-like knots, fierce stellar winds, and layers of gas shed off by a dying star interacting with its surrounding environment. Webb’s image also shows the stark transition between the hottest gas to the coolest gas as the shell expands out from the central white dwarf. NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI; Image Processing: Alyssa Pagan (STScI) NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has zoomed into the Helix Nebula to give an up-close view of the possible eventual fate of our own Sun and planetary system. In Webb’s high-resolution look, the structure of the gas being shed off by a dying star comes into full focus. The image reveals how stars recycle their material back into the cosmos, seeding future generations of stars and planets, as NASA explores the secrets of the universe and our place in it. In the image from Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), pillars that look like comets with extended tails trace the circumference of the inner region of an expanding shell of gas. Here, blistering winds of fast-moving hot gas from the dying star are crashing into slower moving colder shells of dust and gas that…",

It allows you to log in to your Epic Games account to browse and download games on your Android device. Support is still experimental, and multiplayer games are not working. The age of PC emulation on Android is upon us, with new translation layers and software allowing you to play Steam games on your phone or Android gaming handheld without any fuss. Now, for the first time, you’ll also be able to play titles from the Epic Games Store library, thanks to a nightly update from GameNative. And if you’re like me, that amounts to literally hundreds of free games claimed over the years. While support is still experimental, the setup is fairly straightforward. After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration. From there, it will open a browser where you can log in to your Epic Games account. Then, you need to copy an authentication key, paste it into GameNative, and it should automatically populate your game list (give it a minute if you have 500+ games like me).",

Multiple users on Reddit have confirmed that issues with their Galaxy Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic have resolved. The update also brings the January 2026 security update. The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",

The REDMAGIC 11 Pro is one of the last gaming phones on the market (and our top pick for the best gaming phone ), but now it’s set to get a cheaper, more pocketable sibling. The REDMAGIC 11 Air is a slightly slimmed-down version of the 11 Pro, but not by much. The company writes that it’s “12% thinner and 10% lighter” than its larger sibling, with the same 6.85-inch 144Hz AMOLED panel. It’s still roughly as thick as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra at 8mm, but the flat back means there’s no camera bump to get in your way while you game.",

Instead, it will focus on its Phone 4a series and audio products. Pei says the decision is backed by the intensifying competition to acquire smartphone components. The Nothing Phone 3 can be classified as less than a success. While it excelled in terms of fun, quirky features , the Phone 3 did not thrive in terms of practicality or value. Despite its novelty, the non-flagship chipset and an $800 price tag easily made the phone feel impractical . And Nothing appears to have taken the verdict to the heart, to the effect that it is taking 2026 to mull over flagships instead of releasing one. In a recent video shared on the official Nothing YouTube channel, co-founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship phone in 2026. This could be a shocker for Nothing fans, as it seemingly was for the staff member speaking with Pei on the talk show.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Global smartphone chipset shipments are expected to fall 7% in 2026, but industry revenue is still set to grow in double digits. AI-driven data center demand is pushing chipmakers toward high-margin HBM, driving up DRAM prices and squeezing phone makers. Budget phones under $150 are taking the biggest hit as rising costs make low-end devices harder to sustain. The smartphone industry is facing a paradox. Counterpoint Research reports that global smartphone chipset shipments will drop by 7% in 2026. Normally, fewer shipments would mean trouble for the industry , but this time, manufacturers are still expected to see double-digit revenue growth. So, why are shipments dropping? Part of the reason is the growing demand from data centers . As AI becomes more common, chipmakers are shifting their resources to produce high-margin HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for large server farms. This shift has caused DRAM prices to rise sharply, making it harder for manufacturers to create affordable phones without taking a loss.",

While the update was initially rolled out on January 12 , many users reported not receiving it until earlier this week. More than a thousand Android Authority readers also corroborated this in a recent survey. Thankfully, it appears Google may have finally ironed out what was causing the delay. We’re seeing new reports from multiple Pixel owners on Reddit confirming they finally received the January update. Reddit user Different_Dinner8195 recently posted in the Google Pixel subreddit, declaring they were finally able to download and install the update on their Pixel 10 Pro.

Windows Insiders can now resume Spotify playback, browsing sessions, and more. The presence of Cross-Device Resume on the Release Preview Channel suggests a rollout could be imminent. Back in 2025, Microsoft introduced an Apple Handoff-like feature for Windows called Cross-Device Resume . This feature lets users switch from their Android device to their PC to resume their app activity. For example, if you were using OneDrive on your Android phone, you could pick up where you left off when you switch to your PC.

The company says the issue affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under rare conditions. Manual and automatic Call Screen still work, and callers can continue using standard carrier voicemail instead. Most recent Pixel features have been welcome additions, but one meant to handle missed calls has instead caused a bit of a privacy snafu. Over the past few months, some users reported that callers could hear background audio during missed calls, rather than being cleanly prompted to leave a message. Google has now confirmed the issue and says it’s disabling Take a Message on the affected devices. In a post on its support forums , Siri Tejaswini, a Google community manager, said the company investigated the reports and confirmed they affect “a very small subset” of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under “very specific and rare circumstances.” Out of caution, Google is disabling Take a Message and its next-generation Call Screen features on those phones.",

AI-generated images just found a new canvas: your wall. SwitchBot’s latest isn’t a robot or a smart lock. It’s a collection of E Ink picture frames that double as always-on AI art displays. On the hardware side, the frames feature E Ink Spectra 6 technology, designed to mimic the layered look of real paint on real paper. As with other E Ink displays, the result is glare-free, backlight-free, and easy on the eyes, making it better suited as wall art than an LCD or OLED screen. Through the SwitchBot app, users can upload and organize artwork, store up to 10 images locally, sync new content, and schedule images to cycle on and off at given times of day. The frames are available in 7.3-inch, 13.3-inch, and 31.5-inch builds, each of which supports both horizontal and vertical orientations.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 series’s launch pricing may be the same as last year’s S25 series, at least in some markets. This is contrary to earlier reporting that suggested increased RAM prices would lead to higher S26 prices for consumers. The leak in question deals with pricing in Euros, and we can’t be totally sure what it means for US pricing. RAM prices have been soaring in recent months , a trend that’s caused product delays and fueled concern that new consumer electronics of all kinds will see reduced memory, higher sticker prices, or both. It was reported in November that the upcoming Galaxy S26 series was likely to see a RAM-induced price hike versus last year’s S25 phones, but a new leak suggests that might not be the case. Leaker Roland Quandt posted today on Bluesky that pricing for S26 base models will be “pretty much the same” as the S25 at launch, at least in European markets. His post goes on to say that the S26 Ultra may actually be less expensive, coming in about “100 Euro cheaper for 256 and 512GB” models, though he’s expecting the one-terabyte version’s pricing to remain the same.",

For all the places Gemini has popped up since its inception, probably one of the most powerful has been in our browsers. And beyond just using them to access Gemini’s home on the web, last year we started seeing Google bake Gemini right into its Chrome browser . Now, in early 2026, Google’s only strengthening the connection between Gemini and Chrome, delivering a new side-panel Gemini view and integrating the utterly fantastic Nano Banana.

With Gemini in the sidebar, Chrome will soon let you access information from other Google apps and services using “Personal intelligence.” Gemini in Chrome will also be able to perform tasks in other apps, such as Gmail, without opening them in a separate tab. For nearly two decades since its launch, Google Chrome has been the dominant choice as a web browser for most users. While that remains statistically true to date, newer browsers, such as Comet, Dia, and Opera Neon, have challenged its supremacy with agentic browsing . After months of teasing through other apps , Google is stepping up Chrome’s game with agentic capabilities that will browse the web — click links, scroll pages, type, and not just pull information — for you. And with this, Gemini in Chrome is also on its way to being more personalized. Google recently rolled out Personal Intelligence to Gemini across its mobile apps and the web interface. The function allows Gemini to pull context from different Google apps, including Gmail, Photos, and more, and combine it with your chats and recent history to give you bet…",

The object, known as JADES-ID1 for its location in the “JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey” (JADES) has a mass about 20 trillion times that of the Sun. Astronomers classify JADES-ID1 as a “protocluster” because it is currently undergoing an early, violent phase of formation and will one day turn into a galaxy cluster.

Paying for a standalone speaker seemed like a luxurious upgrade then, not a necessity. But after moving to my new home a year ago, I missed this setup. My glass-enclosed shower blocks most of the sound coming from my phone; even with the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s louder speaker and the trick of using corners to amplify sound, I couldn’t hear it clearly in the shower. So I started looking for options from Soundcore, JBL, Tribit, Bose, and others, and eventually made an impulse buy in the unlikeliest of places: the IKEA home electronics section.",

WHOOP responded by sending its Body apparel collection, which conceals the tracker within undergarments, to players, though using them still risks violating competition regulations. WHOOP makes one of the most interesting fitness trackers around, focusing entirely on strain, recovery, and long-term performance rather than on-wrist features, to the point that it does not even have a display. It’s a niche device that works out well for athletes who want deeper insights into their bodies.

Despite policies against sexual nudity, these apps were distributed through the app stores. Many of the apps generated significant revenue from in-app purchases, of which the platforms take as much as a 30% cut. Many of these apps were removed following the report, but several are still available for download. AI is one of the most powerful tools available these days, and you can do so much with it. But, like any tool, it can be used for good or bad . Over the past few weeks, we’ve witnessed social media users using X’s Grok AI chatbot in lewd ways, primarily to create sexualized imagery of women without their consent. As it turns out, it’s not just Grok that has been at the center of this undressing scandal, as both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store allegedly hosted “nudify” apps. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Phone 4a Pro gets a subtle increment in the battery, but retains the same 50W charging speed. The other big improvement is the water protection rating, now IP65. Unlike the more premium Phone 3, which largely disappointed with its inflated pricing, Nothing’s Phone 3a and the 3a Pro impressed with their high value proposition and features absent from mid-range phones. Naturally, the successors, Nothing Phone 4a and Phone 4a Pro, have big shoes to fill. We expect the series to come with reasonable upgrades without a significant price increase, and a recent leak proves this assumption may be partially true. The Nothing Phone 4a Pro has been on the horizon for several months now. After the Phone 4a and 4a Pro first appeared back in September , some of their specifications were tipped last month alongside hints of a new affordable headphone from the brand. A more recent leak now reveals the charging speed and the slightly increased battery capacity.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR McAfee’s latest Scam Detector update focuses on stopping scams before you click, scan, or reply. Real-time QR code scanning is a major upgrade, helping users avoid fake login pages and malware-filled sites instantly. Improved social message analysis makes it easier to catch scams that look like normal conversations. Online scams keep getting more advanced and harder to notice. Scammers use tricks like fake QR codes on restaurant tables and urgent messages from hacked social accounts to blend in with daily digital life. McAfee wants to tackle this growing problem with a new update to its Scam Detector service. McAfee just announced big improvements to its Scam Detector tool, like instant QR code scam checks and better protection for social messaging apps. Now, instead of only reacting after a scam happens, the software helps right when you’re about to click, scan, or reply. If you’ve ever paused before clicking a strange link or scanning a code in public, this update is meant for you.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR A Redditor is building a new version of Snake for Galaxy Watch, and it already looks better than most Wear OS alternatives. Bezel controls and a circular playfield make it feel natural on a smartwatch. The game isn’t finished or publicly available yet, but it’s a promising proof of concept. Like many of you, I’m old enough to remember when the Nokia 3210 was the phone to have, and Snake was the game everyone played. It was ultra simple and brutally addictive. As far as we’ve come with mobile gaming, it’s hard to match the nostalgia of those halcyon days, especially on a smartwatch . That’s why a recent post on Reddit’s Galaxy Watch community caught our attention. A developer going by JackGrylls shared an early build of a Snake-style game made specifically for Galaxy Watch and Wear OS, aiming to bring back the feel of the old bezel-controlled version they remember from the Tizen days.",

In recent weeks, we’ve seen credible rumors about color options , storage configurations , materials , and more. Today, a new rumor says we should expect a fairly significant display upgrade. Samsung’s 2025 Galaxy S lineup uses display panels with 8-bit color depth, which are capable of reproducing about 16.7 million discrete colors. Prolific leaker Ice Universe tweeted this morning that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will feature a 10-bit panel, drastically increasing the number of colors the phone’s screen can display.",
