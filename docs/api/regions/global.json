In addition to the many honorees who were in attendance, stars such as Questlove, Jennifer Hudson, Raye and LL Cool J were also present, many of them walking the red carpet at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles before watching and/or taking part in the programming. Fans then saw modern A-listers including Olivia Rodrigo and Chappell Roan help welcome their personal idols into the hall&#8217;s hallowed ranks, with the former rocking out alongside Feist to honor the Stripes, and the latter singing &#8220;True Colors&#8221; and giving a speech to fete Lauper.

    "body": "Taylor Swift ’s “The Fate of Ophelia” towers over all competition on the Billboard Hot 100 for a fifth week, encompassing its entire run on the chart so far. Of the superstar’s 13 career Hot 100 No. 1s, “The Fate of Ophelia” is her third to have led for at least five weeks. It joins “Anti-Hero” (eight weeks, beginning Nov. 5, 2022) and “Blank Space” (seven, Nov. 29, 2014). Meanwhile, following Halloween, Michael Jackson posthumously makes history on the Hot 100 as “Thriller” blasts from No. 32 to No. 10. With the song, which hit No. 4 in 1984, the late King of Pop becomes the first artist ever to rank in the top 10 in six distinct decades (the ‘70s, ‘80s, ‘90s, 2000s, ‘10s and now ‘20s). Check out the full rundown of this week’s Hot 100 top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations.

This might allow for better thermal performance, camera improvements, or improved battery life. The Galaxy S26 isn’t expected to launch until February, but leaks have continued to flow in at a steady pace. Earlier today, the Galaxy S26 Plus leaked in its iPhone 17 Pro-esque orange hue. Right along with the bigger sibling, we’re also witnessing the regular Galaxy S26 leak in digital renders. This isn’t the first time we’ve witnessed the Galaxy S26 leak. The difference, however, is that back when we first saw these renders, it was expected to be called the Galaxy S26 Pro as part of Samsung’s intended reshuffle for the lineup. However, with Samsung correcting course and returning to the original lineup , we’re now expecting the smaller model to release as Galaxy S26 — sans the “Pro” suffix.",

As OnePlus prepares to launch the OnePlus 15 globally, it has given us access to the device. While we work on a detailed review for you to see soon, we’re bringing you a quick unboxing experience of the OnePlus 15.

The credit card may offer cashback, which can be redeemed against Samsung products, including phones. In addition to the card, Samsung is also said to be exploring financial products such as high-yield savings, digital prepaid accounts, and BNPL. One of the significant perks of owning an iPhone is that you walk into a seamless ecosystem of convenience. While many people feel suffocated by the walled garden, others appreciate how easy it makes their lives. For instance, iPhone users in the US can apply for an Apple Card, a credit card that is designed primarily for use with Apple Pay on Apple devices. Android doesn’t have a competing product, but it seems that could soon be changing as Samsung is in talks to launch its own co-branded consumer credit card in the US.

The Galaxy S26 Ultra is also staring at an imminent price increase. The Galaxy S26 series has been a hot topic of discussion, more so than recent Galaxy S series flagships.

You can actually see the phone’s blue coolant circulating through the whole system. The RedMagic 11 Pro uses an unfreezable, server-grade fluorinated liquid and a piezoelectric micropump to move coolant through a loop. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro , Nubia’s brand-new gaming phone, is already one of the most eye-catching Android flagships right now. However, it turns out that the phone’s hidden liquid cooling system might just be its most jaw-dropping feature. In a new YouTube Short, JerryRigEverything’s Zack Nelson peeled back the rear cover of the phone to show what’s concealed underneath, and it’s unlike anything we’ve seen before.",

That’s why Android offers two levels of location accuracy: Precise and Approximate. These options are controlled by two different Android permissions and are intended for different kinds of apps. If an app requests a precise location, Android provides the most accurate estimate it can, usually within 3 to 50 meters (about 10 to 164 feet). If an app requests an approximate location, however, Android will only provide a rough estimate of your device’s location, which may only be accurate to within 3 square kilometers (about 1.2 square miles). This is why navigation apps always require your device’s precise location, while most other apps can function perfectly well with either.",

Over the years, most of us of a certain vintage have built our music libraries piece by piece, from rare digital downloads and fan remixes to songs that never made it to streaming platforms. Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option. Way too many of them don’t exist anywhere in the digital domain. Not on Spotify, not on Apple Music, and all too often, not even on YouTube.",

That’s the entire purpose of a smartwatch for me. While my watch can track everything from my broken sleep to biking laps — you know, the calories I burn — without me lifting a finger, it can’t as seamlessly track the calories that go into me. I’ve always struggled with nutrition tracking. Even though dozens of apps let you log your daily meals, the friction remains. The only wearable that could bridge this wide gap in fitness tracking, I foresee, is smart glasses. And even though I’m not too fond of making every wearable “smart,” if glasses could handle nutrition tracking for me, I’d happily throw my wallet at them.",

Last week, I wrote an opinion about the current state of Verizon , as well as some of the moves it might need to make to right the ship. I also mentioned it seemed obvious that store closures would be part of this process and that Verizon’s situation would likely get worse before it got better. It seems this may be happening sooner rather than later, as rumors of imminent closures are flying around on online communities like Reddit and The Layoff. Likewise, a few publications have also picked up on the rumors, such as Phone Arena . Is there any truth to the rumors, and if so, how big a cull are we talking about?

This data will be sent back to Google, which will use it to optimize results before a broader launch. Users will also be able to try out new hypertension alerts and receive $25 as compensation. Google’s Pixel Watch 4 appears to be significantly lacking in features compared to the Galaxy Watch 8 , particularly in terms of health-related metrics. That said, Google is working to plug this gap and is experimenting with two new features that will warn users of any looming illnesses. These features are currently under trial with Fitbit Labs, and a small group of users can participate in testing them ahead of others. With an upcoming update, some Pixel Watch users may be able to highlight any concerning deviations in their vitals. According to 9to5Google , a new feature called “Unusual Trend Detection” has been added to Fitbit Labs , a program that allows users to evaluate new features before they are rolled out to a broader user base.",

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

Samsung’s latest Z Fold 7 moved away from the under-display selfie cameras previous models used. Apple’s first foldable could launch in the second half of 2026. Smartphone manufacturers tend to get ideas from each other. Once Samsung or Google or Apple proves an idea is technically viable and, more importantly, marketable, the other players often move to implement it in their own products. Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display. We first heard that the foldable iPhone would feature an under-display camera by way of a May leak . Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones used similar technology through the Z Fold 6 until switching to a more conventional hole-punch design in the Z Fold 7.

That’s where pinned conversations come in handy, keeping your most important threads at the top of your inbox so they don’t get buried under new ones.

Having used it for over two years, I can confirm that it alters — in a good way — how you approach the app drawer. I now install it on all the phones I review and strongly recommend it too. However, there’s one aspect that keeps me from feeling completely satisfied, which is the limitation of using wallpapers of my choice. The launcher’s peculiar design for the app list makes it difficult to use visually rich wallpapers, but this issue may be getting addressed with a new update. In July, the developers of the launcher introduced a new theme playground , enabling users to experiment with various clock styles, wallpapers, and colors.

On the plus side, I’d been looking for an excuse to test out the dedicated “Fireworks” mode in the OnePlus 13 and OPPO Find X8 Pro (I’m using the latter) camera apps. The mode seems to combine long and short exposures, providing vivid detail with well-exposed lighting and colors.
