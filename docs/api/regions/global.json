They’re cinematic platformers in the Inside mould, but they tell you nothing and rely entirely on implication. As far as we know, our freakish little protags have been on the run from diabolical terrors forever.

Absolum seems to be delivering that—earlier this year I called the game one of my favorite things I've played in 2025 . Out tomorrow, I spoke with some of Absolum's developers at Dotemu about their creative process behind the cast of four: Galandra (broadsword-swinging warrior), Karl (stout dwarven brawler), Cider (the prosthetic ninja), and Brome (frog wizard). PC Gamer: What was the top-level, guiding idea in designing Absolum's characters? Maxime Mary, art director and co-creative lead: As Dotemu used to reinvent old IPs for contemporary players, we looked at old fantasy games like Golden Axe or Dungeons and Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara as a starting point and looked at how we could modernize them. So the four playable characters had to have this “classic” vibe. We have the dwarf, the warrior, the magician, the rogue, but we wanted to have something that fits more with our modern culture.

There are plenty of potential suspects you can point the finger at, and you have to choose one whether you've got damning evidence or not. Spoiler: you will never have damning evidence. Regardless of who you send under the headsman's axe, you'll always have a queasy feeling that they might not be the one who did it. In a chat with PCG at this year's GDC, Pentiment director Josh Sawyer said that's entirely the point. \"From the very beginning I said, 'I think that for this to be compelling in the way that I want it to be, there cannot be a right answer'\". In fact, it sounds like Sawyer himself doesn't have a clear culprit in mind for the game's evildoings. \"People on the team would ask me [who the culprit is], then people at Xbox would ask me, and I'm like, 'No! There isn't!'

Battlefield games have a rather unfavourable track record of borking their servers on launch as more people than expected pile in. To be fair, so do most multiplayer online games. But Battlefield 6 lead producer David Sirland seems to think all will be OK when Friday rolls around. \"Should be! We are planning for that, of course, and the open beta helped gauge the interest as well,\" Sirland said (via GamesRadar ) in response to a fan question about whether the servers would be ready. (Image credit: EA) The betas likely helped Battlefield Studios realise just how popular Battlefield 6 will be, as hundreds of thousands of players piled in to experience the joys and horrors that Iberian Offensive had to offer, and many were met with a 140,000 player queue . The other pitfall that many were nervous about Battlefield 6 falling into is releasing in an unoptimised state (like Borderlands 4 last month ). Although from wha…",

But that punishing permadeath for everything the sandworm swallows has been de-fanged, at least a little bit: a new patch for Funcom's survival MMO means that you don't have to lose your vehicle forever even if it goes down a sandworm's gullet. There's a catch, however.

Our Dave has reviewed a very similar model and likes the value proposition you get when you take into account that mega GPU, although it is a bit of a hairdryer on full whack.

And now Blizzard has turned its attention back towards them as Diablo 4's second expansion is on the horizon. Diablo 4's two methods of crafting—if you can call them that—stick out as features that solved necessary problems at the time, but are now more of a nuisance than anything. Blizzard added tempering and masterworking to keep loot from feeling static. Both systems give any piece of gear the potential to be an upgrade by letting you customize what stats are on them and how powerful they are. The problem is that both of them are based purely on luck. Let me tell you, spamming an upgrade button to see if you got the right result is not particularly fun, especially when you're doing it for every piece of gear you own. It's even worse when it's …",

Your tools let you deform the alien planet, too: tunneling through the ground, building land bridges to cross gaps, and aiming water nozzles to \"de-goop\" important scientific equipment that the local fauna has gummed up. When a mission has been completed, you return to the space station and prepare for the next expedition.

I've been on multiple trains in the past year and I've only rarely had to open fire on anyone. So I was sceptical leading up to my hands-on time with Red Rover Interactive's Enginefall, which is in essence a Dune: Awakening-ish take on Snowpiercer . I might still be a little sceptical, but I see the vision now. Romping about the game's carriages with ad-hoc armaments, getting the drop on other players, and seeing the ruined world zip by out the window: it works better than it maybe should, and provides ample space for you and other players to gin up temporary, make-do alliances that you betray the nanosecond it becomes profitable.

That 'beats' the previous low of 18,023 back in the doldrums of Revenant—the last expansion cycle's worst episode. It's worth remembering that peak daily concurrents offer us a very limited picture: The number of players simultaneously in-game during Destiny 2's busiest period. It doesn't tell us how many players actually logged into the game over the course of the day. Nor does it tell us what the game's population is on other platforms.

The Havn style introduced with the HS 420 is still going strong with the BF 360. A style that's very appealing to me, personally, with rounded corners and long vents for increased airflow through the front and top panels and down the rear of the chassis.

In other words, OLED can only hit those kinds of numbers for very small highlights, with full screen brightness only recently breaking the 300 nit barrier. But this TCL display can do 1,400 nits full screen. It's not clear whether the 1,600 nit spec TCL claims is sustained full-screen brightness or limited by aperture or time.

I understand those PlayStation folks are enjoying Ghost of Yotei (assuredly PC-bound at some point). Games like Manor Lords, or Hunt: Showdown, or good ol' Crusader Kings also let us live out our dreams of distant and alternate pasts. Problem is, of course, the frogs. Are devs really telling me that, in an age of Unreal Engine 5, lumen and nanite-ified whatevers, game creators can't do better than a frog that's clearly seen an iPhone before? Atrocious stuff, but fear not, because the devs making Hell Let Loose: Vietnam—follow up to 2021's World War 2 shooter that shifts the action to, well, Vietnam—know just how immersion-breaking an anachronistic frog can be. In a chat with PC Gamer magazine, creative director Matt White said the team are taking historical authenticity incredibly seriously. \"All of it is a hundred-percent historically authentic,\" said White, pointing out \"All the uniforms or the weaponry, the environment,\" even \"the clothes you see on the floors\" as being appropriate for the time and place of the game's setting.

You could colour any game with various hues and douse it in virtual glitter and heart icons, and it would probably pique my interest in some way or another.

That perception dramatically changed, I reckon, around the time of massively multiplayer Curiosity: What's Inside The Cube . It was a game in which, well, a lot of players all tapped on a cube, removing layer after layer until they eventually hit the centre. Molyneux promised the prize for the single player who reached that centre would be \"life-changing\". It turned out to be the role of 'God of gods' in Molyneux's then-upcoming game Godus, plus 1% of the game's revenue. The winner—an 18-year-old named Bryan Henderson—never got any money, and told Eurogamer that he was largely forgotten by Molyneux's studio after a single visit to its office in 2015. Fast forward to today, and an interview with the most recent issue of Edge magazine, and Molyneux seems contrite about the whole saga, but I don't know that he's learnt the right lessons.

I adore this game, I swear I do, but boy could it have used a trim. It turns out at least one member of the original dev team agrees. In a conversation with FRVR , Alien Isolation writer Dion Lay demonstrates that the outsize length of the game wasn't deliberate at all: it was because the Xenomorph AI got way too good. In Alien Isolation, the Xenomorph has more sophisticated AI than is still the norm in horror games. Whereas the indestructible stalking characters in Resident Evil tend to always behave the same, the Xenomorph can adapt to player behaviour and is thus a far more formidable opponent. It's why Alien Isolation is still unmatched when it comes to cat-and-mouse style horror, but it also serves to make the player behave more carefully and thus, slowly. In other words: a story that unfolded at a faster clip with less-sophisticated AI became much longer. “The Alien really evolved as we were making it,” Lay said.…",
