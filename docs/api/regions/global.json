One icon reads \"Cross-Buy\", while the second reads PS5/PC. \"New Symbols will be added soon (website & tool), but here [are] some nice new features from PlayStation\", Amethxst wrote. \"A kind of 'echo mode' 'PS5/PC games' and 'Cross-Buy'.\" While this initial post was difficult to verify, later, Amethxst followed this up with a video , in which they locate the symbols within the PS5's user menu, and it is much more convincing. Elsewhere, a French website Dealabs (via Gamespot ) provided further evidence of the symbols' authenticity, discovering the words \"crossbuy-tag\" within some CSS files on the PlayStation Store. Since the term \"Cross-Buy\" has been used by Sony since the PS-Vita days, Dealabs also checked when the new symbols were added to the store, and discovered they first appeared in June this year. Sony has yet to confirm the authenticity of these symbols. But PC/PS5 cross-buy would certainly fall i…",

Larian publishing director Michael Douse, who took to X to take a swipe at Steam's rivals. \"It's almost as if it isn't providing a shit service defined by public shareholder KPIs [Key Performance Indicators],\" wrote Douse. The man has a point. Valve stands apart from its competition in being a private company. That is to say, it's not traded on a stock exchange and it doesn't have shareholders whispering in its ear demanding it chase whatever short-term trend is currently driving up share prices. Unlike Epic, Amazon, Ubisoft, or EA (though, uh, I suppose that last one's set to change ), Valve only really has to answer to its president, Gabe Newell, and he's busy buying yacht companies .

The Aliexpress-bought Wi-Fi lightbulb had the glass structure sawn off with a serrated knife, exposing the tiny BL602 RISC-V chip inside, before the board was soldered to a surrogate microcontroller with an appropriate USB port and a few extra wires. This looks to have enabled the now Frankenstein-ed bulb board to run Vimpo's own Minecraft server implementation, called Ucraft. Controlling the bulb-based server with the help of a few other devices, including a small external display and a full-sized keyboard that frankly dwarfs every other piece of hardware involved, results in a very-playable looking implementation. If you'd like a poke around in Ucraft's files, Vimpo has uploaded their work to GitHub .

    "body": "I spent a good chunk of my weekend introducing a couple of friends to the wonders of going topside in search of trinkets, robots, and even perhaps friendship in Arc Raiders , and it looks like 462,485 other people had the same idea. Arc Raiders has been on a monumental run since it launched a couple of weeks back.

Helldivers 2, in contrast, has an all-time peak of just 458,709 , and that's including my squad. This milestone puts into context just how popular Arc Raiders is, and how quickly it's managed to rise up to sit comfortably with some of the biggest releases in the last few years, let alone 2025, which was a pretty strong year for shooters.

This is a world where one of my team is an alien and another is a demon. Maybe ghosts are real too? I'd hate to write off someone who turns out to have Sadako in their cellar.

Which superhero do you go on a date with? Who do you drop from the team? But where Telltale games also retained rudimentary walk-around-and-look-at-stuff scenes from their point-and-click ancestors like vestigial limbs, Dispatch ditches them in favor of being more like an interactive cartoon—with high-quality animation and acting—until suddenly it drops you into a shift working as a dispatcher.

It boasts a low barrier to entry due to non-prohibitive system requirements , and those requirements are so low fans have been putting it through the wringer to see just how old a GPU can run it . More recently, YouTuber Fully Buffered (via Tom's Hardware ) got the game to run on an AMD FX-9590 CPU , first released in 2013, revealing that the game's stated minimum required specs are a bit misleading. Fully Buffered broke down his process in the above video, where he shows the game running on the 12-year-old chip to a quality standard he calls \"not terrible.\" It peaks at around mid-40 FPS at lower resolutions, though input lag kneecaps the feasibility of playing this way for very long. The poor GPU, an RX 5700, is shown hovering around 30% utilization in Task Manager, its potency shown a hard ceiling by the comparatively ancient processor. Regardless, it's remarkable that it runs at all—and not just because of the severe bottleneck. As the video highlights, Battlefield 6 requires Trusted Platform Module 2.0—a fe…",

Titan Quest 2 is a hack-and-slash a la Diablo or Path of Exile inspired by Greek myth. It's only going up by 5 dollars, but it's on sale until then for $26.99. When PC Gamer online editor Fraser Brown gave the game a spin , he said \"stepping into the sandals of my Greek hero felt like travelling back in time to a simpler era, when you could enjoy an ARPG without intense number crunching, theorycrafting or engaging in live service systems.\" In fact, he said in his impressions the game was occasionally so placid that it didn't quite live up to the grand stakes of Greek legend—though the game has been upping the ante with new regions and bosses since its early access launch.

Character Select Welcome to Character Select, a weekly column where PC Gamer takes a look at the art and cosplay created by you. Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. When I started playing Minecraft, the way most people would dress as the characters involved a large cardboard box atop their shoulders, and then wearing a colour-coordinated outfit to match the character. It was simple but incredibly effective. After all, all you really need to identify a Minecraft character are its main features, and for the most part these were on its head and face.

It’s because that core game was so good I’m actually excited to play another compilation of Bandai Namco’s 80s classics—Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, anything you’d expect to see wallowing in the corner of a local greasy spoon. In a DLC announced earlier this year without a release window, those games and a few others will finally be woven into the collection this Thursday, Nov. 13. If you’re like me, you have more Namco compilations and miscellaneous ports of Pac-Man than you know what to do with, but this is more than just another re-release. On top of the archived art, photos, and developer interviews, this DLC is set to include three Atari ports of Pac-Man: 2600, 5200, and the version released on Atari 8-bit computers.

In a Steam post diplomatically and not at all confrontationally titled PIVOT OR DIE\", Facepunch revealed it has implemented a game-wide blueprint wipe. While Rust already enacts general map wipes that remove player structures and so forth, the blueprint wipe also removes everything they've unlocked from the crafting tree. \"When you join a freshly map-wiped server but already have everything unlocked, you're effectively skipping the entire early and mid-game,\" Facepunch explains in a Steam post. \"You can craft late-tier items immediately, bypassing all the gear and choices before it, which completely breaks the sense of progression.\" Following this logic, Facepunch has wiped all servers and blueprints, ef…",

This week, Jody appreciates Promise Mascot Agency's trucky charms. It's your job as an exiled yakuza with the same voice actor and off-the-charts unflappability as Kazuma Kiryu from the Like a Dragon games to manage those mascots, assigning them jobs, negotiating their bonuses, and bailing them out when things go wrong. It's like Kiryu got sick of that real estate management minigame and decided to try something less mundane. That's just one slice of the strange cake that is Promise Mascot Agency.

This 2D point-and-click from 2015 brought a Tim Burton flair to the genre, tasking you with saving your family—including Grandpa-raffin and Mothdog—from the dark monsters that have overtaken your home. Bringing light to the darkness is made a bit easier by the fact you are Bulb Boy, a boy who can unscrew your lightbulb head to help you solve puzzles. Also, you're immune to being electrocuted, just in case that should ever come in handy. It's a puzzle-adventure in the Machinarium style, full of secrets and silliness. Bulb Boy is currently available for free on Steam to bring attention to its recently released sequel, Bulb Boy 2: Jar of Despair . This time, Bulb Boy's mission is to find a jam jar in the cellar of the Bulb House, a simple task made nightmarish by the creature who wants to take your head for its own. It's got a demo if you want to try before you buy. The Bulb Boy adventures are twisted affairs that look like they're entirely made up of the…",

But we've also had an update on the latest chapter in the life of Demetrian Titus, protagonist of the bolterporn action games in the Space Marine series. After debuting as a captain of the Ultramarines in the first Space Marine, he was busted down to lieutenant for the sequel, and as we see in the trailer has now regained his former title. As of this promotion he's captain of the Second Company in place of Acheran, the guy in Space Marine 2 who constantly tells you he can only spare three men. Maybe that's why Acheran was demoted, although it's more likely he's dead or in a dreadnought. I'm sure we'll find out later. With that new rank comes a new responsibility. Roboute Guilliman, Primarch of the Ultramarines , has tasked Titus with taking back the 500 Worlds—the Ultramarines' domain, which has been lost to various enemies like the tyranids and Word Bearers over the last 10,000 years.

You and your people have hidden in the maintenance tunnels, but now the monstrosity is colonizing them too, so you've got to go into the biomes and build yourselves sustainable communities from the wreckage there—a landscape now populated by weird mutants that the Scale left in its wake.

It's easy to dismiss videogame recipe books as a frivolous marketing gimmick, and I'm as guilty of this as anyone else. My original plan for this article was to find the most preposterous example of a gaming-themed cookbook, then attempt to recreate the silliest recipe from it. I assumed this would be easy. I mean, nobody could actually write a good Sonic-themed cookbook, could they? Yet when I looked into this odd corner of gaming culture, I noticed two things. First, many of the gaming-themed recipe books you'll find on Amazon are not only well designed, but they're also filled with dishes that look like something you would actually want to eat.

As much as I love the nail-biting tension of extraction shooters, it's long been a genre obsessed with a rigorous gear grind and slow pace that make it almost impenetrable for new players, or those that can't dedicate more than a few hours a day or even a week. The one exception to this until now has been Hunt: Showdown , and while I can't recommend it enough, let's face it, it's not your typical extraction shooter. So, for all these years, the extraction shooter has remained the dominion of a select few with enough time and patience to dedicate to it—and invariably trounce anyone who dares to give it a casual go. Of course, with enough time and determination, you'll eventually join that elite band, but my point is that the genre isn't known for being welcoming and even semi-casual. If you want a genre to truly grow and experiment, encouraging a more diverse audience will do it. Just as I thought perhaps the genre would never become truly …",

The sequel's latest DLC, Dynasties of the East , introduces The Crucible. This radically reworks the RTS' loop in a fast-paced game of accruing power to fend off increasingly powerful forces. Described by developer Forgotten Empires as \"a challenge of endurance, strategy and luck\", The Crucible sees players guarding a Wonder as their chosen faction against escalating waves of foes.

But developer Tomas Sala wasn't satisfied with the end product, and has spent the last year or so overhauling the game in his spare time from supporting his other game— Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles . The result released this week, a free update that, according to Sala, reworks \"literally everything\" about the game. Certainly, the changes are extensive. The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster provides a complete visual overhaul of the game, not only improving the lighting, visual effects, animations etc, but also reworking the world itself. Many of its cities and key locations have been remade, while others have been expanded to look grander and more impressive. The comparison shot below gives you some idea of the differences (Image credit: Tomas Sala) The remaster also alters many of the Falconeer's key mechanics.

The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeli n e, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story—because after all … that's YOUR story, isn't it?\" A Variety report on N7 Day 2024 confirmed that the Mass Effect series had officially entered development: I'm not intimately familiar with the ins and outs of television production but a full year from that to \"we're figuring out how it fits with the games\" seems like kind of a languid pace to me.

You can get into ANY locked door in @ARCRaidersGame with a deployable barricade #plsfix pic.twitter.com/uR6qrYsrpF November 5, 2025 Naturally, this was not an intentional use case, so the bug was fixed Thursday in a small patch . But players are pointing out that without their incidental role as a skeleton key, barricades aren't the most desirable item. As one reply on an X thread discussing the bug from pizzaboneman put it: \"Darn it! I thought the barricades were useless so I sold them all. Turns out they were the master key!\" I'm sure it's a tough balancing act for Embark: on one hand, a wall wherever you need one might be the only thing between you and a hail of enemy bullets.

But it's true. By reported concurrent player counts, Grow a Garden is bigger than PUBG ever was on Steam, by far. It's even bigger than Fortnite. So, as Hollywood rushes to convert pretty much every game from Call of Duty to The Sims into beaucoup boxoffice bucks, I have some sad but not-unexpected news to deliver to the parents of all those Roblox-obsessed kiddies. Sorry, folks: you're gonna be dragged to the theaters in about a year to sit through Grow a Garden, the movie. On the plus side, it'll get your kids to stop playing Grow a Garden the game for about 90 minutes. Silver lining?

Blizzard has yet to step in on a newly discovered method of spawning endless numbers of enemies in the latest phase of Legion Remix. Unlike the Gulp Frogs incident in Mists of Pandaria Remix, this farm seems relatively less broken, but it still can net you millions of infinite power, which is used to level up your weapon and increase your character's overall strength. It's been two days since players began capitalizing on it and Blizzard hasn't made any move to kill it. The exploit does, however, cause serious lag from the volume of enemies pouring in if you happen to be nearby, which might be enough for it to land on Blizzard's nerf radar. For now, players are grouping up to slay as many demons as they can before the valve gets shut off. The Sentinax farm, as it's being referred to, is pretty straightforward. In the Broken Shore area there's an event full of demons that drop items you can use to spawn more demons. The trick is to join a group so you can keep a constant supply of them flowing in.

But Inzoi didn't deliver the adrenaline shot I'd predicted and (still upcoming) Paralives has always been expected to be the smaller contender.

Even though we'd already gotten the bad news that there isn't going to be a Sims 5 , things were looking swell for the rest of the series during its 25th anniversary in January.
