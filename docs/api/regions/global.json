Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel both added additional Vault Hunters as DLC, but Borderlands 3 didn't add any, so announcing a DLC character this early suggests Gearbox is confident in Borderlands 4 having some longevity. Or at least, more than the third one did. The new character is a robot who used to work as a dealer at a casino. Disillusioned by the horror of working in a customer-facing service position, C4SH becomes a Vault Hunter with powers based on random chance.

C4SH also has an ability that involves throwing playing cards, maybe like Gambit from the X-Men? On the Tokyo Game Show stage Pitchford explained that his own close-up magic skills were used as reference for this, with videos of him palming and throwing cards used by the animators. I could maybe have done with more info about how C4SH plays and less demonstration of Pitchford's magic skills, but I guess it wouldn't …",

    "body": "As reported by Automaton , a survey conducted by the Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA) during June and July found that 51% of Japanese game companies are using AI in some capacity. The survey responses came from CESA member companies , which include the likes of Capcom, Level-5, Square Enix, Sega, and many more spanning major developers and indies alike. The respondents reported using AI for generating visual game assets, story and text generation, and programming assistance. Additionally, 32% of CESA member companies also reported that they are using AI to help develop in-house game engines. There's been a lot of high-level discussion and grand statements about generative AI's potential use in gaming, but it's surprising just how much of a foothold it already has, at least in Japan. Some CESA members have been open about using AI, as Automaton points out, including Level-5 and Capcom . For instance, Level-5 is using it pretty extensively in everything from visual upscaling to character creation to code generation. The potential uses for generative AI in gaming vary drastically, though, just like opinions on it. Using AI to speed up repetitive coding or animatio…",

The fighting game-inspired platformer arrives on November 11, just a brisk year and a half after its June 2024 announcement . I got a first look at Possessor(s) in action earlier this year, but was not able to try it hands on. I liked what I saw though: Earnest storytelling inspired by early aughts anime dubs, slick combat with the promise of juggling, parries, and tricky bosses, plus some gorgeous character and environment art. That last bit is something I'm particularly excited about with Possessor(s): I find a lot of Metroid-style platformers can have overly abstracted, gamey environments. Hollow Knight and Silksong do a great job of avoiding this, with each area having a real tangible feeling and deep environmental storytelling. I also have to hand it to Metroid Dread on this front, a game that otherwise left me cold. Possessor(s) really sells the illusion of a ruined city over its platforming gauntlets, and I'm eager to see more. As for combat, you can only glean so much without trying something hands on, but Possessor(s) looks propulsive and fun, …",

Some of this content was made available to players who only purchased the regular standard version of Silent Hill f. While it's unclear how much of the exclusive content leaked to standard edition players, several people on the Silent Hill subreddit reported getting access to exclusive outfits, but not the soundtrack or other bonuses. Before you get too excited about free in-game items, it doesn't look like Konami will let the mix-up slide. A post on the official Silent Hill X (formerly Twitter) account addressed the situation on Friday, stating, \"We’re investigating an issue on the Steam version of Silent Hill f where bonus and pre-order content not included in the purchased edition is temporarily accessible. A patch is scheduled to be released soon. Thank you for your co…",

There will also be a new copper golem mob that autonomously organizes items you leave in copper chests into nearby regular chests. Like other copper items, the golems can oxidize and change color over time. While I wish I could have made all of those copper items when the ore was first added to the game in 2021, better late than never. Copper tools and gear have been in Java mods for a while now, so it's nice to see them officially added to the vanilla version. Copper is much easier to find early on in a new Minecraft world than iron, so this update will make it easier to gear up right after spawning into a new game. While it's pretty time consuming mining and smelting copper for building, its abundance at surface level in the overworld makes it perfect for crafting starting gear. The…",

Developed by Black Widow Games and released as a PC Gamer exclusive on demo discs in 2000, They Hunger took the tech and design tenets of Half-Life and transposed them to an all-new zombie horror adventure. Delivering a near-professional grade experience, it's one of the best singleplayer Half-Life mods ever made , a thrilling and often deeply weird survival horror game created at a time when zombies were still relatively novel. They Hunger was the last singleplayer experience Black Widow Games created. This wasn't meant to be the case. Between 2005 and 2008, the studio worked on a sequel to its Half-Life mod titled They Hunger: Lost Souls . A new zombie adventure built in Half-Life 2's revolutionary Sourc…",

Though its present success may be a little in doubt, that legacy remains an astonishing addition to videogame canon. Which is why I expect you to remember it all, down to every last title. Today's quiz is simple—you just have to name every game BioWare has ever made. To be clear, that's only games it developed itself, and only ones that actually released—no cancelled projects. But to warn you, it does include some games that didn't come out on PC. I'm afraid you do have to remember the one time they made an RPG for a Nintendo handheld. And just to make it a bit trickier, you've got to do it in two minutes. Ready? Scroll down to the quiz below to start. Let us know how you did in the comments!",

While it's unlikely we'll ever see Dice Poker get an official spinoff in the way Gwent did , it does finally have its own dedicated roguelike. Dead Finger Dice is an Inscryption -ish mix of digital tabletop gaming and spooky narrative puzzling, with a gnarly twist where you use your character's fingers as betting currency. The premise is that you've been kidnapped and imprisoned aboard The Avarice, a luxury yacht inhabited by bloodthirsty demonic billionaires. These sadistic superrich monsters, who include Nosferatu-ish vampires and snake-headed Medusas among their ranks, force you to play games of Dice Poker, where you get five dice and four rolls to achieve the highest-scoring poker-hand you can.

For the uninitiated, Fights in Tight Spaces takes the tactical layer of games like X-COM and replaces the aliens with a heavy dose of John Wick. Playing as suave silhouette Agent 11, each level places you in an isometric, turn-based action scenario filled with monochromatic goons, then deals you a handful of martial-arts themed playing cards. You need to play the cards to take out your opponents in the most efficient way possible. It's a straightforward premise, but one sleekly presented and with more depth than you might expect. The DLC, named K9 Division , adds a helpful hound into the game's card-based brawls. According to developer Ground Shatter, this involves more than just an extra character to play with.

There was certainly potential in running around playing janitor within the brutalist interdimensional nexus known as The Oldest House. But Remedy's cooperative shooter simply didn't feel ready for action, as I discovered in my FBC: Firebreak review . It was too lean, too repetitive, too unbalanced, and lacked some fundamental features like a proper tutorial. Remedy has spent the last few months plugging holes in Firebreak's leaky hull, but the latest patch, which arrives next week, represents the studio's first proper attempt to turn the ship around. The dramatically named Breakpoint update seems, on paper, to represent a complete overhaul of Firebreak's core experience, while also adding a whole new mission and a bunch of smaller features, too. At the heart of Breakpoint is a total rework of how missions are selected. The Jobs board—from which players picked a mission to play and then customised its difficulty and length—has been hacked to splinters with a fire axe and tossed into a skip. It's replaced by a 'Crises' board that offers a tailored selection of Jobs with preset lengths that refresh every 30 m…",

Ananta is borrowing—or brazenly copying—a lot , but it might have some wild-ass ideas of its own, too. The main impression I got from playing about half-an-hour of Ananta at this year's Tokyo Game Show was: Wow it must have taken a lot of people to make this game! China is on the path to dominate the next decade of triple-A games , and there's no flashier way to do it than to make (or at least appear to be making) the ur-game. Every mechanic from the top 10 or 20 or 50 most popular games in the world, combined, is surely better than any of those games individually, right?

This would be the largest such leveraged buyout ever recorded. According to the WSJ's anonymous sources, EA could be sold for as much as $50 billion, though the final price has not yet been agreed on, and EA has an estimated market value of $43 billion. The group of investors reportedly includes the private equity firm Silver Lake and the government of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The deal could be announced as early as next week, and would be the largest leveraged buyout ever recorded. A leveraged buyout is when a private equity firm uses a significant amount of borrowed money to seal the deal, with the asset set to be acquired used as collateral in the debt. This effectively leaves the acquired company liable for the debt⁠—if its income can't adequately service the debt, it will bear the consequences of a default, not the investors who made the purchase, and that usually means closures and layoffs. As reported by the Los Angeles Times , one such leveraged buyout eventually resulted in bankrupt…",

Plenty of players have already been to The Slab , a prison area you get taken to after being captured by a specific enemy early in the game. It's a scary place that strips you of your gear and forces you to fight your way out with your bare hands and basic movement abilities. Parts of Silksong can be cruel, but Team Cherry at least designed it so you can't be imprisoned unless you've progressed far enough into the game to have the tools you need to escape. Or so we thought. Kilroy found a way to get there without those tools, sentencing poor Hornet to life in bug prison. \"I don't know why anyone would want to do this, but I have done it anyway,\" the YouTube description reads. \"Rest in peace Hornet.\" Sending Ho…",

Once the red outlines on the edges of the screen turn yellow, you can grab weapons and items—and even the level geometry. While tumble grabbing, your beam will be able to grapple onto any surface. That means you can, with some finesse, climb up walls and across the ceiling by flinging your tumbling body. Your tumble grabbing ability is tied to your stamina, however, so there's at least going to be one limiting factor preventing complete wall-climbing chaos. \"Tumble Grab also means that you can grab stuff in situations you previously couldn’t,\" Semiwork said. \"For example, if you’re levitated by the vicious Mentalist, you can grab a weapon and fight back!\" Semiwork demonstrated the power of the tumble grab in an accompanying video .

Path of Exile 2's 0.3 update, The Third Edict, came out at the end of August to warm reception . Introducing Act 4 released us from the hell of running Acts 1-3 twice whenever we want to level a character, the Abyss mechanic is fun and rewarding, and in general the community has been happy with the direction of the game. One thorny issue that continues to plague PoE2, however, is the endgame. Currently, in order to juice our maps and for the best rewards, we have to navigate the Atlas of Worlds until we find a spot with multiple overlapping towers.

Others got indoctrinated by Booktok (the book side of TikTok) and still others were gripped by the rise of the romantasy subgenre.

But it does get better, especially once you realise that you can just ignore most of the monsters you come across. I'm something of a magpie and a hoarder in survival horror games, which means that I collect every single item I come across and then never want to use them. So my solution to this has always been to rely on being as sneaky as possible and perfecting the art of the dodge. And just like most survival games, it works a charm: I found every single note, letter, item, and omamori in Silent Hill f, and I hardly killed a thing. (Image credit: Konami) One of the benefits of Silent Hill f being a third-person horror game is that you can play corners; I used this to check corners and alleyways before I walked around or past them.

Every ending adds so much more to the story; they aren't simply fun easter eggs for players with a bit of extra time on their hands to find. But you don't just have to wait until the end to get new story information. You'll find new items and notes in every subsequent playthrough and even find new cutscenes as you progress through the narrative.

In a blog post published yesterday, Blizzard revealed a series of new cosmetics that bring a Starcraft-themed armor set for each Diablo 4 class.

It basically provides a direct data path between storage, such as an NVMe, and a GPU's VRAM, neatly bypassing the CPU and system memory. It's been around since 2019, a little earlier than RTX IO . That was a much-hyped feature of GeForce RTX 30-series GPUs, and Nvidia expressly said that it allows \"streaming directly from SSD to GPU memory.\" However, if you read the current webpage for RTX IO , that's not mentioned at all, and instead just focuses on its other performance-enh…",

It's also in the world loot pool, so you can technically get it just about anywhere with some luck. The first time I got the Convergence was actually from clearing a random drill site. Here's where you need to go if you're not feeling lucky, though. How to get the Convergence in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can farm for the Convergence as a dedicated drop from the Bramblesong boss in the Bittervein mine, in the north of the Stoneblood Forest, Terminus Range. This is the northernmost point of the region, behind the Substation Canonary, which is best accessed by heading northwest from the nearby Deathright silo. As with all abandoned Auger mines, such …",

    "body": "There's still not a whole lot we know about the upcoming Virtua Fighter, headed up by Yakuza studio Ryu Ga Gotoku… and even after a 50-minute showing at Tokyo Game Show this week, that remains true. But hey, we did get a look at a brand-new battle system that'll be in the game, which plans to stand alongside Virtua Fighter's traditional style as its own thing. Called Uprising, it seems like RGG Studio's attempt at delving into a more modern fighting game formula with \"dynamic momentum-shifting opportunities,\" according to the presentation. These opportunities come in the form of new mechanics Flowguard, Break and Rush, and the Stunner and Stun Combo systems. The first is a \"new defensive system designed with stylish movements,\" which RGG Studio says \"expands options and introduces fresh dynamics for offense and defense beyond traditional guarding.\" Flowguard's defensive options are closely tied to Break and Rush, which seems to be the main selling point behind Uprising. It's essentially a part break system—repeatedly damaging the same body parts—like the head, body, and legs—will eventually open up huge vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to gain access to \"powerful offensive o…",

    "body": "Last month, Microsoft introduced Advanced Shader Delivery, a mechanism that claims to solve one of the biggest annoyances PC gamers face these days: shader compilation. Although the technology will initially be limited to the Asus ROG Xbox Ally handhelds and games purchased through the Xbox app, an update to Agility SDK means that other vendors and merchants can now get started on supporting it too. Microsoft's Agility software development kit (SDK) is a collection of tools that game developers can use to implement the latest DirectX features, without having to wait for them to be integrated into Windows itself. In the latest 1.618 version, Agility now supports Advanced Shader Delivery, which was announced last month . The rather unassuming name is for a complex database system that will hopefully be the ultimate solution to all problems relating to shader compilation. Modern 3D graphics involve tens of thousands of different shaders, and APIs such as DirectX, Vulkan, or Metal generate them in a common format. For your graphics card to be able to process them, they need to be compiled specifically for that hardware. For gaming PCs, that process is carried out by the GPU drivers, a…",

At press time, Tokyo was reportedly at least twice as big as Milton Keynes and the island of Hokkaido was said to 'make the Isle of Wight look like a hatchback'. Which is why Forza Horizon 6 is headed to the land of the rising sun. In a chat with GamesRadar , the arcade racing sim's art director Don Arceta said that the series' Japanese venture would be \"our biggest map yet.\" But fear not, because it's \"also our most full.\" Just what you'd expect a dev on an upcoming release to say, I suppose, but I've got no reason to doubt Arceta. Playground hasn't run into much trouble creating bigger and more things-crammed worlds over the past couple of Horizon games, and it sounds like the studio didn't run into any trouble finding stuff to do in Japan, either. \"Obviously, we can't go bigger without filling it with things to do and see,\" said Arceta. \"And I think this map that we've created for Japan, or Horizon's version of Japan, is big, but also dense. There's always something around the corner for you to discover and see. But yeah, it's bigger…",
