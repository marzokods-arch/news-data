The launch of the OnePlus 13 is still fresh in my mind. But OnePlus, backed by the earlier-than-usual release of the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 , is already launching a successor: the OnePlus 15. Following its unveiling in China last month, the OnePlus 15 is now available globally, featuring a slightly revised design, new colors, and impressive battery and charging speeds. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 15 eschews the flagship killer identity that the brand previously established and is instead surrounded by the aura of a true flagship. As it finds a spot among other flagships, it’s worth evaluating how the OnePlus 15 competes against its competitors in the premium segment.",

This time, though, instead of creating a jack of all trades (which, to be fair, was a master of most of them), OnePlus is after power users — or at least, I think it is. The reason I say I think rather than I know is that despite testing this phone for a few weeks, I’m not quite sure how we got to this point. I know the OnePlus 15 is powerful on paper — it boasts the latest chipset, a large battery, ample RAM, and sufficient storage to prove it. But for everything that has improved, it feels like just as much has taken a step backward from a predecessor that is still one of the best Android phones you can buy .

The company also claims that this battery will maintain 80% of its effective capacity after four years, but what does this actually mean?

Google’s latest November Pixel Feature Drop introduced a number of exciting upgrades for Pixel phones, but many users are finding that most of the new features aren’t actually live yet.

But even that’s not the way to get an early look at the very, very latest Android changes — and for that, we’re turning to the newest Android Canary .

It’s a big deal for IT teams trying to move away from Windows, though history shows that enterprise migrations don’t happen overnight. If Google ever extends this tech to regular Chromebook users, it could finally make Chrome OS a real rival to cheap Windows laptops. Last year, Google quietly acquired Cameyo , a software virtualization company known for making Windows apps run seamlessly through a browser. Now, that acquisition is paying off. Google has officially rolled out Cameyo by Google, a rebranded and fully integrated version built right into the Chrome OS ecosystem . The concept sounds simple but carries huge implications: Cameyo lets businesses run their existing Windows apps directly on Chrome browsers or Chromebooks, with no full Windows installation required.

Launching at $500, you can already save $150 with a coupon. Everybody wants to be running the latest Android, packed with all of Google’s latest features and fixes. With phones, while we may not always know exactly when the next big update will land, at least major manufacturers tend to make commitments to deliver a known quantity of them — we can look forward to updates for so many years. But on Android-powered projectors , that upgrade path is far less certain, and if you want to make sure you’re getting a specific Android release, your best bet is to just start with it from the beginning. And that’s exactly what Aurzen is offering with the EAZZE D1 MAX. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

According to leaker Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 series is slated to feature a minimum of 12GB of memory across its different models. While that specification is identical to the Galaxy S25’s RAM capacity, the upcoming flagship phones could feature faster memory.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s upcoming “tri-fold” foldable could have a 5,600mAh battery and a 6.5-inch cover screen, according to a Korean outlet. The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

Frequent changes to product plans for the Galaxy S26 Edge and Galaxy S26 Plus have delayed Samsung’s design and production timeline. It would be a slight understatement to say that Samsung’s plans for its upcoming flagships are all over the place. We first heard that the Galaxy S26 launch is reportedly set for February 2026 in San Francisco. A subsequent leak disagreed with this timeline, stating that the company had managed to pull itself together and is now gunning for a late January launch .

It’s believed Samsung could reduce the phone’s thickness and weight by over 10%. This comes after the Galaxy Z Fold 7 received a radical redesign. Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7 earlier this year, and it has an ultra-thin and light form factor following years of iterative designs. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also delivered a thin form factor, but Samsung might go the extra mile with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. The Bell (h/t: Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that Samsung wants to make the Galaxy Z Flip 8 much thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. More specifically, the company is apparently aiming to reduce the Z Flip 8’s thickness and weight by more than 10%. This suggests that the upcoming Flip phone could be ~12mm thick when folded and weigh ~169 grams. However, the outlet added that it cannot rule out a further reduction in weight and thickness.",

Disney, although hesitant, might have to oblige to reduce its losses and restore investors’ confidence ahead of its earnings call tomorrow. Over the past couple of weeks, Google and Disney have been at loggerheads due to a pricing dispute. What started with both parties’ failure to meet each other halfway in negotiations, resulting in more than 20 Disney channels, including ABC and ESPN, being removed from YouTube TV , has spread to other streaming platforms and blocked access to Disney’s paid content across other Google-owned platforms . The conflict is costing both parties. YouTube has been forced to issue refunds to customers for the unavailability of Disney-owned channels on YouTube TV and prevent them from cancelling subscriptions. With its subscriber count estimated to be over 9 million in the US, that’s a cumulative loss of nearly $200 million for the tech giant. The los…",

Once you start navigating, you can view a power-saving version of the navigation map right on your lock screen by pressing your phone’s power button. To exit this mode, simply tap the screen or press the power button again. If you want to return to the power-saving navigation view, just press the power button once more.",

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR A code string in the Galaxy Ring Manager app mentions a “Ring gesture for glasses,” hinting at possible smart glasses integration.

The Galaxy Ring already supports a double-pinch gesture for phone control, and an earlier patent suggests that broader cross-device controls could be on the way. Samsung’s Galaxy Ring hasn’t had the best press lately , but it isn’t going anywhere, and its functionality may soon expand beyond interacting with just your phone. A clue we spotted in a recent app update hints that the wearable could one day help control Samsung’s upcoming Android XR glasses.

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",
