Players didn't like how currency gain slowed to a crawl (that has since been fixed ) and server woes were widely reported. But one of the enduring complaints about Siege X is that the shift to free-to-play has triggered a huge uptick in cheating. I caught up with Siege creative director Alexander Karpazis at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week. I asked if the team at Ubisoft Montreal expected cheating to surge to the extent that it did in June. \"We knew having free access that it could be a vector that is exploited,\" he said, \"and we were ramping up our R6 ShieldGuard. In a lot of ways it really did help, but we need to be faster when it comes to making sure that we stay one step ahead of cheat makers, too.\" Eliminating cheating entirely is impossible, I acknowledged, and Karpazis agreed. \"Absolutely. That's a message that we keep on having to share with our community.

He listed Tekken 1-5 as his \"most hated\" games and had public \"feuds\" with Tekken's Katsuhiro Harada and Devil May Cry's Hideki Kamiya. While working on 2005's Ninja Gaiden Black, he said that Devil May Cry 3 director Hideaki Itsuno—who went on to make DMC 4, 5, and Dragon's Dogma—\"did pretty well for a young guy\" and \"might make something even better next time.\" Behind the blustery facade, Itagaki seemingly respected his action game peers a great deal; roasting them was his way of projecting the image of a true Master Ninja. But as I tried to convey in my Ninja Gaiden 4 review , Itagaki's games were different from the ones his competitors were making. It wasn't just that they tended to be more challenging, but that they took themselves so seriously; the winking tone that Kamiya favored with DMC's Dante and later Bayonetta were nowhere to be found in Itagaki's games. His sense of humor was adding an easier \"Ninja Dog\" mode to Ninja Gaiden for players who died too many times on the first level. The most cosmically strange thing about Ninja Gaiden 4…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Steam reviews are an endless source of both information and amusement. Where else can you read a review from someone who has played a survival game for 35,000 hours before giving it a thumbs-down ? Or, for that matter, find a glowing review of an MMO someone has played for less than an hour? But the best Steam reviews, for my money, are the ones where a player hammers out a review that encapsulates an entire game in just a few words, like the one in the image above by Steam user \"Cyber Lesbian\" for Marvel Rivals. Short reviews are like mini-poems, really, and even when they're silly they can still tell you a lot about game. I put a quiz together a few weeks ago to challenge you to identify 10 games based only on a blurb from a Steam review . It went over well, so we're doing it again! In the quiz below, see if you can guess the game based on a short Steam review . And let us know how you scored in the comments: overwhelmingly positive, or mostly negative?",

Cards Against Humanity purchased the plot of land, located near the border between the US and Mexico, in 2017 to protest (and, one would assume, hinder) the erection of a wall between the two countries. In 2023, a local homeowner noticed that SpaceX was using the site for building materials and heavy equipment and brought it to CAH's attention, after which SpaceX gave CAH a \"12-hour ultimatum to accept a lowball offer\" for the land. Instead, CAH sued. The settlement came shortly before the case went to trial, which was scheduled to happen on November 3. CAH told AP that SpaceX copped to trespassing during the discovery phase, but it opted to settle because a trial \"would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX.\" Beyond that, CAH said \"the upside is that SpaceX has removed their construction equipment from our land and we’re able to work with a local landscaping company to restore the …",

But despite how Escape From Duckov presents itself, it actually doesn't waste much time on duck material. Yes, almost every NPC is some type of waterfowl, and yes, enemies quack when they notice you. But aside from an occasional duck egg consumable, there's not much duck humor going on at all. In fact, you don't even really have to play as one: The duck customization options give you all the tools to craft a different bird entirely. Or a sort of Fall Guys-esque bean man. Or Heihachi from Tekken. (Image credit: Bilibili) Maybe the developers at Team Soda, an internal game studio of Chinese media platform Bilibili, just love ducks—or maybe Duckov's theme was just a bit of canny buzz marketing.

No siree, this is the \" Personal Calendar ,\" which tracks new and upcoming games that Steam thinks might be of interest to you. How does Steam figure out what sort of new games you're interested in? The magic of algorithms, of course, based on what you're playing and what other people with \"similar playtime profiles\" are adding to their wishlists. The system is \"re-trained\" with new data every day, although Valve says you're not likely to see major changes in recommendations aside from the addition of upcoming games that fall within the calendar's window, which extends out two months from the current date. \"We've been drawn to the idea of having a visual representation of upcoming releases in calendar form to help understand how far away an exciting new launch is,\" Valve explained. \"So this new calendar view takes the list of soon-to-release titles, filters them down to the set that we recommend most for you, and maps them out across time for you to see at-a-glance. You'll find that some days have a bunch of exciting releases for you while others may only have one or none.\" You can filter your results w…",

They're gorgeous, distinct, spacious, and most importantly, they're packing loads of vehicles. They are exactly the injection of large-scale action that Battlefield 6 currently underdelivers—in fact, they balance out the map pool so well that it's disappointing they weren't included at launch.

In all seriousness, Hello Games long ago completed the redemption arc for No Man's Sky, (which now sits at \"Very Positive\" on Steam with around 170,000 reviews) and for years now has been on a well-deserved victory lap. We can have a laugh about Murray's inability to leave the 'we're just the little guys' schtick behind, but at the same time there's no doubting that love has been poured into this game over just shy of a decade. No Man's Sky received the major Voyager update just over a month ago , adding the ability to build and customise giant spaceships known as Corvettes that you can get your mates to act as crew on.

That's what managing a medieval city is all about. Farms are important for long-term survival, but fishing and gathering makes more sense if people need food quickly. Chopping logs into planks means construction on new buildings can commence, but if people are freezing in their homes, that timber should be turned into firewood instead. And assigning laborers to salvage nearby ruins for resources should be put on hold if—and here's just one quick example—a giant angry bear is rampaging through the town brutally mauling everybody to death.

But if, like me, the Evo is your first foray into Secretlab's world of desks, it's a worthy investment—if you can stomach its hefty price tag. When the Secretlab Magnus Evo first arrived, the biggest thing that stuck out to me was just how heavy the thing was. I opted for the 1.5 m desk length for my small apartment—though it also comes in the slightly larger 1.7 m length option—and with a metal frame containing motor work in the legs, my delivery tracking informed me that the box came in at a whopping 63 kg. Thankfully I had the foresight to call a friend for help with assembly, and I would definitely recommend two people to put the Magnus Evo together. The parts are heavy, and the desk has to be assembled upside down before lifted upright. The actual process of putting the desk together was simple—I'd consider myself to be a little illiterate…",

Nevertheless, it's a topic that's plagued Battlefield 6 since the very beginning, though its slate of strong military skins at launch was refreshing, to say the least. But with the launch in the rearview mirror now, all eyes are on Battlefield 6 Season 1 to see whether or not that grounded, military feeling is completely thrown to the wayside. After a handful of hours playing Season 1's content early, I can report that the first batch of post-launch cosmetics largely continues to deliver more grounded styles, but those of you who draw the distinction between tactical military gear and more stylised, 'cool' soldier apparel more strictly might see where this could potentially end up.

It's just been updated with a new M5 chip and a bizarre headband, but yep, that's the Vision Pro alright—still looking like an intriguing, but oddly-designed take on how the future of wearable tech should be. Well, Samsung has just launched its Galaxy XR headset , and if I'm not mistaken, I think I can hear the poor old Vision Pro howling from over here. Samsung looks to have used Apple's product as an example of what not to do, as many of the critiques of the Vision Pro seem fixed—on paper, at least. The pricing, for one. At $1,800, the Galaxy XR is still a bit of a teeth-clencher, but it's still nearly half the price of Apple's initial offering. It's also a good-looking device, with an outer screen that doesn't appear to display your bugged-out eyeballs to all and sundry. Sure, I don't think I'd be quite brave enough to wear one in public, but its got futuristic vibes that di…",

According to this blog post on the Microsoft Dev site by Raymond Cheng , pifmgr.dll was added in Windows 95 and is chock full of icons that were created mostly for fun. The idea was that they provided a library of icons \"for people to use for their own homemade shortcut files.\" If Cheng's list is complete, there are a grand total of 38 icons contained in the dll file. The dll also does duty, \"as the name might suggest, to manage PIF files, which are Program Information Files that describe how to set up a virtual MS-DOS session for running a specific application.\" And yet it still clocks in at just 38 kilobytes. Remarkable in an age when your typical minor software update is measured in gigabytes and a multiple-terabyte SSD get filled up in picoseconds. Well, ish. Whatever, the icons are 32 by 32 pixels and 16 colours, though Windows 95 did actually support 256-colour icons. And if you rifle through Windows 11's…",

For a long time, DDR4 RAM was cheap enough to be worth consideration if you were looking to build a budget gaming PC. But judging from some recent charts shared by semiconductor analyst Ray Wang , DDR4 pricing is now so expensive it's hardly worth it compared to DDR5, even with DDR5 pricing having increased. There's no source given for these charts, but it tracks with other analysis and even consumer tracking such as on pcpartpicker.com , and Wang is a reliable industry analyst. The AI boom (or bubble) has most certainly played a big part in this, because AI datacentres require tons of DRAM for stacks of high bandwidth memory (HBM). And while DDR5 memory offers the latest and greatest on this front, much of this will be spoken for by big customers, leading many to fall back to DDR4, creating more demand and causing this price rise. This will have combined with declining DDR4 production as DRAM manufacturers transition more heavily towards DDR5, resulting in tons of demand and less supply. Thus, higher prices. We're not just seeing this with RAM, but also with flash storage for SSDs. In fa…",

This is, by far, the most intense yet breathable map in Battlefield 6, but what struck me is how instantly iconic it felt. Battlefield 6's maps have been controversial since the very beginning, to say the least. Of its launch offerings, I think Siege of Cairo is fantastic (as is the returning Operation Firestorm), and I'm open to Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak, and even New Sobek City when people aren't abusing the rooftops. But other than Cairo, I wouldn't say any of these arenas are all that memorable or iconic. If you've instead been waiting for more of the large-scale warfare that the series is traditionally known for, then Season 1 will be a salve. Already, we're getting two large maps in Blackwell Fields and Eastwood. Both maps support ground and air vehicles, though only Blackwell Fields features jets. Bla…",

Currently, virtually all PC monitors with OLED screens are based on panels from just two suppliers—LG and Samsung. This duopoly is obviously never going to be a good thing for pricing and competition. So, the insertion of TCL into the fray is most welcome. According to flatpanelshd , TCL will invest over $4 billion into to the new facility, known as T8 and located in Guangzhou, China. The factory will use a so-called 8.6-generation production process, creating huge 2.29 by 2.62 metre OLED substrates, which can then be sliced into smaller screens. TCL currently produces OLED panels on the 5.5G process, mainly for smaller displays that go into laptops, tablets and phones.

Some context: In \"Remix\" events, WoW players can make an alt that's transported to a \"remixed\" version of a certain expansion. While there, they're given a functionally infinite power scaling mechanic courtesy of the Infinite Dragonflight. This kinda breaks the usual holy trinity of tanks, healers, and DPS, however—because if you're able to scale your DPS so high you can melt raid bosses solo, then why wouldn't you just pick the classes with the most in-built damage resistance and defensive cooldowns? As such, the Mythic+ listings for Legion Remix are flooded with shield icons. It's tanks all the way down. Well, Blizzard's trying to address that, per a post sent to the Blizzard forums yesterday. Healers and DPS specs in Legion Remix can now enjoy a 10% increase to their damage, a 33% reduction in damage taken, and a whopping 100% increase to their max HP. That means every single Legion Remix DPS and Healer just has twice as much healt…",

It's called Saints Quarter, and I wouldn't blame you for forgetting (or only now realizing) it exists. Until yesterday, I'd only played on it by accident. Saints Quarter is an anomaly in Battlefield 6's map pool, because it's the only map that's exclusively infantry-only. The most popular modes like Conquest, Rush, and Breakthrough are incompatible with Saints Quarter, so you'll only encounter it in 8v8 playlists like Team Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. (If you also forgot Battlefield 6 had those modes, you're forgiven twice.) I don't fire up Battlefield 6 looking for cramped city streets and small teams—it's all about the big maps, baby—but I have to give Saints Quarter credit. It's not my favorite Battlefield 6 map, but it might be its most successful. In essence, Saints Quarters represents Battlefield Studios' best stab at the Call of Duty experience.

There are seriously a lot of these: in the second half of 2025 alone we've had Heartbeat in Thailand, Such a Guy, Road to Empress, and Love Begins With Goodbye. Most are centred around romance and themed similarly to visual novels: you're a guy, there are a handful of women to talk to, and your choices determine which woman you'll end up hooking up with. Sometimes it's as simple as that: sometimes there's a bit of heart-pumping action involved. At Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week I saw a game called Island of Hearts, which releases early next year and is ostensibly a \"big deal\" as far as these FMV dating sims games go. It's published by 4Divinity for one—a Singapore-based publisher with a growing profile in Asia.

Today, that's begun to change thanks to This Is No Cave. It's a minimalist sci-fi platformer, where you play as a charming little yellow-suited astronaut attempting to escape their crash landing on an alien planet by using their boot thrusters and grappling hook to fling their tumbling body through a labyrinth of subterranean tunnels. (Those tunnels, I'm told, are not a cave.) The secret to making 2D movement manageable for me, it turns out, is to take the buttons out of my hands. In This Is No Cave, movement is controlled with mouseclicks: Left click jumps and fires suit thrusters to launch yourself towards my cursor, while right click latches onto grapple points with my grappling hook. That's it. The simplicity of controls, however, doesn't detract from the complexity of the platforming…",
