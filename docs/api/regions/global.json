It was originally set to launch in the second quarter of 2025, but developers said in June—very near the end of that release target—that they were postponing to later in the year , \"to ensure we give Olden Era the care it deserves.\" As it turns out, that wasn't quite enough time to get things done, as the team now says it wants to \"conduct more tests, improve the UI, and redesign some of the units,\" which is going to push it out into 2026. The good news amidst the bad is that a demo for HOMM: Olden Era is now available on Steam , offering players access to the game's tutorial and three different singleplayer modes, using four \"very different factions\" of the six planned for the early access release. There's no time limit on the demo, so you can play as much as you like. \"We'd love to hear your thoughts after tr…",

In fact, it was just a week later that Warner Bros Pictures co-chairman and CEO Mike De Luca confirmed that a deal was being done . Well, now it's official, and not only that, we've got a date too: A Minecraft Movie 2, or whatever it ends up being called, is set to hit screens on July 23, 2027. (Image credit: Warner Bros.) A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess is returning for the sequel, according to a Deadline report, which is nice because he said he wanted to , and will also co-write the script along with Chris Galletta, one of the screenwriters on the first film. A cast hasn't been announced, but Jason Momoa, who was outfitted in some interesting wardrobe choices in A Minecraft Movie, is listed as one of the executive producers on the sequel, so I would expect he'll return.

This week I've been: observing Battlefield 6's bots in the natural habitat, feeling a lot like David Attenborough. During my many hours putting Battlefield 6 through its paces in early access, I had the chance to face off against and team up with content creators and other journalists. That's cool and all, but some of the most fun I had was against Battlefield 6's bots. Not because they're incredibly easy to farm for kills (though that's also true), but because they're so…interesting. It's hard to truly grasp just how dumb BF6's AI-controlled bots really are, and that's a shame because you're unlikely to ever witness it for yourself outside of the campaign. These bots only ever joined in on the action whenever the server couldn't be fully populated by real players. During a limited review period, that's an inevitability. Once Battlefield 6 is in the wild, chances are we'll never see these bots in their natural habitat ever again (outside of Portal, I suppose). As you'd expect from bots in any multiplayer game, they're essentially free kills…",

Bridges and Ports was originally expected to launch in mid-2024, a few months after the release of the Beach Properties asset pack earlier that year. But Beach Properties was such a mess that Paradox eventually apologized for the whole thing and just gave it to everyone for free, and ultimately delayed the expansion into the second quarter of 2025 so it could focus on the main game, which was also a mess. Then it delayed Bridges and Ports again, to near the end of 2025 , because everything was a mess. But apparently now that's all been sorted, at least enough that the expansion can be unleashed on the public. The Bridges and Ports expansion will add 20 new drawbridges and lift bridges, customizable ports, a new Ferry Transport System, \"expanded maritime industries\"—fishing, offshore oil rigs, that sort of thing—and three new maps, more than 100 assets, and new achievements.

Think of getaways as an extra layer of customization that merges travel and generic lots, but instead of trusting your sims to roam free, you can give them a to-do list that they'll (usually) follow. Your sims can fill roles you design and specify, or the game can supplement gaps with random assignments. I like using it to send child sims off to camp for a weekend while knowing they'll come home better for it, or for keeping bigger households busy and on-task so I can focus elsewhere.

There's also 'hardware' XP boosters, which are slightly less obvious, but these will double your progression with weapons, vehicles, and the like. With how long it can take to level up gear, hardware boosters are just as important as your regular career XP boosts. Now, you'll get a handful of XP boosts from pre-ordering Battlefield 6, since this gives you the Tombstone Pack, which includes the Gravedigger skin, Hatchet weapon package, and a few other bits and bobs.

But regional pricing on Steam supports an awful lot of other currencies, allowing for local costs that are, ideally, better for consumers in other parts of the world than converting to US dollars. In reality, though, the system works out better for some gamers than others: Some regional prices end up being cheaper than a converted price, but others can be significantly more expensive. The price of Battlefield 6 in Chinese yuan, for instance, is ¥268 according to SteamDB , which works out to a little under $38, quite a discount on its $70 price in the US; at the other end of the scale, though, are gamers in Israel, who are going to have to fork over 299 new shekels, which converts to nearly $92.

Not to me, it's not. Judging from the video demonstration above, the real magic occurs in the last stage of the pipeline, where the neural model cleans up the speech even better than the Wiener filter does (no sniggering, that's a serious scientific term ). Apparently this method of snooping can be performed on \"consumer-grade mice with high-fidelity sensors\", which sounds a lot like \"gaming mouse\" to me. That does seem to be exactly the case, as in the full paper (pdf warning) we can see the researchers used a Razer Viper at 8 kHz polling to train the models used for this attack. I suppose one of the key requirements is a high polling rate, as a higher polling rate means more data, which means more accurate data clean-up to isolate acoustics, ie, speech: \"Attackers can exploit these sensors’ ever-increasing pol…",

For this, you'll need Meowlux Wish Coins, which you'll purchase with Rose Orbs (the game's main premium currency) and what I expect will be the most desirable code currency. While you'll unlock the ability to redeem codes almost immediately, you'll have to progress a teensy bit further until you do the Thunder Demon Smackdown (essentially combat training) in the Seabreeze Festival to unlock the gacha.

It was an appropriate location to do so, as the US state is also home to multiple Intel foundries, and Fab 52 is one of two that operate its newest process node: Intel 18A. This particular semiconductor chip production method is responsible for making the key tile, or chiplet, that lies at the heart of every Panther Lake processor. But where Intel's previous tiled architectures, Meteor Lake (MTL) and Arrow Lake (ARL), sported one design apiece, Panther Lake or PTL for short, comes in three varieties. The Panther Lake trio (Image credit: Intel) With Meteor Lake, Lunar Lake, and Arrow Lake, Intel created a single processor design and used binning strategies to create broad processor families from them. For example, one LNL chip can be found in nine different Core Ultra 200V CPUs. Not so with Panther Lake, because while binning will still be used to produce all the different models (i.e. some will have disabled cores, others will just be clocked lower), there are three chip designs in total.

Boasting a new process node to unify the best aspects of Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake , the new chip also sports an updated graphics architecture, Xe3. While it's not the Celestial graphics architecture we're hoping for in the desktop graphics card market, the beefy little iGPU should be ideal for handheld gaming. The best way to view Xe3 is to think of it as being an all-around polish and spruce up of Xe2, but one which also lays the foundation for Intel's next generation of Arc graphics processors. This is possibly why Intel settled on using the product name of 'Arc B-series' for the new iGPU, rather than giving it an entirely new name, even though the GPU architecture itself is new. I chatted to a few of Intel's senior staff at the Technology Tour event about the nomenclature, and nobody had any better explanation for using B-series as the name, so that's what I'm sticking with. As things currently stand, we'll see two implementations of Xe3 in Panther Lake when the processors officially launch at CES 2026. Panther Lake's iGPUs Image 1 of 3 (Image credi…",

Exactly how soon is yet to be confirmed, and it's not clear whether XeSS 3 will have any other notable additions or improvements. However, XeSS-MFG is definitely coming, and in games that already support XeSS-FG , you'll be able to enable 3x or 4x frame generation. This can be either in the game itself or via Intel's Graphics Software application. As it so happens, Intel has sneakily been hinting at multi-frame generation for several months, but it's only very recently that this was noticed. Hidden away in a config file was a single line titled 'Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)', but I just assumed that it was either a fairly generic label or that Intel wouldn't have anything to show for a good while. How wrong I was on both counts. So just what exactly is XeSS-MFG? Well, Intel's frame generation system works very much like Nvidia's does. The GPU renders a frame as normal and then st…",

To be more specific, we've been told what the system requirements are to have an 'Ultra++' gameplay experience and, while these requirements are no joke, EA isn't saying these will net you a mere 60 fps at 4K. No, if you have the system components required for Ultra++ gameplay, this should apparently net you 144 fps on High settings at 4K with DLSS upscaling turned on, or 240+ fps on Ultra settings at 4K with DLSS Multi Frame Generation (MFG) turned on. Achieving these frame rates at these settings will require an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor. It's interesting to note, that a Core Ultra 9 285K should achieve what the Ryzen 7 9800X3D can here, given the latter is much better for gaming. But I suppose at 4K on high and ultra settings, the CPU won't play anywhere near as large a part as the GPU. The way EA has laid out the requirements might be a little confusing, but the general gist is actually incredibly positive: Not much is really required at all to get the game running well.

Although not perfect in every aspect, its performance is outstanding, and when paired with a crisp 15.6-inch IPS panel, it thankfully delivers an exceptional gaming experience no matter what I chuck at it. Even in spite of its weird and not-wonderful SSD and RAM combo. When the Gigabyte Gaming A16 landed on my desk not long after, complete with that same RTX 5060 and a similar 1920 x 1200 IPS display, I was hopeful that perhaps the foibles Lenovo had introduced in its own model could be remedied by a brand with a bit more sensibility. A bit more gaming panache, let's say. And that's the key thing here. The Gigabyte A16 and the Lenovo Gen10 are both priced at around $1,300 or thereabouts (there's some confusion on the British front, but I'll talk about that in a bit).

Per Game Developer , the studio is laying off an indeterminate number of staff and ending development on its most recent game, which encountered a rough reception when it launched into early access in January, with players lamenting performance issues, control problems, bugs, and the fact that the game might just be a smidge too hard. \"As we wrap up our work on Hyper Light Breaker, we've had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members\", wrote the studio in a statement. \"This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances\". Heart Machine doesn't go into detail about just what circumstances it's referring to, but it's not hard to deduce at least some of them. Unlike its previous games—Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash—which both enjoy popularity and acclaim, Hyper Light Breaker currently sits at a 64% Mixed user-review rating on Steam, and I suspect it will stay there or get worse with development coming to an end. Reception is not the same thing as sales, but it hardly feels like a leap to th…",

    "body": "For those who've been eagerly waiting, finding out the exact Battlefield 6 release date and time for your region will be top priority. There's nothing quite like dropping into a Battlefield game on day one and enjoying the pure carnage and chaos of a good Conquest match. For those who played the beta, you'll know that Battlefield 6 is shaping up to be a solid instalment to the series, channelling its iconic large-scale warfare experience. Battlefield 6 is set to release on October 10, but this is different based on time zone, so when you can actually play will vary. There also isn't any early access to the game (no, not even with the deluxe edition), though pre-purchasing will get you the Tombstone Pack, which has an additional skin. For those who want to shell out even more, there's the Phantom Edition, which contains a whole heap of extra bits that are listed on the Steam page. All that said, here's the Battlefield 6 release time for each region so you know when you can start playing. Battlefield 6 release date and time for each region (Image credit: EA) The Battlefield 6 release date is October 10 for most territories, but as is generally the case with game releases, for some t…",

Well, maybe not completely, as you'll be able to receive Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for a year if you pay $30, or even for free if you live in the European Economic Area (EEA) . But those are just security updates; there will be no more feature updates for the OS and further support from developers for their apps will also slowly phase out, too. So, Windows 10 is effectively dunzo. And that fact has made me a little sadder than I thought it might. Not very sad—it's just an operating system—but a little. I was pondering why that is, because I tend to do just fine with Windows 11 and have used it pretty much since release. I think it's because of what it represents. It is, as you can see from my beautifully crafted headline above, the sound of the doors closing on the last time I felt my PC was truly my own. There are plenty of specific little things I don't particularly like about Windows 11 compared to Windows 10—the subtler taskbar icons, the simplified context menu, the strong-arming into signing into an online Microsoft account, and so on—but it's not any one little thing …",

The Steel Confessors are an interesting example, because they didn't vanish in the lore, but out here in the real world of primary sources. While references to them in White Dwarf magazine and the Index Astartes exist, the main source of detail about the Steel Confessors was a flimsy pamphlet handed out at the official Games Day & Golden Demon convention in 2005. Since nobody could source a copy of it, all the detail contained within was basically a big \"citation needed\" and has been a point of contention in the 40K fandom for 20 years.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Food and videogames have gone hand in hand since Pac-Man gobbled down his first few cherries. In games, food can represent all sorts of things: a way to replenish health or stamina, a source of power-ups or buffs, or a skill to level up while cooking over a stove or campfire. A special meal can be a gift to bestow on an NPC you're in love with, a cultural milestone in a city builder, or even a way to assassinate someone—as with Oblivion's famous poisoned apples. Since every gamer is well-versed in the importance of food, I'm giving you a culinary challenge in today's quiz. Identify the 10 games below based only on a screenshot of their food. Time to see if you can cook! It's not as easy as it sounds—if you haven't played one of the games in the quiz, you probably won't recognize its edible items—but there should be enough context in the screenshots to give you some idea of what game it's from, even if you've never chowed down on it.

Rainbow Six Siege saw a big boost in player numbers earlier this year when the X update went live, from more than 66,000 concurrents on Steam on June 9, according to SteamDB , to more than 142,000 on June 10. But it's been a downhill ride ever since, and concurrent player counts now are actually lower than they were immediately prior to the free-to-play shift. User reviews have also taken a turn downward: The overall rating on Steam remains \"very positive\" but recent reviews are \"mixed,\" with an uptick in cheaters seemingly the most common complaint. Improving Rainbow Six Siege X's anti-cheat is the first priority for the dev team: Game director Joshua Mills and creative director Alex Karpazis wrote in today's update that \"our systems in Siege X did not keep pace with the surge of cheaters that followed the move to Free Access, though we have made some progress.\" The update doesn't go into d…",
