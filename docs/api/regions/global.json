Now a new report claims it's set to be released by the end of March. According to Digitimes (via Tomshardware ), \"Windows on Arm (WoA) platform notebooks using the N1X will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\" The report claims that after the launch of an initial variant of N1X in Q1 2026, three more versions of the chip will be released in Q2. What's more, Digitimes further says that Nvidia has a follow up, codenamed N2, lined up for release in the third quarter. If all this is true it's both exciting and somewhat peculiar. After all, we've just had the CES 2026 show , which surely would have been the perfect opportunity to get the maximum number of eyeballs on what Nvidia presumably plans to be a game changing chip for the PC industry. To pass that opportunity up only to launch a month or two later? That's a bit odd. Of course, the tech industry is currently in flux thanks to the ongoing RAMpocolypse . So that could be a factor.

Then you need to go back to your ordinary life. The creator of Painkiller and current creative director of Witchfire , Adrian Chmielarz, sounds a little like a Cthulhu-stricken Lovecraft protagonist in his recent interview with Gamesindustry.biz . The cosmic entity in question? Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which has confounded executive suits and game developers alike by raking in enormous success despite being built by a core team of 30 people (and a large list of contractors) . At the very least, Chmielarz is talking from a place of comparison with Witchfire's similarly-sized team of just under 30 devs—he's cognisant of the above quibble, stating later in the interview \"we use outsourcing, and Sandfall Interactive used a lot of outsourcing\". And he boggles not at the size, but at the relative amount of novices on Sandfall's roster. \"We only wanted to work with the best,\" Chmielarz explains, \"B…",

In the meantime, Bungie's 'money maker' Destiny 2's been in a consistent decline since the release of the widely panned Lightfall expansion. Sadly, even during its prime, it felt like an uphill battle to recommend and convince other people to actually play Destiny. Bungie must've felt the same way, clearly, as it's just had to make an all-time great patch note to a back-end Steam bug: \"We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam.\" Now that's a bold strategy to boost the player count. We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam.

    "body": "Amid a memory supply crisis, in small part fueled by a shortage of NAND flash, it's perhaps unsurprising that talk of a successor would now appear. Enter ReRAM, or 'resistive random access memory.' The tech has been in development for some time, though startup Weebit Nano Limited has just signed a licensing deal with semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments to finally bring it to a broader audience. According to Weebit Nano , this agreement will see its ReRAM tech \"integrated into [Texas Instruments] advanced process nodes for embedded processing semiconductors.\" Despite what the name suggests, ReRAM isn't actually Random Access Memory, but a Non-Volatile Memory (think NAND, but not—I'll elaborate shortly). So, why is this worth getting excited about? For a start, we've not really heard a peep about the tech in a long old time, and this high-profile deal pushes it back into the spotlight. For another, ReRAM will apparently give traditional flash memory a run for its money as Weebit describes it as a \"low-power, cost-effective NVM that has proven excellent retention at high temperatures.\" To elaborate, ReRAM is non-volatile, so it's more like NAND in that it can retain data aft…",

We gave it our \"Best Setting\" award, because even though Control is pretty much a third-person shooter at heart, its presentation elevates it into something much more interesting. This is a Remedy game, after all. I don't remember a huge amount about its combat except that there's a lot of dashing, a lot of offensive levitating, and somehow office furniture is always involved. What I do remember well is the setting: Control is an action game, but it's also a very arch horror game set in the austere pebblecrete hallways of a brutalist tower called The Oldest House. Control's story and setting is often compared to the fictional SCP Foundation, which is basically hyper-conspiratorial crowdsourced weird fiction that has also inspired stuff like Lethal Company . I don't know how much more I can say to sell Control to you, and it's probably a waste of time anyway because money talks: Control is $4 on Steam at the moment.

When is the Arknights: Endfield unlock date and time? Arknights: Endfield launches at 11 am (UTC+8) on Thursday, January 22.

But after that, he says it's on employers and job seekers to, more or less, just start using AI. \"The demand side of this is a little bit like, every firm has to start by using it,\" said Nadella, throwing in some industry-standard hyperbole by calling AI a \"cognitive amplifier\" that gives you \"access to infinite minds.\" The…",

The scene would be unrecognizable without all the indie hits that first found a home on Steam, and early attempts to mimic that plumber in the red hat led to the tech that gave us Doom. So dust off that gamepad and embrace the inherent fun of jumping over stuff with me. It's a genre largely unbeleaguered by big-budget bloat, intent on retaining the purity of old-school action at its best. Platformers remain fascinated with the ability of the videogame to sate a primordial human urge: to run, be free, and soar weightlessly over certain doom. From cerebral puzzle platformers, to parkour simulations, to cotton candy collectathons, the genre is as diverse and worth celebrating as it’s ever been.

Not only did the CGI look great then, most of the visual effects in those movies still hold up well today, even decades after they were created. Nowadays, movie fans seem much less impressed by CGI in films. There's a general distaste for a perceived overuse of CGI in favor of practical effects, and there are a lot of complaints that recent CGI is less-convincing and more fake-looking than it used to be, even in the biggest budget films. In an interview with But Why Tho? , Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, Rango, and the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, was asked why visual effects in movies just don't look as good as they used to. \"I think the simplest answer is you’ve seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said. \"So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects.

It was a sticky situation for a while: Riot's decision to cancel Hytale and close Hypixel Studios after seven years of work (and for reasons that will probably never be entirely clear) seemed a definitive end to the story, but a seemingly faint hope that someone would step in to save the day became reality when Collins-Laflamme struck a deal to reacquire the whole thing in November 2025. The reborn studio managed to get the game out the door just two months later, and while it's still notably very early access, it's also pretty good . \"It’s now been 7 days since early access launch and I can confidently say that I have no regrets saving Hytale, it’s been the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life,\" Collins-Laflamme wrote. \"Thank you everyone for the amazing support, and a big thank you for the rebuilt Hytale…",

Some examples of the former include Team Fortress 2, which has 520 achievements, and Payday 2, which has a frankly ridiculous 1328.

While it lacks Tetris blocks and made-up languages, it's full of similarly mysterious characters and puzzles to uncover as you spin every level around in search of answers. The moon is gone and you, a small boy made of white cubes, are on a mission to find it. Cassette Boy begins as a legally distinct Zelda clone—you pull a sword out of a stone in the first five minutes—and transforms into something else the moment you have the power to turn the world around as many times as you'd like. Just like in Fez, the ability to peek behind solid objects, like houses and trees, in what you thought was a 2D world is an arcane power that only the strangest characters you meet seem to acknowledge.

How to get azure kelp in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) The best place to find azure kelp is in bodies of water like lakes and rivers in azure forest biomes found in Emerald Grove , the starting zone. These areas have distinctive blue trees, blueish grass (azure, you could say), and you'll often find lots of small ponds or rivers cutting through them. You can easily spot azure forests on your map, so zoom in to check if there's any water before trekking over. Search the bodies of water and you should find azure kelp, a bright blue plant that shimmers and often pokes out of the water. Since it's a plant, press F to harvest it.

We've seen plenty of 4K dual-mode monitors before. But thus far, the 1080p alt mode has run at precisely twice the refresh rate of the panel's native 4K setting. But now Asus is launching two new monitors with 1080p modes that run at 3x and 4x the refresh of their respective 4K modes. By way of example, I reviewed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG last summer . That's a 27-inch 4K model that hits 160 Hz at 4K and therefore 320 Hz at 1080p. Now there's a new version of that display, dubbed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG Gen 2. As before, it'll do 160 Hz at 4K, but now hits 480 Hz at 1080p. That latter figure should be enough to satisfy pretty serious esports gamers and in turn allow the XG27UCG Gen 2 to offer the best of both worlds in terms of 4K image detail and 1080p speed. The other newcomer is the Asus TUF Gaming VG27UQEL5A. That's another 27-inch 4K model, but this time with a native 75 Hz 4K mode and a 4x 1080p 300 Hz mode.

It reportedly comes with deceptive names like \"Upcoming_Products.pdf\" and has an attached open-source PDF reader app. In many cases, this download would come with an uncompromised RAR file, which might make the parent folder seem real. When the reader boots it up, the file sideloads a malicious DLL file, which is placed in the same directory as legitimate ones. This not only evades detection but makes the downloaded file seem totally genuine as a result. That means one could go some time without realising their PC has been compromised. Once up and running, that malicious DLL file pops a Python interpreter onto the system, which runs a script to create a registry Run key. This ensures that the Python interpreter is active on login to the system, and can even give remote access to the user. From there, bad actors can take information from the machine.

In an expanded class-action case against Nvidia, however, the accusation goes one step further, with claims that the GPU giant willingly used an illegal source of pirated books to train its models. As reported by TorrentFreak , an amended complaint (pdf warning) filed at the district court in Oakland, California last week, specifically claims that staff at Nvidia contacted a so-called 'shadow library' known as Anna's Archive, a repository of pirated books and other documents. The plaintiffs cite internal Nvidia communications as evidence, with the filed document purporting to show someone from the data strategy team at Nvidia writing, \"we are exploring including Anna's Archive in pre-training data for our LLMs.\" It continues with \"We are figuring out internally whether we are willing to accept the risk of using this data, but would like to speak with your team to get a better understanding of LLM-related work yo…",

The two duplication exploits relate to items and ammo, and basically were one of those where you dropped something and then picked it up in a particular manner to get dupes. Both of these have been fixed. Embark Studios has also \"fixed some cases where players were able to damage others from behind geometry\", which doesn't sound like it was too pleasant. Then there's the Stella Montis kinda-fix, which is an issue that's been hanging around in the game for a couple months: players anecdotally report that Embark has been replacing items for players particularly caught-out by this, though it's an open question whether certain spots persist for ne'er-do-wells to take advantage of.

With four Zen 5 cores and eight Zen 5c cores, and clocking in at a max boost clock of 5.2 GHz, it's a pretty powerful chip. Previously, Ayaneo's Konkr range has relied on Snapdragon chips, namely the G3 Gen 3 or 8 Elite. This is a step above the Android-based OS of the Snapdragon Pocket Fit . Built-in Windows support gives the handheld a boost in terms of compatibility with vast libraries of games on Steam and anti-cheat. If you're confused on the naming, the Konkr Fit is the one with an AMD chip, Windows operating system, and a larger frame. It comes with a seven-inch OLED screen. The Konkr Pocket Fit is Android-based, smaller, and presumably cheaper, with this model ranging from $299 to $329. The Pocket Fit comes with a six-inch LCD display. They look nearly identical but the Windows model is clearly much larger when viewed side-by-side. We've liked Ayaneo devices …",

It's adding two new characters, eight new balls, \"several\" more passives, and a \"nice surprise we don't want to spoil just yet\"—which all in all seems like a very robust set of features. (Image credit: Kenny Sun) While they don't sound too revolutionary, the two characters seem like fun additions to the roster. The Carouser's power is that when his balls return to him, they spin in a circle around him, which should make him particularly powerful at close range. Meanwhile the Falconer fires her balls from two birds on either side of her, who seem to sit against the walls of the stage and shoot inwards—a bit like a remix of the Cohabitants. The true Ball X Pit fiends among you will already be thinking of possible combos with other character powers.

Hong Kong-based tech creator 小宁子 XNZ has built a 3-in-1 console that swaps between a PS5, Xbox Series S, and a Switch 2 at the push of a button (via TechSpot ).

The creator calls her 3-in-1 effort the 'Ningtendo PXBOX 5,' and it turns out this hunk of hardware was no easy thing to create. Rather than simply strapping all of the hardware together (which the YouTuber demonstrates would be both unwieldy and weigh a hefty 10 kg), she stripped everything down to its electrical components and completely rethought the hardware's housing. Don't worry, no motherboards were folded ' like a book ' or otherwise harmed during this project. Noticing that individual PSUs and cooling …",

I've even seen people recreate all sorts of characters: Link, Jinx, Aang, Beast Boy, the list goes on. So why then does Hytale's very generic-looking metal armour completely cover it up? Getting armour is one of the very first things you'll want to do, too, so you look fabulous for all of five minutes, and then you end up looking like everyone else. Where's the fun in that? It's even more baffling since all of the bonus items packaged with the more expensive versions of Hytale include new cosmetics. You could spend $83.99 to get a ninja costume, a forest fairy outfit, wizard robes, or even a pop star set, only to have it obscured by boring ol' metal plate.

And if we really want it for ourselves, and we think it's cool, we'll bring it to market.\" Naturally, this leads Nilay Patel, the editor in chief of The Verge, to ask about what he calls the 'holographic anime waifu'.

    "body": "Back in the 1990s, my fellow PC chums and I thought we had stumbled across a magic trick with Windows 95, something that we thought nobody else knew about: holding the shift key when you hit restart just fired up the operating system again, not the whole PC. Alas, it turns out that we were all just very naive, and Microsoft's software engineers had deliberately coded this functionality. Yes, I know that's blatantly obvious—it's not like Windows 95 was created out of mystic spells and ground up weevils—but back then, there was surprisingly little in the way of information about the inner workings of Windows, let alone any comprehensive guides to every function and feature. In his Old New Thing blog , Raymond Chen explains the 'secret sauce' behind what was going on with the whole shift+restart trick. Just as it does now in all versions of Windows, clicking on restart in Microsoft's then massively updated Windows 95 forced the PC to initiate a cold reboot, i.e. shutdown all processes, clear the memory, and cycle the hardware. However, holding down the shift key forced a different process: the PC wouldn't restart, just the operating system itself, displaying 'Windows is restarting' o…",

That's right, how long it'll take you to get the voidhearts you need is largely down to luck. To help you out, I'll go over the best methods of getting voidhearts below.

Contrary to what you may have heard, voidhearts aren't exclusive to Void Eyes (the big floating eyes with tentacles). In fact, I've had the best luck getting them to drop from Void Spawns (the humanoid beasts with large swords).

When you find one of those in the midst of an already-ongoing sale, making it all even cheaper? Baby, that's the good stuff. Well, joyous news: you can now share that glee with your Steam pals. As spotted by SteamDB , Valve has recently pushed a change through that means you can now purchase these kinds of bundles as gifts.

A number of remedies were proposed, including Google's divestment of the Chrome browser (which will ultimately not come to pass ), and most pertinently right now that the search giant shares its data with rival companies. The DOJ secured this latter remedy among others back in September , with the US District Court ordering \"Google to make certain search index and user-interaction data available to rivals and potential rivals.\" Google is now asking to postpone the sharing of this data while it appeals the DOJ's ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly. To date, many have criticised how the DOJ is handling its case against Google, saying that many of its remedies so far have amounted to little more than ' a slap on the wrist .'

The listed specs do include 5V three-pin ARGB connectivity for controlling the ZM-VS3 DS's RGB lighting strip and USB 2.0 for hooking the display directly to a motherboard USB header, which is either kinda neat or suboptimal if you think absorbing an entire header for one tiny display limits your broader USB connectivity options.

Sporting the monikers of Performance and Efficient core (aka P-core and E-core), with the former handling the donkey work in games and the latter used for background tasks or weighing in with thread-heavy workloads, the markedly different core designs have remained front and centre in Intel's approach to all its consumer CPUs.

From the game's opening seconds it's obvious this was a massive labour of love for Harmonix, the studio that had kicked-off the whole genre with the original Guitar Hero. Many of those involved in bringing the project to life have now given interviews for The Oral History of Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Music Game Boom , a newly released book by journalist Blake Hester, with an excerpt detailing some of those initial meetings published on Design Room . The chapter begins with some of the initial enquiries and how the project got started, largely thanks to George Harrison's son Dhani already being a fan of Guitar Hero.

The Mortuary Assistant was something of a surprise hit in 2022: A game that puts players in the shoes of a fresh-out-of-college apprentice mortician who's called into work late one night to handle some unexpected embalmings. But this, it turns out, is not a normal day at the office. Your boss had the good sense to stay home, but you are not alone: Before long you're not only preparing the deceased for their funerals, you're also conducting occult rituals to ward off demonic forces. Talk about multi-tasking! I suppose it's inevitable at this point, three years after the release of the game, but the trailer for the film adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant doesn't land quite as well for me as the game did. The game, at least in the early going, is relatively subtle: Creepy as hell, yes, but things happen slowly at first, and the tension is elevated by the inherent unpleasantness (for me, anyway) of routine mortician work.

Arrowhead said on January 16, a few days after Redacted Regiment was revealed, that \"during final testing for the Warbond, we found a key issue that didn't meet our standards for a release .\" Some fans have speculated that effectively working stealth into Helldivers 2—which in my experience is very much a not -stealthy game—may have proven more complicated than expected.
