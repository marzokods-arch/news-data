You first need to place a chair—as in, a piece of decor—on something you're intending to sit atop. Go to advanced mode, and use the widget to clip your chair onto whatever you'd like to sit on. You can use the seat itself as a guide: It doesn't matter if its showing at this stage. Then you just go over to the scale tab and shrink it.

As someone who was skeptical of the value of the Expedition in Arc Raiders at first, I'm more surprised than anyone that I actually kind of like Embark's approach to the rewards now it's revealed what we're getting . You earn a special bragging rights skin for completing the base Expedition , along with 12 slots of permanent extra stash space, but also temporary boosts to XP, repairs, and Scrappy materials next season. We also get up to five skill points above the level cap for every new Raider we start, at the cost of $1 million per point in coins and stash value when the Expedition leaves. Now, yes, that is an astonishing amount of money, but I think it achieves the balance of what a Prestige mechanic is supposed to be about. Completing the Expedition is an optional grind for more invested players, but getting all five of those skill points is a grind within a grind, only for the most hardcore among us, i.e. 200-hour players…",

That's despite having already spent billions of dollars on projects for digitally enhancing our everyday world. On the plus side, we have received more information on the next Quest headset. Allegedly stated in two internal memos seen by Business Insider, Meta is reportedly pushing back the glasses to \"get the details right\". These memos are said to state that Meta needs \"breathing room\" in order to put out a \"fully polished\" device. It was originally suggested to launch in the latter half of 2026. Reports suggest Meta's MR glasses are a bit closer to goggles and even come with a power puck, like the Apple Vision Pro. If true, this would tether the device somewhat but could also allow for a more lightweight feel in the headset itself. With the current state of AI, and worries around privacy that come from someone being able to capture or stream any moment for any reason, I don't think I'm particularly excited for a world with more smart glasses in it. This is before mentioning that data taken with smart glasses will be used to train AI (unless you specifically opt out). Met…",

    "body": "Good news, an actually good Windows update is here. But it likely won't be useful for a while. Still, the foundation has been laid for your apps to update themselves thanks to the introduction of the Unified Update Orchestration Platform (UOP). The UOP will \"download and install updates based on user activity and system state\". Though rather than Windows Update, which provides patches for the OS and some applications and services, or Microsoft Store, UOP allows apps to stick to their own backend updating service. So, think of it like the OS helping apps to download updates when the system isn't in use. Apps need to be registered to the UOP via an API, but once done, they can stay up-to-date without monitoring. In a Microsoft blog back in May this year, product manager Angie Chen said UOP is a \"Unified future for app updates\", as it will work with both Windows and non-Windows apps. Windows will then provide a unified app update history for all updates on the system, so all in one place. (Image credit: Microsoft) As of right now, no apps actually utilise UOP, but users on the Dev and Beta channels will slowly start to get access.

    "body": "Beyerdynamic is no stranger to our list of best gaming headphones and for good reason. Its MMX 330 Pro cans are supremely comfortable, the open-back design with STELLAR.45 drivers makes games, music, and everything in between sound phenomenal. But it's not perfect. Aside from the obvious lack of microphone for game chat, it's also not the most portable headset for gaming on the go. So in an attempt to remedy this, Beyer has introduced a lighter, closed back headphone with an easily detachable cable that can work both 3.5mm and USB-C. The new, smaller, Beyerdynamic DT 270 Pro can't beat my beloved DT 900 Pro X in sheer performance and comfort but it can certainly pack down into my backpack a helluva lot easier while still giving me that sweet, sweet Beyerdynamic sound. The design language is pure Beyerdynamic minimalism. Matte black cups, spring-steel headband, understated padding—no RGB strips, no gamer logos, nothing you'd be embarrassed to wear out and about. Though, while I wouldn't say it feels cheap, it certainly lacks the panache of its more expensive siblings. At just 194 grams, it feels impossibly light compared to most gaming headsets, yet it barely shifts on your head du…",

A good chunk of the post is dedicated to his interactions with the community over the last three decades. \"My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas,\" he said. \"I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.\" Harada said that those experiences \"became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator,\" something which continued even as both Tekken and the FGC at large grew bigger. \"Many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for…",

This was to be known already, given the sheer volume of NPCs you talk to when you're running around in the thing—'tis a fact that is self-evident. But did you know exactly how much spoken dialogue, down to the very second? Well, one fan, who seems to've done the legwork, is able to answer that question: 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds. User Everwhite-moonlight on the Baldur's Gate 3 subreddit has compiled a spreadsheet that tallies not only the hours spoken by each character (and their respective voice actor), but also the amount of files they speak in. For example, Amelia Tyler, who voices the game's silk-toned narrator, is understandable top billing at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds of chatting—over a brain-boggling 7,629 files. Hilariously, Astarion takes the prize for biggest yapper in all of Baldur's Gate, just one hour shy of beating out the main character's literal inner monologue: 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. Larian's work is even more impressive when Everwhite-moonlight tallies it up, though: \"There are about 173,642 voice files in the game with the combine…",

The Zagreus Journey mod adds a third option to your choice of how to leave the Crossroads, a Chaos Gate labeled \"Descend into Nightmare\". Jump inside and you'll be back in Tartarus, with all the old shades and traps to contend with, before working your way up through Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx. Even the original game's soundtrack is carried over. What isn't carried over is Zagreus himself, and so you'll be playing as Melinoë (and whichever familiar you bring), with one of her keepsakes equipped, and encountering the pantheon and earning the boons of Hades 2. The sequel's magic-heavy, dash-light combat seems to work commendably against the first game's enemies, though they have had their hit points and numbers buffed to keep them challenging when facing the kind of endgame builds you'll presumably be throwing at the…",

The biggest shock for me is that the memetically terrifying Bell Bearing Hunter isn't even in the top three for deadliest field bosses: He's beaten by Erdtree Avatar, Draconic Tree Sentinel, and Royal Carian Knight in rising order.

There's an escort mode with a playable civilian class, four-team modes, jump pads, new weapons like the nail gun, dynamite pack, and tranquilizer gun, and more. But that's not the reason for its renaming. As the modders explained , \"Valve requested a few months ago that we rename our mod, because the name Team Fortress 2 Classic was too similar to their Team Fortress Classic.\" \"We've learned that various other mods have recently used the word 'classic' in ways that unintentionally made them look like official Valve products, and as a result, Valve had a new policy put in place back in September.\" Choosing a new name was \"surprisingly difficult\" both because they wanted a name that meant they could retain the TF2C abbreviation, and \"it quickly became apparent that few options actually embodied what we set out to do better than 'classic' had. …",

Notably, Stray's developer, BlueTwelve, and publisher, Annapurna, are mostly in the background of this story. As reported by Gematsu back in 2022, Skybound and iam8bit handled distribution of physical PS5 copies of the game, with iam8bit offering a special edition, as well as a vinyl record of the game's soundtrack. According to the suit, which is seeking over $4 million in damages, \"Skybound failed to provide the monthly reports as agreed,\" referring to financial records related to the partnership. \"It also padded its expenses with millions of dollars in fake line items.\" With regards to Stray, iam8bit alleges that Skybound used insider information⁠—including confidential details of iam8bit's royalty split with Annapurna⁠—to cut the smaller company out of a distribution deal for the subsequent Nintendo Switch physical edition of Stray.

Skarven's first trailer is all mood and light on action. The player approaches a lonely country house with an industrial mill looming behind. In Danish, a TV anchor drops some crumbs of world building as the player creeps through the house: We're seeing a rising retirement age and increased labor automation thanks to a Children of Men-style bottoming out in fertility rates. We pick up a chunky, Fallout 10mm-looking pistol, the TV cuts out, and a freaky, Nihilanth -type dude pops out to attack. I'm digging what I see, including an oppressive northern European dreariness, some great sci-fi/alt history scene setting, and stellar art direction, which pairs Mathorne's style with early aughts, PS2 vibes, but \"how you remember it.\" I'm reminded of Nightdive's approach to the System Shock Remake, which boasted high-fidelity assets paired with deliberately noisy, pixelated textures.

One that could serve as the perfect ambience for my day-to-day life: working, cooking, cleaning, and unwinding with a glass of wine and my Steam Deck. And what better fodder for my super chill, super relaxing playlist than videogame music? After all, its entire purpose is to create ambience. It's vibes personified. Instead of telling you how it's feeling, it's trying to tell you how you should feel. Ooh, don't you feel so fuzzy and nostalgic as I play the flute in this quaint woodland village? Isn't the sul ponticello on this violin making you scared? You get my point. I have long championed soft piano pieces from JRPGs as the ultimate relaxation music, but I've found myself branching out to some less likely candidates as of late.

The result is one of the best strategy games of the last decade. \"While the inspiration is clear, it would be a disservice to imply that it's mainly trading in nostalgia,\" Fraser Brown wrote in his Northgard review , awarding it a score of 84%. \"This Viking saga builds on the history-themed RTS romps of the '90s, but it's not beholden to them.\" Northgard went on to sell over 5 million copies and receive a bunch of expansions and DLC. Now, developer Shiro Games has bundled several of these additional adventures with the base game to form Northgard: Definitive Edition , which throws in a few new features for good measure. Chiefly, the Definitive Edition combines the base game with the Cross of Vidar expansion, which introduces a new campaign where you must guide your Viking Clan through new lands in a post Ragnarök world.

So popular, in fact, that it's even a surprise to developer ArenaNet. The game's recent remaster, Guild Wars Reforged , launched Wednesday as a free update for existing players and an inexpensive way to get in for newbies. While most Guild Wars fans are on to the game's more traditionally MMO-ish sequel , Reforged still brought the game's concurrent player peak on Steam up to over 5,000 at time of writing, according to SteamDB . That may not sound like a lot, but it's floated for the last several years at around 200-600, and since the game came to Steam relatively late in its life, there's likely a big contingent of people playing on the standalone client available on ArenaNet's website (anecdotally, that's how I play both Guild Wars games when the mood strikes).

In the clip, Lucy is up in the mouth of Dinky the T-Rex, the enormous plaster dinosaur that looks over the Dino Dee-lite motel and served once as the Dino Bite gift shop—as well as the sniper perch for Boone, the (unquestionably) best companion in Fallout: New Vegas. Take a look: As we can see in the clip, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) have been running a scam that sounds a bit like the con from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: turn over an outlaw (in this case, The Ghoul) to the authorities (who appear to be the Great Khans, a faction from Fallout: New Vegas) and collect the bounty. Then, while the outlaw is being hanged, shoot the rope and \"use whatever violence necessary\" to kill everyone and escape with both the money and their lives. Little snag, I guess: Lucy, the former Vault-dweller, is a nice person, and is reluctant to shoot The Ghoul free while he dangles there at the end of the rope, much to his di…",

Tagawa was a classic 'that guy' actor, with IMDB listing credits in more than 140 films and television shows going back to an uncredited appearance in the 1986 Kurt Russell classic Big Trouble in Little China. It didn't take long for bigger roles to follow: I recall seeing him first in an episode of Babylon 5 (yes, I am a B5 nerd), in which he played a cool, quiet, capable guy who took care of a problem while other people focused on other things—a description that could probably be applied to many of his roles, really. Tagawa appeared in everything from big-budget films to long-forgotten TV series over his long career. In 1987 he was \"Asian buyer\" in an episode of MacGyver and \"Thug in Flashback\" in the low-budget action flick Bulletproof; he also had a speaking role as Chang in The Last Emperor, which won nine Academy Awards that same year.

    "body": "Until I found the website ooh.directory last year, I hadn't really understood, completely, how malnourished my internet diet had become. I still had some bookmarks I visited everyday, and the social media feed I checked (too often) for breaking news and interesting stories. But only when I made a conscious effort for the first time in a decade to fill up an RSS reader with bloggers, critics, news sources, and even webcomics did I realize that I'd lost track of the original, primal joy of the internet: Clicking a link and finding a whole new world unfurl before me, as fast as my dial-up modem or DSL connection could load it in. I suppose I started taking this experience for granted at some point; once we all came to understand the internet as an infinite repository for knowledge, the obvious goal became accessing that knowledge more efficiently. It's not that I ever really stopped clicking on links. I just stopped putting in the work of looking for websites through directory listings, like the ones I used to love browsing on Yahoo.com for hours at a time ( Home > Recreation > Games > Video Games > Emulation , anyone?). I realize in hindsight that that was the really magical part, n…",

    "body": "World of Warcraft 's player housing feature has been out for less than a week—well, in early access, as long as you've bought the upcoming Midnight expansion—and I'm delighted to report that players are already going hogwild. For context, player housing has taken notes from every other popular MMO's housing system and basically rolled it into one. It's got its issues, like outdoor decor limits being somewhat stingy at present—but Blizzard has otherwise hit the nail on the head. Objects can be scaled, rotated, and clipped into each other to your heart's content, which has already led to some excellent creations. I'll be getting stuck in over the weekend—until then, however, I'm stuck here getting paid to write about videogames. Which means I can live vicariously through the many homeowners currently showing off their creations on the unofficial WoW subreddit. Take, for example, this large hadron collider, made by user IInnsmouth : \"I know Gazlowe is proud of me,\" they write, before presumably destroying their entire neighbourhood in a black hole. Just made the CERN Large Hadron Collider in my home. from r/wow User Avellaa , meanwhile, has taken advantage of the scaling function to …",
