Barone said shortly after confirming the Stardew Valley 1.7 update is on the way that \"it’s hard to just stop improving it when there are still things that can be improved,\" but in a more recent post he pretty strongly implied that there's a lot more in the pipe than just improvements. \"There will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type,\" Barone wrote in response to a user who asked for a hint about the update. \"Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet.\" (Image credit: Eric Barone (Twitter)) Keeping his cards close to the vest is Barone's way: We didn't get the full skinny on the 1.6 update until it went live in March 2024, although Barone did have fun winding everyone up with \" one patch note per day \" teases. You can get away with that sort of thing when you've made what is basically the most popular indie videogame in the history of humanity.

That's per an interview with TheGamer , wherein Larian CEO Swen Vincke told the site that it's facing issues with \"the price of RAM and the price of SSDs and fuck, man. It's like, literally, we've never had it like this\". The problem is, it seems, the slow pace of game development—especially if you're Larian, you're going to be designing architecture for a game that'll be both simultaneously coming out in a few years but also releasing now, so figuring out a level of optimisation that's reasonable (while still making the thing look good) takes a bit of soothsaying. \"It kind of ruins all of your projections that you had about,\" he explains, \"because normally, you know the curves, and you can protect the hardware. It's gonna be an interesting one. It means that most likely, we already need to do a lot of optimization work in early access that we didn't necessarily want to do at that point in time.\" …",

Why? Crandall, who has worked at Kingston for 29 years, says the company is experiencing NAND wafer price spikes the likes of which have never been seen before. In conversation with Mark Hachman on The Full Nerd Network podcast , Crandall got specific, saying there's been \"a 246% increase in NAND pricing as compared to Q1 of 2025.\" He later goes on to elaborate, \"We just recently saw a 70% increase in NAND costs over… I think it was a 60-day period. So, that 250% I mentioned earlier—70% of that was increased within the last 60 days.\" As NAND flash chips make up about 90% of a single SSD's Bill of Materials cost, that's an especially eye-watering uptick for both businesses and general consumers alike. As such, Crandall offers a word of advice to anyone considering upgrading their rig's storage: \"Do it now and [don't] wait, because prices are going to continue to go up.\" In other words, we've yet to see just how high SSD prices can go.

And at first glance, a report that Nvidia is planning on cutting discrete GPU production by up to 40% just seems like a case in point. However, while it is all RAM-related, it's not necessarily bad tidings. The claim in question was posted on the Chinese Board Channels forum (via Benchlife and Overclock3D ) and basically claims that Nvidia is set to reduce the supply of its gaming GPUs by between 30% and 40% in the first half of 2026, compared to the volume of output during the same period in 2025. That's not surprising given that the DRAM supply problems, affecting the entire computing industry, will result in fewer desktop and laptop PCs being shipped next year. Given just how many of them typically sport an Nvidia discrete GPU, either soldered onto the motherboard or in the form of a third-party graphics card, the demand for RTX Blackwell chips is obviously going to plummet. However, there's not exactly a huge shortage of GeForce RTX 50-series cards at the moment, with the exception of sensibly priced RTX 5080 and 5090 models.…",

But honestly, all I ever really wanted was a good skin. A nice unique cosmetic was always my primary motivation for doing the Expedition project, not just because of the bragging rights, but because I like cosmetic options in games. Maybe it's the sicko Destiny 2 player in me talking, but character fashion is properly important. With the Expedition rewards announcement that we were getting the \"Patchwork skin\", but with no visual reveal, a lot of players were worried that Embark was referring to a pretty unappealing skin from the server slam. But now the Expedition window has actually opened up and we can see a thumbnail of the outfit, things are looking good . As TheWreckedTitan points out on Reddit, the Expedition skin is most likely the tutorial skin we all wore at the start of the game, a cool little cosmetic that makes you look like y…",

But first, it's time to butter up executive producer Jonathan Nolan. Bethesda execs have previously spoken about how a Fallout adaptation could've come much sooner, except Howard didn't want the usual \"videogame directors\" to come in and make a hash of it . But Nolan, co-writer on the likes of Westworld, Interstellar, and the Dark Knight trilogy? \"It turned out he was a huge fan of Fallout,\" Howard told the BBC's Newsbeat , adding that the two have become \"very close friends\" working on the show. \"Everyone involved is on the same page with how they want to treat it with authenticity.\" That authenticity is what led to an early decision that the TV show would be \"canon\" within the Fallout universe.

    "body": "The Steam recap for 2025 is now live : and you know what that means! Honey, it's time for your regularly scheduled \"thinking about numbers too much\" session. Buckle up, I'm about to get theoretical— hypothetical, even. As you can find out for yourself by opening Steam and clicking the big \" Steam Replay \" button on the storefront, the percentage playtime spent by all Steam users in 2025 on games, released in the same year, was 14%. Valve doesn't share its exact working, here, but I'm happy to assume that the company makes an effort to bar completely inactive accounts in these tallies, because Steam's been kicking for over 22 years at this point—if it didn't, that number would be a lot smaller. I'm also made more reasonably confident by the fact that this is a pattern that's held (somewhat) stable for four years now—with only one outlier in 2023. As we noted last year , the historical data for this same statistic are as follows: Players spent 17% of their time on same-year releases in 2022… 9% in 2023 and 15% in 2024. With 14% of players doing so in 2025, it's starting to become a safe bet to assume that number will, on your average calendar year, hang around the 15% mark. As far a…",

    "body": "The Groundbreaking quest in Arc Raiders has a rather tricky step in which you have to track down a building drawn on a whiteboard with no other clues. Similar to Armored Transports , you also require a Blue Gate Communication Tower Key to even see the board in the first place, since it's inside a locked room. While there is a spare key you can grab on the way, it has a similar problem to Armored Transports—the one quest I have still not completed for this very reason. If you lose the key, it's basically up to RNG whether you get another, so you're a bit stuck. Luckily, the locked room at Pilgrim's Peak, where you have to go, has a lot more foot traffic, so chances are even without the key, you'll still be able to get it. No free loadout this time; you'll want a safe pocket to stow the key Apollo gives you until you need to use it. Otherwise, here's how to complete Groundbreaking, including where to find the locked room, and how to find the building pictured on the whiteboard. Enter the locked room at Pilgrim's Peak and search for any construction research You can find Pilgrim's Peak in the northeast of the Blue Gate (Image credit: Embark Studios) Your first step will be heading to…",

But right off the bat in Fallout Season 2, Episode 1, we get to see a location I remember fondly from one of the Fallout games—and surprisingly, it has absolutely nothing to do with New Vegas at all. Thinking about it, this location is probably the place I've spent the most time out of all of the Fallout games I've played. When it showed up in the episode, I immediately got a buffout-sized dose of nostalgia. As the kids say, it hit me right in the feels. (Apologies if the kids no longer say this.) In Episode 1, Lucy and the Ghoul are following Hank's bloody footprints through the desert from California to Nevada, and they discover he made a stop at a location players of Fallout 4 are sure to recognize: the Starlight Drive-In Theatre.

Case in point: Hank MacLean, played by Kyle MacLachlan in Prime Video's Fallout series. Hank is the ultimate business zealot. Before the bombs fell, Hank was so dedicated to his work at Vault-Tec that he voluntarily had himself cryogenically frozen for a couple centuries. He got thawed out, married a Vault-dweller named Rose, had two kids, and then murdered 30,000 people with an A-bomb. All in the name of business. And he was just getting started! In the final episode of Season 1, Hank saw his daughter learn what a monster he was, left her behind to mercy-kill her ghoulified mother, then stomped his way across the desert to reach New Vegas. As Season 2 begins we see that Hank has not been shattered by the consequences of his evil acts: he's actually invigorated and ready for more. Discovering that the front desk at Vault-Tec has collected over 400,000 unread messages over the past two centuries actually b…",

Rex, and one of the most mysterious cut locations from Fallout: New Vegas . I'm of course talking about Vault 24. Over the course of Fallout's life, there have been many iconic Vaults mentioned and featured in games. Many were the childhood homes of our protagonists and player characters—like Lucy's own Vault 33, or Vault 13 from the OG Fallout. But the vaults run the gamut from capsules of Americana to harrowing psychological experiments. Here are just some of the more interesting examples: Vault 4 (TV Show): In season 1, we saw Lucy and Maximus explore Vault 4, the previous home of a group of scientists who experimented with mutants and Wastelanders. Vault 11 (New Vegas): A social experiment took place to see how willing people would be to sacrifice others for the safety of the majority.

I think I'm best behind the camera.” Spoiler alert for Season 1, obviously. This scene is one of the revelations that occurs towards the end of that season, and is a flashback to how Vault-Tec executives and various other business big-hitters divide the various vault experiments between themselves before they agree to drop the bombs. Having Howard in there would've seemed like a pretty neat nod to me, but perhaps an executive from a company owned by Microsoft participating in a corporate carve-up to humanity's detriment would've been too on-the-nose. The interviewer pushes Ho…",

By provoking controversy, Horses has clearly done part of its job as a work of art, although after playing it, I was disappointed that it didn't fully take advantage of its potential as a game. It's visually strong and thematically coherent, and a fascinating attempt to explore topics and tones in games that have often been reserved for film, but it struggles to integrate the experience of the player in a way that doesn't distract from its point. The horses are people, if you hadn't noticed yet In Horses, you play a young man, Anselmo, who's sent to stay and work for two weeks on a farm. The farm is populated mainly by naked humans wearing horse masks. Bad things happen on the farm. To be extremely blunt about Horses' themes: this is an intentionally disturbing game about fear, repression, inherited violence, and societal control.

Stellar Blade was Shift Up's debut release on Steam, which naturally exposed it to a much wider Western audience. Of course it was a different sort of exposure that put Stellar Blade over the top with a certain portion of gamers, but beneath all the silly T&A was a reasonably solid action game that put up more than three million copies sold across PC and PS5 as of July 2025.

At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs.

So when ZSA offered to send over its Voyager keyboard, along with its new Navigator trackball module, I had high expectations. Essentially, the Voyager is a pared-down Moonlander, with all excess fat trimmed away to leave as minimal a keyboard as possible. \"Laptop-friendly,\" says ZSA's marketing. \"Goes anywhere—on your desk or on the road.\" I certainly can't argue with that because with just 52 keys and a total thickness of just 16 mm (0.62 inches), the Voyager is as whisper-thin as you could want. However, both the thickness and key count result in some notable compromises. For example, there's no wireless connectivity option because batteries would add to the weight, cost, and size of the keyboard.

Videogame musical? Hell yeah— I dug Stray Gods' blend of musical theatre and visual novel —and a turn-based RPG to boot? The little Final Fantasy sicko who's been living in my brain for the last 20 years is hootin' and hollerin' right now. The game first made an appearance during our very own PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct , and last week's Day of the Devs gave us an extended look at one of the songs that'll be in the game, Under the Lights. It feels a little K-Pop Demon Hunters in tone, and I'm definitely interested to see what other tracks People of Note has tucked under its belt. That's partly because Jason Charles Miller—a name you'll most certainly recognise if you're as Final Fantasy 14-brained as I am, vocalist behind tracks like To The Edge and Close in the Distance—is the co-writer behind nine of the songs in People of Note. I have to admit that has me a little jazzed. With game director Jason Wishnov promising the discography will journey through the likes of \"rock, EDM, and so many…",

Board Channels (login required, via Videocardz ) claims that the last new RTX 3060s will filter through supply channels in December, after which availability of the GPU will end. We first reviewed the RTX 3060 way back in February 2021 . So, it's had an exceptionally long run of nearly five years. It's thought Nvidia stopped producing the GA106 GPU dies upon which the RTX 3060 is based some time in 2024. But it takes a while for those dies to work their way through the system. \"This Nvidia RTX 3060 series has been sold for a long time. Although Nvidia stopped producing this GPU a while ago, board partners still had remaining inventory on hand,\" Board Channels says. \"Brands such as Colorful, Taiwanese vendors, and Galax mostly cleared their inventory around September or October. After that, only Zotac still had the largest RTX 3060 stock on hand, and it was fully cleared during November. That means genuinely new RTX 3060 cards have now been completely sold through, and from this month the card is said to be officially exiting the marke…",

While the developer is keeping most of its next game, Divinity , secret for now, we still pried loose a few details about Larian's \"biggest most ambitious RPG yet,\" including the style of combat, broad technical advancements, and how representative that wildly dark and violent reveal trailer is of the game as a whole. Don't get your hopes up about a release date, though—Larian isn't throwing any days, months, or even years out yet. But if you were worried that cinematic teaser meant Divinity was just starting pre-production, we've got some good news. Read on for a quick overview of the key things we learned straight from Larian. 1.

    "body": "I was worried about Fallout Season 2. The dud second season is a cliché in TV just like it is in sport—the sophomore slump where a show loses its spark. Amazon should know this well, having turned a bunch of The Rings of Power's second season into a weird rehash of Star Wars with Tom Bombadil as Yoda. And though I didn't hate the second season of The Witcher, it was a shame to lose the twisty structure of the first season's jumbled timeline, which relied on viewers spotting details to untangle which events took place when, and not gain anything nearly as thinky to replace it. So I went into Fallout Season 2 with concerns. For starters, I expected the pre-war flashbacks to become vestigial, hurried past to get on with the modern day story of Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Praise be to the Atom then, that the flashbacks remain central. Barb continues making moral compromises on behalf of her family and Coop keeps finding out about corporate shenanigans that force him to become involved. But usually the reason TV shows disappoint in their second season is, while the first season can focus on introducing the core cast, the second needs to broaden things to keep generating new story.

It's very easy to learn, very hard to master, but it allows you to do fantastic things, which is the most important bit. \"It's going to give you a really good time figuring things out, and how you can chain things to one another and come up with all kinds of shenanigans.\" When asked whether Divinity would be turn-based and have a similar party size to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke responded in the affirmative. Baldur's Gate 3, as well as both Original Sin games, allow four characters in your active party at any time. So while Vincke didn't provide the exact number, four seems like a sure bet.

Rather than try to shoehorn our favourite games into a handful of fixed categories, we ask each member of the team to nominate up to six games released this year. Then we tally up the votes, hop into a big, global call, and argue over which games are worthy of an award—as well as picking our Game of the Year itself. Once the games are chosen, we assign award categories based on what quality we think that game specifically excels at. That's why there's a different selection of categories each year. And what a year it's been—full of surprises, some disappointments, and a handful of games that dominated the conversation throughout.
