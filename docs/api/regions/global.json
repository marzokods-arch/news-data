    "body": "Since Battlefield 6's first multiplayer beta, a contingent of players have held firmly to a fundamental criticism: The maps are too damn small. Ensuing weeks of heated debate have seen some longtime Battlefield veterans venting frustration with BF6's tightly-corseted combat corridors, while others have insisted those of us longing for broader battlezones are suffering from nostalgia poisoning. Thanks to the efforts of community cartographic analysts, however, we now have a more definitive assessment of whether BF6's maps are up to scale. Redditors ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC painstakingly compared the playable areas of Battlefield maps from Battlefield 3 forwards, and yes—based on their measurements, the map selection in BF 6 is more cramped than in previous games. (Image credit: /u/ClaraTheRed and /u/PENGUINonPC) To assess the dimensions and playable areas of Battlefield's maps, ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC devised their own process of recording the distances from a player's position to that map's HQ and control points. Using those measurements, they resized images of the overhead view of each in-game map until they shared a scale of 1 pixel per meter. \"There's always the risk of …",

How do I react? Immediately pop a shield recharger of course. Then I take one more shot to the body and die. Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.

That's very good indeed—what's less good is that 355,000 people playing all at the same time put a little extra strain on the game's servers, and there was, as Embark put it, a wobble . Reports of Arc Raiders server issues began popping up on Reddit in the early afternoon (Eastern time) on November 2, as eager players ran headlong into login and matchmaking issues. The cause of the outage was no great mystery: WE PEAKED AND NOW THE ARC BROKE THE SERVERS! from r/ArcRaiders Evidence of the servers struggle can be seen on SteamDB , where a high of nearly 338,000 concurrent players was achieved before sudden palpitations threw everything into disarray.

    "body": "Memory has been in a weird spot as of late. The increased demands presented by the rise of AI , plus the expansion of data centres, stock shortages, and the winding down of DDR4 have all left the typical gamer caught out in the rain. Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board. This unwillingness to lock in prices is likely linked to the sudden demand/memory shortage, and Digitimes reports that Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are all likely …",

Sundberg, who left Avalanche Studios in 2019, said that Just Cause 5 'would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.\" Now, it doesn't immediately follow that changes in personnel means a developer will stop iterating upon a particular series. None of Doom's original creators still work at id Software, for example, but the studio keeps making great spins on its world-changing FPS.

Consider Dragon Age; born as a CRPG, forced to live through little chips and nicks that turned it into a third-person action game with RPG elements. I mean, I get it on paper. Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element. But as we've gone on, I'm growing less and less convinced that this idea—that we simply cannot handle anything more difficult, or it'll hurt our walnut gamer brains—was ever true.

LGBT people and women more generally face repression in Saudi Arabia , while Kushner, of course, has strong ties to a Trump administration which has made attacking LGBT rights a cornerstone of its platform. The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements.

The best locations are around the cars in Scrap Yard, and in the lower floors of Water Treatment Control, and Primary Facility on Dam Battlegrounds , as it's easy to loot all three areas in a single run, and there are multiple extraction points nearby.

In 2023, Asus took over the NUC product line and started creating mini PCs alongside Intel parts. Dropping the NUC name here is presumably a choice made due to the AMD CPU the GR70 is packing. Asus isn't dropping the NUC branding entirely, however, as the Intel-powered 2025 version of the ROG NUC , using the exact same chassis design, has been around since the summer.

But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell.

According to the latest Windows 11 Insider notes , that software is starting to roll out to other non-Xbox devices, and MSI is first in line. As of today, those in the Windows 11 Insider dev or beta channels will have the option of accessing the Windows Full Screen Experience on the MSI Claw range of handhelds. In order to get it on your Claw, you need to be on the latest Insider Preview Build of Windows 11 (KB5067115), then you have to go into the gaming section of the Settings menu, and enable 'full screen experience'. As it's in a staged rollout, you may not see it when you boot your device up, but it should hopefully arrive over the next few weeks or so. The full-screen experience functions primarily as a UI overlay for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, and makes a Windows device feel a little closer to a console. It aggregates all your games from different storefront…",

But it seems this wasn't enough to right Heart Machine's ailing vessel, as the studio began a second round of layoffs late last week. This time the cuts were focussed on the team creating the side-scrolling action/adventure Possessor(s), occurring less than a fortnight before the game is due to launch.

Street Racing Syndicate arrived on PC a year later, and while it was no Need For Speed Underground or Burnout 2: Point of Impact, it found fans among those who enjoyed customizing its roster of licensed cares, free-roaming its Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Miami maps, and outrunning the police. What players didn't like was a bug specific to the PC version that made the sun blindingly bright on daylight tracks. \"HOW TO REMOVE THE SUN? LOL\" asks one poster on the Steam forum, while another laments, \"I guess the developers never heard of windshield visors or sunglasses.\" Wait long enough, and eventually a hero will come along—in this case a modder by the name of Radzerg, who just released a patch with the simple declaration, \"I've fixed the sun\".

It also comes with an interactive documentary about the history of the gory fighting series, à la The Making of Karateka . Sounds like the complete package. Yet, within days of release, 55% of its Steam reviews are negative . \"Input lag is unacceptably high in every game—even offline\" says one, with some players complaining it's even noticeable in the menus. Others are upset that \"the online's in a terrible state. Quick play matches with random people only. You can't queue for more than one game at a time, so the community's splintered between games.\" Another laments, \"The 360/PS3 MK Kollection that came out over 10+ years ago had better netcode than this\".

If you play enough competitive shooters, you'll learn pretty quickly about the tricks graphics settings can play on you. Arc Raiders is the newest shooter with a foliage problem and you might not realize it's holding you back—especially if you're a sweaty PvPer. Knee-high bushes and other shrubbery can be toggled on or off through the foliage graphics setting, and you probably want it on \"low\". YouTuber staycation provides a good example of the difference with some bushes around a car. With the \"epic\" setting, the bushes obscure some of the ground around the edges of the car, which could make it hard to see someone at a distance.

You've collected every coin. Done every side quest. Spoken to every single NPC. S-ranked every level. Now, at last, the ultimate reward: an all-out fight against one final boss complete with an epic song that usually encapsulates your hours of hard work and your character's growth into some freakishly powerful being. For me, most of my exposure to boss themes growing up came through the endless stream of JRPGs I played. Final Fantasy 7's One Winged Angel will be the one that springs to mind for a lot of people, but I'm an absolute sucker for Final Fantasy 6's Dancing Mad—a whopping 18-minute, four-movement symphony that plays when facing off against Kefka Palazzo. (Image credit: Eidos Montreal) I'll also forever adore the final battle in Kingdom Hearts 2, where Yoko Shimomura takes a far more stripped-back approach with gentle piano and vocals that almost feel like the antithesis of a big boss battle—eerily calm and unsettling all at once.

Every other week, I'll be sharing my thoughts on the genre, interviewing fellow MMO-heads like me, taking a deep-dive into mechanics we've all taken for granted, and, occasionally, bringing in guest writers to talk about their MMO of choice. Alright, let me roll up my sleeves and deliver unto you some lore . Not just any lore: mod lore . Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently. World of Warcraft has historically embraced AddOn creators with open arms, giving a ton of the game's information to them in-client through its API. Crack open the shell of any WoW raider's client and you'll find a homebrew moonshine concoction of custom raid frames, sound effects, and WeakAuras telling them what buttons to push and when. In fact, Blizzard was so dependent on its AddOn community that two things wound up happening. First, it didn't overhaul its user interface until 2022 . Blizzard spent 18 whole years assuming that any player who didn't want to wrestle with…",

I've always been more of a lurker, spending hours scrolling through social media admiring everyone's commitment to their favourite characters, and I am constantly impressed by the creativity the cosplay community showcases. Character Select Welcome to Character Select, a weekly column where PC Gamer takes a look at the art and cosplay created by you. Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. It's been a big weekend for all sorts of cosplayers with MCM ComicCon and EGX in London, and the turnout of people rocking up dressed in their nerdiest best has not disappointed. So, instead of saving all of my favourites to a folder I'll inevitably visit once in a blue moon, trying to convince myself I'll sink more time into cosplay one of these days, I thought I'd share them with you…",
