Why is Helldivers 2 roughly 150GB on PC, and around a third that size on consoles? Armstrong says it's all down to a proportion of the PC playerbase who still have hard disk drives (HDD) rather than solid-state drives (SSD). His full explanation follows but, essentially, Arrowhead duplicates a tonne of information in order to make the game load faster for those on HDDs (which matters because no match starts until all players have loaded the mission, regardless of hardware). \"An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data,\" says Armstrong ( thanks, VGC ). \"The time it takes for this arm to 'seek' or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck. \"To solve this problem, we deliberately duplicate certain data files (like a common tree texture or a sound effect) and place copies of them in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game.

In a blog post titled \" Meta Horizon Engine at a glance \", Meta says the new engine focuses on a few major points: The first is 'Scalability from cloud to mobile', which is effectively the ability to run worlds on the cloud, and then on mobile devices. It mentions the idea of \"running on mobile phones\", which suggests you will be able to play worlds natively, which you couldn't do prior. The second is \"speed and performance\". Meta claims worlds \"load and run quickly\" with its new engine. The third is \"familiar tools\", and it says Horizon Engine will work with templates and formats that are designed to be familiar to developers. Given that Horizon Worlds are user-made, this could speed up production and lower the skill ceiling. The last element is \"platform evolution\". Effectively, Meta argu…",

Gird your game libraries because October is a hell of a lot bigger than that. There are five games near the top of Steam's most-wishlisted chart all launching this month. October does tend to be a big month for game launches, and big games do tend to gain momentum to the top of the wishlist pile the month of release. Occasionally we'll see months where two or three majorly anticipated games are all stumbling over each other but five? I'm calling uncle. It's the kind of month that really feels like the apex of a rollercoaster, or like the little adrenaline rush that makes ye olde loot boxes so addictive. Not quite like the gauntlet of summer 2023 where we got Diablo 4, Baldur's Gate 3, and Starfield all in quick succession, but it could come close.

But future generations will have to learn this lesson from someone else. Probably in Roblox or something. Why? Because Molyneux recently sat down with Edge to reflect on a long career of making extravagant promises about acorns, and in the process he mentioned that, yeah, his upcoming game, Masters of Albion , is going to be his last. \"Masters of Albion is a redemption title for me,\" said Molyneux. \"But also, it's my last game. It just is.\" Molyneux, it seems, is feeling his age. \"I'm 66 years old. I'm working as hard as I've ever worked in my life. And I just haven't got the life energy left to do this again.\" My almost kneejerk response to which is 'pull the other one, Molyneux.'

It's just you, and whatever furniture and decor you've picked up. Twinkleby takes this satisfaction of bringing life to empty spaces and creates an entire game out of it. When I first played the demo in May, I shared how I was getting to a point where I felt exhausted with decorating in games because of a little voice telling me it needed to be picture-perfect. After spending about half an hour with the demo, I was reminded that the visual appeal doesn't matter as long as you're having fun. Having now played hours of the full game, I'm pleased to announce this feeling never fizzles out and once you're past the first couple of islands.

That's the reason for a device such as this one from Ampinel, which keeps a graphics card's power demands in check across the compact 12VHPWR and 12V-2X6 connectors. The Ampinel from aqua computer is a small device that connects to a graphics card's power connector. It's compatible with any GPU using the modern 16-pin connector, ie most of the RTX 40- and 50-series cards. It works by monitoring the current and voltage being delivered to a graphics card, though unlike other devices that do much the same thing, it actively distributes load across the connector to ensure no single pin is overloaded. If you think back to the initial testing of the 12VHPWR connector, which was redesigned with the 12V-2X6 standard due to failure rates, it was shown that the power load was not being distributed evenly across the entire connector. This, in some cases, leading to single pins on the connector melting due to overheating. The Ampinel prevents such an issue occuring. It does so through a few things: firstly, monitoring each of the six power channels; secondly, redistributing the load should any single channel exceed the maximum current that they are r…",

Until now, most advances in these areas have been discovered through trial and error, but a newly developed mathematical model, backed by experimental evidence, could be used to steer engineers in the right direction for the next generation of batteries. That's according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in a report on research carried out by a team of engineers, mathematicians, and material scientists. Specifically, the study investigated the process of lithium-ion intercalation , the electrochemical schenanigans that take place in the batteries we use in watches, phones, and pretty much anything these days. When you charge up the batteries in such devices, lithium ions are driven from an electrolytic solution and jammed into a solid electrode by a voltage source. This process has been intensively studied over the years, and battery designers have typically resorted to using the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation to predict the behaviour of lithium-ion cells. However, the BV formula is…",

Well, maybe now I regret that, because Big Jeff Bezos is taking some time away from making the Washington Post worse to dole out some very good games this October via Prime Gaming . Who says the capitalist class never does anything for you? You can find the full list below, but the big-ticket items here as far as I'm concerned are Fallout: New Vegas (either the best or second-best Fallout game, depending on what day you catch me) and Fallout 3 (slightly worse than Fallout 4; come at me). The former will be available on October 16, the latter on October 23. I suspect the timing here might just be deliberate: the very good Fallout TV show, brought to you by Amazon, is set to hit on December 17 this year, and Lucy and the gang are set to head to New Vegas itself.

As games industry analyst Mat Piscatella said this week , no one really knows, but the speculation we're hearing from analysts and corporate finance experts is that EA's new owners aren't likely to shake things up in the immediate future, and will probably do what you'd expect: focus on its existing live service moneymakers as it pays off that $20 billion in debt. Philip Alberstat, managing director at DBD Investment Bank, doesn't foresee a Toys 'R' Us-style descent into bankruptcy as a result of the new debt on EA's balance sheet. \"EA generates approximately $7.5 billion annually from franchises like Apex Legends, Battlefield, and FIFA [now EA Sports FC],\" said Alberstat. \"That flow of cash gives EA a real capacity to service the $20 billion in debt. The Toys 'R' Us comparison gets thrown around, but in reality that was a dying retailer. EA has sustainable revenue from live services across multiple platforms.\" Beyond it…",

I don't understand why Bandai Namco hasn't shamelessly ripped off the latter with a My Hero Academia game that'd make approximately one billion dollars, but its latest videogame adaptation is at least inching in that direction. At last week's Tokyo Game Show I played about half an hour of My Hero Academia: All's Justice, which is out on Steam next February.

Right? The Halo series began in March of 2022, with a second season following in February 2024 and a third season following never because it was canceled. The show didn't really do all that well critically, as far as I can recall: I don't remember anyone saying they liked it much, though I also didn't hear that it was absolutely terrible. Former Halo art director Marcos Lehto stated that he didn't hate the show, but said it was \" Not the Halo I made .\" The general consensus about the Halo show seemed to be just sort of… eh . But a show being eh is sometimes just the sort of thing I'm in the mood for, and since it's on Netflix, the one subscription I doggedly forget to cancel, it sounds like the perfect thing to stream on a rainy weekend while only half paying attention because I'm also playing Super Video Golf on my Steam Deck.

Then follow me, friend, to Humble Bundle , where they're celebrating Waaaghtober! with a collection of 10 games and a pair of DLCs for just $12. If you're wondering about that odd name, the Waaagh! is the name of the massive military campaigns the orks wage on the galaxy every now and then when they get feeling restless. It is, as the Fandom wiki describes it, \"war on an apocalyptic scale,\" in which \"whole civilisations are exterminated and defenders' armies laid to waste as the Orks plough ever onward in an unstoppable tide.\" The good news is that these things tend to burn themselves out: Once the Waaagh! (the exclamation point is mandatory) has killed literally everything else, the orks will start fighting amongst themselves, as one does. It's a fun rabbit hole to dive down, if you've got a few hours to kill. If, on the other hand, you're really just here for the games, we can do that too. The Waaaghtober! Warhammer Bundle is a mix of genres, so you may not find everything here to your liking: Inquisitor—Martyr, for instance, is an action RPG, while Vermintide 2 is a co-op shooter and Dakka Squadron is kind of an arcade …",

But Mohrta still caught my eye and won't let go. You play as some kind of interdimensional killing machine, an (allegedly) unfeeling assassin in head-to-toe armor that's part Jin-Roh, part Trench Crusade. Their face is covered by a gas mask under a wide-brimmed helmet like a British WWI soldier, but the rest of the ensemble is all plate mail, and they carry an assortment of both medieval and modern weaponry. The demo showed off the sword, a fast-firing pistol, and a classic trench gun-style shotgun, while the trailers have previewed stranger fare like playing cards you throw like shuriken, a pile bunker , or dual flails.

Preloading ensures that players can jump into the game quickly on day one, which is especially beneficial for titles with large downloads.\" Preloading is a practical feature but not very glamorous as these things go; what makes it notable here is that it's been available for years on Steam. Yet Epic, despite being hell-bent on breaking Steam's nigh-monopoly on the PC digital market, hasn't seen fit to add it until now. And it's not as though Epic isn't aware that the absence of preloading, and other such mundane but useful features, is a problem.

Forden's first game credit, for sound, is on the 1989 Midway arcade basketball game Arch Rivals. He's most famous for being the voice (and face) of one of the most random but iconic soundbites in gaming history: yelling \"Toasty!\" when you uppercut someone in Mortal Kombat. \"Wednesday was my last day at Netherrealm. We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff,\" Forden wrote in a farewell post on Instagram . Forden was part of the tiny team that created the original Mortal Kombat in 1992, alongside designers Ed Boon and John Tobias and artist John Vogel. When they set to work on Mortal Kombat 2, Foden was again responsible for the game's sound and music, and credits Boon with suggesting they add an image of him appearing in the corner and saying \"Toasty!\" as an inside joke; the catchphrase started as a taunt when the two of them were working on Midway …",

When the EA buyout was still a rumor, Vincke quipped that \"Someone really wanted to get the rights to Murder on the Zinderneuf,\" referring to one of EA's first games from back in 1983, an 8-bit detective mystery for personal computers of the time like the Apple II and Commodore 64. Probably a good time to remind people that making games faster and cheaper while charging more has never worked before. October 2, 2025 Vincke had a more serious message today , following confirmation of the deal, as well as serial studio-closer Microsoft's announcement of a Game Pass price hike: \"Probably a good time to remind people that making games faster and cheaper while charging more has never worked before.\" Vincke doesn't name names, but this can pretty clearly only be commentary on the biggest stories in gaming right now.

At the time EA was at least gracious towards its former partner, but FIFA wasn't in any mood to play nice. \"I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans,\" thundered FIFA president Gianni Infantino at the time. \"The FIFA name is the only global, original title. FIFA 23, FIFA 24, FIFA 25 and FIFA 26, and so on—the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST.\" As proof that it was taking the breakup well, that year FIFA's tie-in game for the World Cup was some Roblox nonsense featuring… bowling . I always thought the most logical next step for FIFA would be partnering with Konami's eFootball, which remains the most likely competitor to EA Sports FC (even if it's currently in the doldrums). But an actual football game featuring actual 11-a-side matches with actual clubs and players? That's far too straightforward for FIFA, which has now announced its next gam…",

You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year.\" Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI . This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming .

In case you're unfamiliar, Prey is an opt-in PvE system with three difficulty tiers where you'll claim a target, and get targeted in turn—with said enemy being able to ambush you while you're out in the open world and bully you into 1v1 brawls. Eventually, you'll get to hunt them down instead. It's a really elegant way to add difficulty to world content: Entirely optional, keeps you on your toes, and packed with fun gameplay flavour. I got to speak with associate game director Paul Kubit and design director Maria Hamilton about the upcoming feature. \"Prey was a feature that we were talking about pretty early on, while we were building Midnight, as we ideating what could be an exciting way to get people a little bit more engaged in the outdoor world,\" says Kubit. \"Then the team who were working on this really ran with it.

If you're struggling to unlock this quest, make sure that you've made good progress with Elsa and Anna, and you have a relatively high friendship level with them both. You'll also need complete access to the Frosted Heights, but if you've come as far as unlocking Cogsworth then you've probably already got this covered. Once the quest is available and you've hit that friendship milestone, this is what you need to do. How to complete On Her Majesty's Festive Service in Disney Dreamlight Valley Speak to Cogsworth once you've unlocked this quest and he will express that since the Beast doesn't need serving, he's at a loss of what to do with himself.
