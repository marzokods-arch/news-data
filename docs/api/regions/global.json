The toggle would allow emoji to grow right along with the text. Even if we sometimes feel a little burnt out on them, it’s hard to deny the fundamental appeal of emoji . Including just the right one brightens up a dull text, or even helps convey some emotional subtlety that might have otherwise gone missed. But in order to get the most out of emoji, we need to be able to clearly see them, and it looks like Google’s working on a change in Gboard that could soon help out with just that.

Over the years, the unassuming place has drawn a steady stream of musicians, such as songwriting legend John Prine and country singer Hal Ketchum. Gill honors both late music artists in the song, weaving in a tale he heard of Ketchum dancing with one of the bar’s longtime servers. “It’s a true story,” Gill tells Billboard . “Momma — they call her ‘Momma,’ her name’s Daphne — has been there 35 years, maybe more. She’s been serving me cheeseburgers for 35 of the 50 years I’ve been going there. I saw that some of the folks from Edley’s [Bar-B-Que] had brought Brown’s Diner Bar and they told a story about Momma and her favorite memories.

An Experience More with Appreciation Savings plan lowers monthly pricing while also reducing trade-in credits. The Loyalty plan is cheaper for large accounts, but cuts data, perks, and long-term price guarantees. T-Mobile isn’t making a big song and dance about it, but it has started offering two new plans designed to keep existing customers from drifting away . The catch is that neither plan is universally available, and because they aren’t advertised, you may not even know they exist unless you ask. Even then, it isn’t clear if they’ll be revealed. As The Mobile Report reports, citing internal T-Mobile sources, the new plans began rolling out today and are limited to certain “segmented” accounts selected by T-Mobile using undisclosed criteria. In short, it sounds like availability depends on who you are, how long you’ve been with T-Mobile, and maybe even which department you end up talking to.

Besides automatically generated memories, you can also revisit memories by creating collages within the Photos app. But if you use the built-in Collage Editor in Photos, you might find it limiting compared to other third-party apps.

MANGMI is less than a day away from launching the cheapest 7-inch gaming handheld on the market, the Pocket Max , but the deal just became a little sweeter. Today, the company announced that all Super Early Bird orders will also include a free set of microswitch modules. The modular nature of the MANGMI Pocket Max is one of its most unique and confusing features. The device includes a set of soft membrane modules for the D-pad and buttons in the box, with additional clicky microswitch modules sold separately for $15 (previously $12). The modules can’t be moved to, say, put the D-pad above the sticks, but some gamers are very picky about their inputs.",

    "body": "Galaxy S26 Pro render Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR The Exynos-powered Galaxy S26 might feature better on-device AI with native image generation capabilities. Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26.

Tips about upcoming smartphones can turn up anywhere, and as we try to sort through all the rumors and theories surrounding upcoming devices, that can often mean looking at tips that don’t originate in a language we natively speak.

In mid-January, Google announced it collaborated with companies like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair to create a protocol called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) . This protocol would make it easier for AI agents to communicate with retailers for purchases. Along with this protocol, Google also revealed that it would integrate a checkout feature into Gemini, allowing you to make online purchases with the AI.

A separate leak points to an 8.8-inch 3K 165Hz display, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, and a sole 50MP camera. The device is expected to launch in China around March, but we’re yet to see if and when it will come to other global markets. With the proliferation of specialist handhelds and more powerful gaming phones, compact Android gaming tablets don’t come around very often these days. However, Lenovo is determined not to give up on the idea. The company has now officially teased its next-generation Lenovo Legion Y700, offering a closer look at the device’s design ahead of its expected debut this year. The teasers were shared on Weibo (via NotebookCheck ), where Lenovo posted promotional images showing the tablet in both black and white finishes. In the accompanying text, Lenovo refers to the device as the “Lenovo AI Tablet Legion Y700,” with the AI part feeling almost obligatory in 2026.

    "body": "TL;DR YouTube just announced some big access and feature expansions to video auto-dubbing. Auto dubbing is now generally available to creators, and Expressive Speech debuts with support for eight languages. YouTube has also started its pilot program to test lip sync for translations. YouTube attracts creators from all around the world, and while that means there’s almost always going to be some great new content out there that’s targeted at you, it sucks when the video you most want to watch isn’t available in your language. Google’s been working hard for years to break down those kind of barriers, though, most recently introducing automatic dubbing into multiple languages. This week, we’re learning about what sounds like the program’s biggest and most impactful expansion since its creation. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

In the latest Google app v17.4.66 release, we’ve spotted a bunch of new Gemini features under development.

Navigation still works, but the car marker disappears until Maps is force-closed on the phone. Several users say switching back to the default blue arrow icon may stop the issue, at least for now. Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears. Navigation still works, but there’s no visual indicator of the car’s actual location. Force-quitting Maps on the phone brings the icon back for the user, but only until the next time i…",

According to the latest security update listings published on SamsungMobile.com (via SamMobile ), the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra no longer appear on any of the company’s monthly or quarterly update schedules.

There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

The writing is already on the wall with tools like Gemini in Google Workspaces and CoPilot for Microsoft Office.",

The big news is the expected price: about €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is about half of what the original Headphone 1 cost at launch.

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR A Dutch outlet has posted an image showing off the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s S Pen colors. The S Pens might only be available in two main colors, but could have different colored tips to match the S26 Ultra colorway. The outlet also posted images of a few Galaxy S26 series accessories. We’re a few weeks away from the Galaxy S26 line’s expected launch date, and the leaks are continuing to come in. A trusted leaker recently showed off an official-looking S26 Ultra render , and another source has now given us a look at S Pen colors. Dutch outlet Nieuwe Mobiel has posted an image that shows off the Galaxy S26 Ultra S Pen colors, and it turns out Samsung might be going for a different look this time. Check out the image below.",
