The newly released bike patch actually adds bicycles and electric scooters into Skylines 2, along with all the infrastructural gubbins that go along with a bicycle-friendly city. By default, your bike-loving citizens will cycle along the standard road network with cars and trucks. But you can create specific bicycle paths and bicycle road lanes to separate cars from cyclists—which is safer and healthier for everyone. Since cyclists also need a place to park their bikes when they reach their destination, the update also adds numerous types of bike parks. Just as adding more car parks encourages drivers not to park on the street, bike parks will encourage more citizens to cycle around the city rather than drive. But the bike patch adds considerably more, such as several new types of park. This includes a bike park that is also, wait for it, a bike park. What I mean by that is it's a place to park your bike that is also a bike park. Sorry, that still isn't clear enoug…",

Given Firebreak is a cooperative shooter where teamwork is crucial to survival, being able to communicate with friends verbally is kinda important. True, there are plenty of third-party options for voice-chat these days. But sorting that out can be a pain in the arse, especially when you're playing across multiple platforms. Better, if you're making a dedicated cooperative experience, to ensure voice chat is integrated into that. It took five months, but Firebreak has finally done this. In a Steam post Remedy announced that it has added \"cross-platform voice chat\" into all versions, letting you finally gab with your pals in the Oldest House without migrating to Discord. Sadly, it isn't all good news on the Firebreak front. In the same post, Remedy also explained that Firebreak's next major update, Rogue Protocol, has been delayed into 2026. Remedy originally planned to release this alongside voice chat, but explains the mode needs \"a bit more time\" in the oven. This is because Rogue Proto…",

This drive for efficiency is felt across the whole of Black Ops 7, but nowhere more so than the campaign, a grinding slog through the forthcoming Warzone map update and the occasional multiplayer map retooled for wave defense against mindless AI hordes. The premise of the campaign itself is complete nonsense: after being dosed with the Cradle bio-weapon from Black Ops 6, Alex Mason's son has to retread the memories of his father (and, confusingly, his father's squadmates) through shared hallucinations.

If you've watched a single Twitch stream or Marvel movie in the past 15 years, you're probably all too familiar with the concept of a green screen, a bright, single-color surface that makes it easy to blank out a background and fill it in with something else. A Hawaiian beach, a bunch of CGI superheroes punching each other, etc. The more accurate color-agnostic term for the technique is chroma-keying, which is actually how Windows rendered all of its video back in the old days. \"The media player program didn't render the video pixels to the screen,\" longtime Microsoft developer Raymond Chen wrote recently in a blog post . Instead, Windows would render a green screen (or a different color, depending on the version), then \"render the video pixels to a graphics surface shared with the graphics card.\" The fina…",

The search has been going so poorly that I put rusted gears on the backburner while I focused on quests, convinced that pretending I don't care about rust nor gears would magically conjure them in the next dusty toolbox I opened. Then this morning, I saw an X post from Arc Raiders Hub with a ton of views telling of a place where the rusted loot flows like a rushing river: \"THIS PLACE GUARANTEES A RUST PART 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES YOU VISIT!\" the hot tip proclaimed. So I went topside to check it out myself. The spot in the video is the North Elevator of Dam Battlegrounds , a place that I've visited at least a hundred times before, but never picked apart for loot. Right next to the elevator are a handful of buses and cars. According to the tip, the breachable compartments on the back of these buses always contain rusted gears.

The interview starts off with a real bang: When asked what he thinks of \"the problem of predators on Roblox,\" Baszucki replies, \"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well. How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time?\" Yeah, that's sure one way to look at it, and squinting very hard I can sort of see it as a very poorly worded but otherwise okay answer: There is a problem, and by solving it Roblox can lead the way on the development of effective moderation tools for everyone. Okay, fine.

The fact that people are unimpressed that we can have a fluent conversation with a super smart AI that can generate any image/video is mindblowing to me.\" The comment comes as the public reacts to Microsoft pushing its new \"agentic\" services , referring to AI agents that can perform tasks beyond chatting and generating images. Windows head Pavan Davuluri said earlier this month that Microsoft's OS is \"evolving into an agentic OS,\" and I can't say I'm excited about the prospect. Suleyman's inability to comprehend that lack of enthusiasm can easily be resolved with a classic technique from ancient philosophy, or maybe it was an ad for taco shells , in which one accepts two different things at the same time.

If you're not familiar with the game, we called it the best co-op game of 2018 . In his review , PC Gamer writer Steven Messner called it \"gleefully gory\" and said it \"succeeds on the merits of its stellar combat and level design.\" Modeled after Left 4 Dead, the game sees you and a few mates trawl around the ruins of Warhammer Fantasy's apocalypse, cleaving rats into chunks in first-person.

(Image credit: Ludogram) Ok, now that's out of the way, we can break down what that actually means. Basically, in each run you are the custodian of a city on wheels, as it rolls along pursued by ever-escalating hordes of monsters. Your character has auto-firing weapons, like in Vampire Survivors, but so does the city. Instead of adding to your arsenal, level ups allow you to add more buildings, from towers to farmland to factories, all feeding into your defence. If your hero dies, you simply place a grave in your city and spawn a new one—but if your city takes too many hits, it crumbles, and the run is over. So guarding your home as it trundles along is vital… but you're also encouraged to risk breaking away to explore. Out at the edges of the 'road' can be found trees, rocks, and gold ore, all useful in your quest.

The benefit has been a more consistent release schedule. But there are downsides too. The first of these expansions, Secrets of the Obscure, felt like it was trying to pack too much into its limited development schedule—its ambition in terms of story far outstripping what ArenaNet had the time to make. Despite plenty of positives, it ultimately felt rushed and underdeveloped. Last year's Janthir Wilds was more assured, taking valuable lessons from SotO in terms of its scope. It launched with one of the best maps in recent memory (alongside a second that was simply OK), and brought a handful of features that made for a promising first impression. It put its best foot forward, but then ran out of steam. What followed in the subsequent updates was… fine, mostly, but paled in comparison to the expansion's opening salvo, and didn't make the most of the concepts the story was teasing.

Nevertheless, I'd rather not get jumped like that again, and there's actually a rather simple solution I've found for it. Head into the audio settings and enable Night Mode , found just under the audio output option at the top of the list What this does is basically compresses the dynamic range of audio, so loud sounds like gunshots and explosions are quieter and soft sounds like footsteps are louder.

But stand down, folks. Ubisoft's delayed financial report took place earlier today, and it turns out all that hullabaloo was—per company big boss Yves Guillemot—for perhaps the most boring reason imaginable: \"We appointed a new panel of auditors, that was approved at the [Annual General Meeting] last July.\" Oh. In essence, Ubi's new numbers guys decided that revenues from one of its partnerships from the fiscal year before this one needed to be recognised in a different way. The long and short of this process is that the new way of recognising those revenues meant the company suddenly overshot a covenant on how much net debt to core profit it's meant to maintain, and it had to quickly fork over 286 million euros to pay off some ou…",

All of this stacking up before the launch of the first paid DLC, a holiday-themed pack, certainly put a damper on the celebrations. I'm glad to report that the latest Borderlands 4 weekly update has solved a number of these hot-button issues, and Gearbox has even left us a present under the tree. Let's get the biggest news out of the way first—Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is now free for all players and available right now. This holiday DLC was previously announced as a premium, paid pack, but Gearbox explains that it couldn't quite do everything it planned to before it had to release it, so it opted to make it free instead.

As noted last week by PC Gamer's Andy Edser, the Windows team recently stamped out a bug that granted Task Manager immortality . The sadly now mortal Task Manager has also suffering from an indignity for months that I have only just noticed: a crappy, Windows 11-ified icon. I am generally ambivalent about Windows 11's aesthetic. The icons and menus are mostly uninspired but serviceable, blending in with 2020s corporate visual design in a manner befitting an operating system that's iterated itself into a state of near non-identity ( AI will solve that problem, of course !). The desire for, I guess, cohesive branding has hit some Windows icons harder than others. Every Microsoft Office application is now represented by an amorphous blob of color that suggests the vague idea of a thing. It's funny that a decade or so ago we were remarking upon the fact that the go-to save icon, a floppy disk, is a meaningless reference for young people. Now Microsoft has deliberately chosen to turn Outlook's icon into MC Escher's interpretation of an envelope. Take that art history elective if you want to use Office, I guess! (Image …",

But where the previous Spider-Man crossover set was content to wrap deep cuts from the Spider-Verse in existing mechanics, Avatar is more systemically ambitious, giving each flavor of elemental bending its own mechanic. Which is an interesting choice for a set you would expect to be aimed at younger players, but I guess they figured if a 12-year-old can play Magic and make it through the filler episodes where Aang and the gang trudge through a swamp or a town where things are a bit weird then they can sure as hell learn some new rules. Firebending seems like an obvious one. Magic's already got fireballs.

And developer Chief Rebel has the numbers to show it. In a new developer update video , community director Hamish Bode laid out some fun numbers from the game's first month in early access. Even though Fellowship has a long road ahead of it, players have already sunk in a combined 7.2 million hours played. In that time, over 9 million dungeons have been cleared. Bode didn't share the number of dungeons players failed to clear, but he did say that they've died over 49 million times. Ouch. All of that is really just proof that a game where you can run MMO-style dungeons over and over is exactly the kind of thing people have been hoping someone would make. It's not exploding on Steam like Arc Raiders, but it's been quietly hovering around 8,000 concurrent players, which is a pretty healthy amount for something that hasn't been fully released yet.

I've been an energy drink fiend since high school—a fact that I'm neither proud nor ashamed of—but Monster was never a favorite.
