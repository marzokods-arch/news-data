The two sides have agreed to dismiss the case, which centred around, deep breath please, an in-game emote based on the choreographer's viral dance that is performed to Charli XCX's song Apple. The Apple dance, as it became known, was a huge TikTok trend in summer 2024 and has been adopted by Charli XCX herself: Heyer even performed the dance live at one of the star's concerts. It was impossible to avoid at the time, and was subsequently incorporated into a Charli XCX-themed \"Brat\" update for the Roblox game Dress to Impress. The legalities all get a little murky here. Heyer and Roblox were apparently in talks to license the dance in early August last year, but then the update containing the emote was released before any \"signed agreement\", and Heyer subsequently copyrighted the dance. Her lawsuit claimed that Roblox had made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November 2024, and said Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" Well, now she has been, although there's no disclosure of the su…",

At time of writing, more than 500,000 people are playing Silksong on Steam, and the number's increasing every time I refresh the SteamDB chart . In its first 24 hours, Silksong's all-time peak player count is already the 18th highest in Steam history . And it'll likely rank higher before the day's out. As a point of comparison, the original Hollow Knight's Day 1 concurrent player count on Steam peaked at 812 players. In other words, there are roughly 615 times as many people playing Silksong in its first hours than there were playing Hollow Knight at launch. Call me crazy, but I think this one might be a big deal.

Premiering about half an hour before it dropped, as though to keep eager fans company through the last agonising minutes of their wait, Daily Silksong news number 1,693 said goodbye to the cast and crew that have mostly been saying 'no' for the past four plus years, but sometimes yes. After a charming stop-motion vignette in which Ara's friends have to find his bones to turn him back from stone, the host reveals his face for the first time—dressed in a suit to deliver the final bit of news, that Silksong is, in fact, releasing today. \"We finally, finally made it,\" he says, adding that he's been doing this for, in a massive understatement, \"quite a long time. \"Enough time for many things in one's life to change—and a lot of things have changed in my life during that time. I remember watching the original Silksong trailer, right as it dropped, at work on my phone. \"Some three years later,…",

The handheld is demo-ed in a recent video (via NITTRX ), with the creator commenting that playing racing games is \"very exciting.\" And while we're on the subject of peering over from the backseat, the creator has also shared pictures that demonstrate how the handheld is both longer than their rearview mirror and their forearm . This same creator has made a number of charming 'WinMini' handhelds in the past, so it's no surprise that this latest ultrawide effort is similarly Windows-based. The project is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU , the same chip in the MSI Claw A8 and the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds.

If you don't, they'll snowball into an incredible problem. When it comes to the Drifter, this issue's a little more apparent. Bloodscent gives you a literal blood trail and heartbeat sound effect while you're near isolated enemies and, more importantly, a permanent stacking weapon damage buff whenever you kill (or assist in a kill) an enemy hero. In other words, if you've got terrible map sense and are blindly farming the jungle while the Drifter's about, he's going to get a bazillion Bloodscent stacks and run you over. Victor's a little more complicated. His Aura of Suffering builds up damage to enemies and himself, his Jumpstart trades HP for regeneration and movement speed, and his Pain Battery lashes out whenever he takes damage.

The shizzle here involves a couple of new trade mark applications by Valve centred on the term \"Steam Frame\", as spotted on Reddit yesterday .

Of course, applying for a trade mark doesn't guarantee that trade mark gets used. It could even be an intentional distraction designed to draw attention away from some other naming scheme or project.

This week I've been: planning builds for every single skill tree in Borderlands 4, hoping it would help me pick a character, but actually leaving me more conflicted. Most Borderlands fans would say that the game only really gets going once you've finished the campaign and reached the endgame, and I'd agree; that's when you officially start grinding post-campaign activities and gearing up your Vault Hunter. That's not changed in Borderlands 4 . In fact, it's getting a handful of really great changes that'll make it hard to go back to previous games. I'm glad that we're finally able to skip the campaign and jump straight to level 30 on alternate characters, making playing all four characters a much more enjoyable experience. Likewise, I love that gear score doesn't increase with each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode tier, so you don't need to re-farm gear each time you climb up the ranks anymore. Perhaps best of all, the new Wildcard Missions are full of potential. You'll need to complete these capstone challenges to…",

But with how good the MMO apparently is (82% positive on Steam !) it's a wonder you don't hear more about it, right? I'm not the only one who thinks so. In a chat with PCGamesN , Zenimax studio game director Rich Lambert said the low profile of TESO is \"the biggest chip on my shoulder.\" Lambert—who served as TESO's director in a previous life—says the game is \"either not taken seriously or dismissed or whatnot\" and that fact has \"always kind of befuddled me.\" Worse than that, though: Lambert says it's not all that uncommon to run into people who aren't even aware the game is out, 11 years on from release. \"I've been in countless interviews and at countless shows over the years where they're like 'Oh, when does this come out?' It's been out for years!\" Lambert has a theory as to why that happens, though. He reckons it's because the team doesn't \"trumpet\" the game all that much…",

The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal are my blocker of choice, as they're the most effective at reducing outside noise and jet turbine rumble to the bare minimum. So, you might be surprised to hear my rally against noise cancelling headphones for gaming, but let me explain. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is when the headset uses microphones and onboard processing to counteract outside interference. It's quite literally cancelling the noise out with an equal and opposite soundwave. There are multiple types of ANC: feed-forward, which uses a microphone outside the device to pickup external noise; and feed-back, which listens closely to what's happening closer to the listener's ear canal to more accurately counteract what's actually seeping in. The best systems often use a combination of both and adapt how they use each technology for better results. That's what the Beoplay Portal offers, so it's a great example of wha…",

Silksong marketing guy Matthew Griffin confirmed as much earlier today. \"For PC players, screen ratios up to 21:9 are fully supported,\" he posted on X, along with some screenshots to prove it (see them below, but don't get too excited: they're screenshots you've seen before, only wider now). Not content with allaying the fears of ultrawide zealots the world over, Griffin also retweeted an account pointing out that the Silksong soundtrack is much bigger than the original game's, with a total of 53 tracks compared to Hollow Knight's 26 (if you don't count the DLC tracks).

At the start of the video, Bond infiltrates a hotel in much the way Agent 47 from IO Interactive's Hitman games might, spying opportunities for non-violent distraction and deception everywhere he looks: negotiate with a guard, climb a wall, light a pile of leaves on fire, turn on a hose, jump into a flower bed (not the most Bond-like behavior, but it worked). Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: Made yet another Baldur's Gate 3 character despite not having finished the game with any of the six characters he's already made. Once inside, Bond strolls around talking to himself and triggering little in-engine cutscenes, and you get the impression that there's only one way the mission can really go. When the video segues to a car chase, it makes this explicit with the text \"Inevitably…\" on the screen. In the chase, too, it seems clear that Bond is always going to be several car lengths behind his target, regardless of how many shortcuts he takes: He and the femme fatale must arrive at their ta…",

There's a cozy game, a couple puzzlers, and one with lots of combat, if that's what you're looking for.

I'm too young to have had my mind blown by Blizzard 25 years ago, but right now, in 2025, I'm not sure anyone is doing it like GGG. I'm so impressed by the new act that I'll forgive the pacing issues in the rest of the campaign. After all, that's what releasing your game in early access is for, right?

Abyssus adds a special ingredient of its own to the pairing: sea salt. The deep sea diver aesthetic of the FPS roguelike has a slight \"we have BioShock at home\" feel to it for a few minutes, but that dissipates once you're firing a WW1-era repeater or a crackling Tesla gun at towering Aztec-influenced ancient gods who in return assault you with waves and laser beams. Abyssus is a lithe shooter: you've got a dash and a double-jump right from the start, and enemies like divebombing exploding sharks encourage constant dancing around its battle arenas. Bosses bust out \"floor is lava\" moves and expanding rings of crackling damage that at times evoke MMO raid bosses or bullet hell patterns.

How you want to spend your time is up to you. I generally stick to shorter videos if I've already played the game and longer ones if I'm completely new. I've got a recommendation for both types of video and I'll leave it up to you which one you want to check out.

    "body": "Few ideas have as universal an appeal as the space bounty hunter: a character archetype that blends all the best bits of wandering ronin and western gunslingers and gives them a cool spaceship and a jetpack. But while almost everyone wants to be Boba Fett, videogames have given us few chances to live out that fantasy. The closest we've gotten was getting to play his briefly-capitated dad . Around the turn of the 2010s, however, we almost saw our scifi sellsword dreams realized in Prey 2, a sequel to the 2006 FPS that would've placed players in the shoes of a bounty hunter in an alien metropolis—if it wasn't cancelled in 2014 after being mired in development hell, studio acquisitions, and IP juggling routines. While those dreams have been dashed, a new set of supposedly leaked gameplay footage from Prey 2's development has been circulating on Reddit , offering us a chance to sigh wistfully over all the bounties on petty alien criminals we never got to claim. This isn't the first time purported Prey 2 footage has bubbled up through the cracks since 2014, but it's certainly the most substantial. Between the five videos posted by a YouTube account named \"David Hallsted,\" there's more …",

Not because I'm doing the videogame equivalent of 'I could paint that' at an art exhibit, but because whenever I sit down to play one of these games, I wind up glued to my screen for an hour in a self-perfecting trance. Jetrunner is a nifty upcoming speedrunning game, described on its Steam page as \"Trackmania meets Titanfall, that sees Nina White trying to be the very best that no-one ever was at zipping around dangerous construction sites. Also, Matthew Mercer's there and he's doing a somewhat-okay French accent. If the demo's any indication, the full game—which releases tomorrow, September 4, making it one of the few games to not dodge Silksong's release window —will be stocked top-to-bottom with cleverly designed levels, each with some well-placed level geometry to skip half of them with. Nina's basic kit has a wall-run, a walljump, and a dash (which refreshes when you hit a wall). Expanding this toolkit are a handful of in-level powerups, like a massive jump boost that you can execute midair, and every speedrunner's favourite implement: A gun. Most levels have targets you need to shoot to progress, so …",

Acer has been showing off the new portable at the IFA 2025 show despite the fact that the new laptop isn't due to go on sale until early next year. Panther Lake, of course, is Intel's critical new mobile CPU that will debut the once all-important 18A node. Expected to be branded Intel Core Ultra 300 Series, Panther Lake sports Cougar Cove P-cores and Darkmont E-cores, with the mix rumoured to be four P-cores and 12 E-cores. Perhaps more exciting for us, Panther Lake will have Intel's next-gen \"Celestial\" Xe3 graphics tech, with the rumour being a maximum of 12 Xe3 cores. Intel's current Lunar Lake laptop chip has eight Xe2-spec iGPU cores and is pretty competitive with AMD's equivalent Strix Point laptop in gaming terms. So, 12 Xe3 cores should represent a decent gaming upgrade. Panther Lake is also going to bring a big boost in AI performance. Lunar Lake can hit a combined 120 TOPS AI performance from the combined power of its NPU and GPU, but Panther Lake is rumoured to lift that to fully 180 TOPS. That's critical because the big pitch for Panther Lake and the Acer Swif…",

But there's an irony here, isn't there? The Outer Worlds 1 was conceived of in a whole other era, before Obsidian was snapped up by Microsoft (though it did eventually release after the studio was bought). The Outer Worlds 2, in all its anti-The-Man glory, is presented by Microsoft from root to stem. Which is a bit incongruous. You don't get much more megacorp than Microsoft, with its multi-trillion-dollar market cap, brutal layoffs, and clamping down on protests on its own campus. But Obsidian is, at the very least, self-aware about it. \"It'd be ridiculous to say that we don't notice that,\" game director Brandon Adler tells GamesRadar . \"We obviously do. We think it's funny, and we kind of play into it.\" Obsidian promises that its corporate overlord isn't interfering with its message. \"The people we work with really love the game, so no dictates or anything like that,\" noted Leonard Boyarsky, the game's creative director (and OG Fallout dev, by the by). \"You even see it, sometimes, in our trailers and things…",

The more pressing issue was the Portal, the new hub for Destiny 2's seasonal power grind. Still, I figured I'd give it a chance. Maybe it made a poor first impression. Maybe things would pick up once I started earning better gear. This season, I committed myself to the grind; to finding out if I was wrong, if things weren't as bad as I feared. Now that I've achieved power level 400, I can definitively say that, no, it's actually so much worse. It's not just that the power grind feels unrewarding—although it does. This new version of Destiny 2 fails across the board. It fails in ways that would never happen if you were creating a game from the ground up; its issues partly a result of crowbarring the old version of the game into this ill-fitting suit. This was a critical moment for Bungie, and the worst possible time to make such a fundamental misstep. After the layoffs, the uncertainty, and the underwhelming response to Marathon, the studio desperately needed a win. Unfortunately the new version of the game …",
