Thankfully I had the foresight to call a friend for help with assembly, and I would definitely recommend two people to put the Magnus Evo together.

Well, I've got a few theories, and I'd like to dig into them, but before I do: I think the MMO genre is actually in a pretty good place, right now. It's aging, certainly (we'll get into that later) but you certainly aren't spoiled for good offerings. World of Warcraft's got its juice back , and it's adding player housing soon. Final Fantasy 14 looks like it's on a course-correction . Guild Wars 2 and The Elder Scrolls: Online are great exploratory romps. Even those outside the big leagues are merrily trucking along. Hell, you can even play City of Heroes again! Arguably in its best-ever state! What, I say again, gives? Theory 1: Well, Harvey, none of us have any goddamn free time Here's the thing.

Nevertheless, it's a topic that's plagued Battlefield 6 since the very beginning, though its slate of strong military skins at launch was refreshing, to say the least. But with the launch in the rearview mirror now, all eyes are on Battlefield 6 Season 1 to see whether or not that grounded, military feeling is completely thrown to the wayside. After a handful of hours playing Season 1's content early, I can report that the first batch of post-launch cosmetics largely continues to deliver more grounded styles, but those of you who draw the distinction between tactical military gear and more stylised, 'cool' soldier apparel more strictly might see where this could potentially end up.

It's just been updated with a new M5 chip and a bizarre headband, but yep, that's the Vision Pro alright—still looking like an intriguing, but oddly-designed take on how the future of wearable tech should be. Well, Samsung has just launched its Galaxy XR headset , and if I'm not mistaken, I think I can hear the poor old Vision Pro howling from over here. Samsung looks to have used Apple's product as an example of what not to do, as many of the critiques of the Vision Pro seem fixed—on paper, at least. The pricing, for one. At $1,800, the Galaxy XR is still a bit of a teeth-clencher, but it's still nearly half the price of Apple's initial offering. It's also a good-looking device, with an outer screen that doesn't appear to display your bugged-out eyeballs to all and sundry.

According to this blog post on the Microsoft Dev site by Raymond Cheng , pifmgr.dll was added in Windows 95 and is chock full of icons that were created mostly for fun. The idea was that they provided a library of icons \"for people to use for their own homemade shortcut files.\" If Cheng's list is complete, there are a grand total of 38 icons contained in the dll file. The dll also does duty, \"as the name might suggest, to manage PIF files, which are Program Information Files that describe how to set up a virtual MS-DOS session for running a specific application.\" And yet it still clocks in at just 38 kilobytes. Remarkable in an age when your typical minor software update is measured in gigabytes and a multiple-terabyte SSD get filled up in picoseconds. Well, ish.

    "body": "I'm sure we have plenty to actually thank AI for, but DDR4 pricing isn't one of those things. For a long time, DDR4 RAM was cheap enough to be worth consideration if you were looking to build a budget gaming PC. But judging from some recent charts shared by semiconductor analyst Ray Wang , DDR4 pricing is now so expensive it's hardly worth it compared to DDR5, even with DDR5 pricing having increased. There's no source given for these charts, but it tracks with other analysis and even consumer tracking such as on pcpartpicker.com , and Wang is a reliable industry analyst. The AI boom (or bubble) has most certainly played a big part in this, because AI datacentres require tons of DRAM for stacks of high bandwidth memory (HBM). And while DDR5 memory offers the latest and greatest on this front, much of this will be spoken for by big customers, leading many to fall back to DDR4, creating more demand and causing this price rise. This will have combined with declining DDR4 production as DRAM manufacturers transition more heavily towards DDR5, resulting in tons of demand and less supply. Thus, higher prices. We're not just seeing this with RAM, but also with flash storage for SSDs. In fa…",

Luckily, Once Upon a Katamari has come along to remind me of the moreish chaos of these games, and quickly reminded me why I have spent so many hours essentially rolling a virtual ball around. Once Upon a Katamari is the newest mainline addition to the Katamari franchise in 14 years. It's as bright and chaotic as ever, but with a number of new additions to make each of its levels even more engaging. After warming back up to the controls and remembering just how annoyed I get every time I crash into an object I'm not ready to pick up yet, I was fully sucked back into its world.

The new guns are cool—we only had access to those in the first phase, so the SOR-300SC carbine, Mini Scout sniper, and GGH-22 pistol—but the Blackwell Fields and Eastwood maps are, simply put, wonderful. This is, by far, the most intense yet breathable map in Battlefield 6, but what struck me is how instantly iconic it felt. Battlefield 6's maps have been controversial since the very beginning, to say the least. Of its launch offerings, I think Siege of Cairo is fantastic (as is the returning Operation Firestorm), and I'm open to Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak, and even New Sobek City when people aren't abusing the rooftops. But other than Cairo, I wouldn't say any of these arenas are all that memorable or iconic. If you've instead been waiting for more of the large-scale warfare that the series is traditionally known for, then Season 1 will be a salve. Already, we're getting two large maps in Blackwell Fields and Eastwood. Both maps support ground and air vehicles, though only Blackwell Fields features jets. Bla…",

But this is the really exciting bit. Not only will this factory focus on OLED panels for monitors, laptops and tablets, at least at first, but it also uses a novel inkjet manufacturing process to reduce costs. Currently, virtually all PC monitors with OLED screens are based on panels from just two suppliers—LG and Samsung. This duopoly is obviously never going to be a good thing for pricing and competition. So, the insertion of TCL into the fray is most welcome. According to flatpanelshd , TCL will invest over $4 billion into to the new facility, known as T8 and located in Guangzhou, China. The factory will use a so-called 8.6-generation production process, creating huge 2.29 by 2.62 metre OLED substrates, which can then be sliced into smaller screens. TCL currently produces OLED panels on the 5.5G process, mainly for smaller displays that go into laptops, tablets and phones. Aside from the size of the substrate being produced, TCL's new factory is also interesting by virtue of using an inkjet process to \"print\" the panels . LG an…",

Some context: In \"Remix\" events, WoW players can make an alt that's transported to a \"remixed\" version of a certain expansion. While there, they're given a functionally infinite power scaling mechanic courtesy of the Infinite Dragonflight. This kinda breaks the usual holy trinity of tanks, healers, and DPS, however—because if you're able to scale your DPS so high you can melt raid bosses solo, then why wouldn't you just pick the classes with the most in-built damage resistance and defensive cooldowns? As such, the Mythic+ listings for Legion Remix are flooded with shield icons. It's tanks all the way down. Well, Blizzard's trying to address that, per a post sent to the Blizzard forums yesterday. Healers and DPS specs in Legion Remix can now enjoy a 10% increase to their damage, a 33% reduction in damage taken, and a whopping 100% increase to their max HP.

The image quality difference between Performance and Quality can often be dramatic, as it substantially changes the resolution of the game running underneath. The more pixels for the upscaler to work with, the better the graphical quality overall, for the most part. But if you want more performance on less-powerful, yet still-supported hardware? Simply back it down towards a lower setting. Which is why it's pretty astonishing that Ninja Gaiden 4 , the latest entry in the long-running series, has reduced it to a simple enabled/disabled option. As spotted by X user @Sebasti66855537 , a thread on the Steam discussion page highlights the issue—and has received a disappointing response from the developer. New level of game developer incompetence unlocked: pic.twitter.com/cgFWHQBVeE October 21, 2025 \"At this time, DLSS options aren’t adjustable directly from the in-game graphics menu.

I had a good time skulking through the streets of blizzard-battered Seattle, giving it a respectable 78 in my Bloodlines 2 review , but the most common criticisms are the same ones I had.

This is relayed by Igor Wallossek of Igor's Lab who, true to form, has thoroughly tested the power cable and the proposed fix. The problem the customer relayed was that the angled connector that came included with a certain Cooler Master power supply was angled so it was hitting the cooler when attempting to plug it into an Asus RTX 5070 Ti OC. Cooler Master's suggested fix was to adjust the angle of the cable by using \"a small pick or flat screwdriver to release the clips from both sides of the cap.\" If your initial reaction to this suggestion isn't to pull a cartoonish O-face, then maybe you've forgotten about the fact that these 12V-2x6 cables seem to be prone to melting , at least with higher-end graphics cards.

Utilising magnetism like the Hall effect, TMR (tunnelling magnetoresistance) also offers the same longevity and effective banishment of stick drift.

It's called Saints Quarter, and I wouldn't blame you for forgetting (or only now realizing) it exists. Until yesterday, I'd only played on it by accident. Saints Quarter is an anomaly in Battlefield 6's map pool, because it's the only map that's exclusively infantry-only. The most popular modes like Conquest, Rush, and Breakthrough are incompatible with Saints Quarter, so you'll only encounter it in 8v8 playlists like Team Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. (If you also forgot Battlefield 6 had those modes, you're forgiven twice.) I don't fire up Battlefield 6 looking for cramped city streets and small teams—it's all about the big maps, baby—but I have to give Saints Quarter credit. It's not my favorite Battlefield 6 map, but it might be its most successful. In essence, Saints Quarters represents Battlefield Studios' best stab at the Call of Duty experience.

There are seriously a lot of these: in the second half of 2025 alone we've had Heartbeat in Thailand, Such a Guy, Road to Empress, and Love Begins With Goodbye. Most are centred around romance and themed similarly to visual novels: you're a guy, there are a handful of women to talk to, and your choices determine which woman you'll end up hooking up with. Sometimes it's as simple as that: sometimes there's a bit of heart-pumping action involved. At Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week I saw a game called Island of Hearts, which releases early next year and is ostensibly a \"big deal\" as far as these FMV dating sims games go. It's published by 4Divinity for one—a Singapore-based publisher with a growing profile in Asia. Secondly, it stars a gaggle of social media influencers with immense followings in Asia: Siew Pui Yi from Malaysia has over …",

When I'm expected to run and jump sidescroll-ways, my brain responds like a cornered animal. My hands can't be trusted, and nobody is safe—least of all me. Today, that's begun to change thanks to This Is No Cave. It's a minimalist sci-fi platformer, where you play as a charming little yellow-suited astronaut attempting to escape their crash landing on an alien planet by using their boot thrusters and grappling hook to fling their tumbling body through a labyrinth of subterranean tunnels. (Those tunnels, I'm told, are not a cave.) The secret to making 2D movement manageable for me, it turns out, is to take the buttons out of my hands. In This Is No Cave, movement is controlled with mouseclicks: Left click jumps and fires suit thrusters to launch yourself towards my cursor, while right click latches onto grapple points with my grappling hook. That's it. The simplicity of controls, however, doesn't detract from the complexity of the platforming…",

I spent ages searching for the option too, but there is no manual save in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2. The system is a tad barebones and what you see from the beginning is what you get. Unless you're willing to repeat quests completely, the vampire RPG makes you dig Phyre's grave, then lie in it. How do you save in Bloodliness 2? The only way to save in Bloodlines 2 is its auto-save system which keeps your progress through vampire-infested Seattle. When an auto-save is in progress, you'll see an icon in the top right corner of the screen that looks like the Anarch Tags spraypainted around the city.

In fact, of all the hundreds of products we prod, poke, and benchmark throughout the year, gaming laptops make up around 10% of the total we test. So, we know our silicon onions when it comes to mobile machines for making good with the gaming. Each and every gaming laptop that crosses our path gets put through the same rigorous process , where we test gaming and productivity performance with a curated set of benchmarks, and monitor power and thermals, too. And, because we test a ton of them, we can compare each against all the gaming laptops that have gone before. In this list right here are all the highest-rated machines we've scored over 80% so far this year, with links to their full reviews, and all the benchmarking data you could wish for.

    "body": "After less than a month on top, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro has been dethroned as the best high end controller for PC gaming. That's because the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC came out and won the tussle of the controllers. The Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC takes what we like about the standard V3 Pro, adds an 8,000 Hz polling rate, as well as TMR thumbsticks, and comes in at the exact same price. If you play on PC, and have the $200 spare to afford it, the V3 Pro 8K PC is a no-brainer. At 220 g, it's a bit lighter than you might expect (being around 60 g less than the Xbox wireless controller) but that doesn't mean it's not sturdy. Our Alex says this controller is \"solid all over\" and praises the texture grips and great build quality. That's not all Razer's latest has going for it though. It comes with programmable buttons, plus a sequence of back paddles, and the triggers can be adjusted to swap travel distance. If you like a long press from your triggers, flip it one way. If you want to click as quick as possible, flip it the other way. All of these little customization options, paired with Razer Synapse 4, makes this controller super adjustable and the super high polling rate can give y…",

But while the Ace is half the cost, it still sports a very steep price tag for a mere motherboard. So what exactly are you getting for $500 that you don't get with a $250 model? Let's start with the most eye-popping feature, the number of USB ports on the rear IO panel. At first glance, it would seem that you get four Type-C and 11 Type-A sockets for USB devices, but that's only half the story. Like many mainstream and high-end Core Ultra 200S motherboards, the MEG Z890 Ace sports two Thunderbolt 4 ports. These support up to 40 Gbps in Thunderbolt 4 mode, 20 Gbps in USB4 mode, or 10 Gbps when operating as USB 3.2 Type-C sockets, as well as providing DisplayPort 2.1 outputs. The other Type-C connections are 10 Gbps USB 3.2, but here's the really impressive part: So are all the other Type-A ports.

I won't bury the lede here: you can extract in Duckov by returning to the bunker entrance . Being familiar with extraction games actually does you a disservice on this detail because most others boot you out into the map and make you spend several runs trying to find a foothold with gear to get your first true extraction. Duckov is actually a lot more forgiving than that, it just won't tell you so. If you're like me you probably went at least five early runs dead as a duck trying to extract by going through the Northwest Camp without realizing the bunker entrance is also a valid exit point too. There are three extraction points in Escape From Duckov's Ground Zero map . One is obvious, marked on your map. The other two options are returning to the bunker, either by going back the way you came in or finding another secret bunker entrance.

PC Gamer went to Stockholm to chat to the developers at 10 Chambers and get a behind-the-scenes look at what makes Den of Wolves tick. Unlike Payday, which has a much more grounded setting, Den of Wolves wears its sci-fi inspirations on its sleeve. Inspired by movies like Inception, The Matrix, District 9, and Elysium, sticking to sci-fi \"gives the opportunity to play around with stuff and think about what is fun,\" says 10 Chambers COO Svante Vinternatt. Still, \"the freedom we have with this sci-fi space is a bit terrifying,\" admits Anders Svärd, 10 Chambers' master artist. This futuristic shooter has a suitably futuristic locale: the dystopian Midway City, a lawless, corporation-controlled metropolis built in the middle of the Pacific ocean between Japan and the US. Taking visual cues from Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City, with buildings piled on top of each other, as well as Stockholm with its sea-level waterways, Midway is the perfect FPS playground.

Redditor The87Player has built something truly unique, a gaming PC with aged components crammed inside what looks to be a large plastic water jug, with six RGB-emblazoned fans socketed into the front. With one solitary exhaust fan at the rear and no visible ventilation anywhere else, I'd like to note. Luckily, the hardware inside isn't likely to cause too much financial distress if it melts itself into oblivion, as the whole setup is said to have cost €130. That's around $150, for those of you that only speak in God's own currency. Anyway, it's got a decade-old Intel Xeon E5-2673 v3 CPU at its heart, in combination with a luxurious 16 GB of DDR3 RAM (that feels weird to type at this point) and a GTX 960 trucking away in the GPU slot.

According to Caleb in a video posted today , the story increasingly goes that OLED is running out of time and will soon be replaced by RGB mini-LED technology. In part that's thanks to developments like Sony's decision to drop its top rung OLED TV in favour of RGB mini-LED tech and also Samsung's similar micro RGB TV tech . This narrative is likewise driven by the idea that OLED is difficult and expensive to make, which it is, and that consumers are increasingly preferring larger and larger TVs, which they are. That cost problem for OLED is only amplified as panel sizes increase. 85-inch plus OLEDs are crazy money. At the same time, there's the OLED brightness thing, with full-panel brightness remaining a fraction of that achieved by LCD TV with LED backlights. Oh, and the whole burn-in fiasco. Enter RGB mini-LED tech, which is being pitched as the next big thing. Bigger, brighter and plain just better than OLED. And exit OLED, right? As Caleb points …",

It's the best handheld gaming PC in many respects, but not really worth all that money, and while it's lacking in some key features, it's apparently easily upgradeable. This last point has come to light thanks to iFixit's recent disassembly of the handheld. The ROG Xbox Ally X has been given the teardown treatment, and it turns out it's surprisingly easily upgradeable, at least in some ways. This has earned it a 7/10 score from iFixit, which isn't quite the 10/10 it awarded the Framework laptop , but is still pretty impressive, especially for a handheld. It's also upgradeable in ways that should be very relevant to many ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X owners (presumably the same applies to the non-X version, too, even though that wasn't tested). This is particularly true when it comes to storage and thumbsticks. The $1,000 handheld comes with a 1 TB SSD, which is decent for a handheld, but if you're paying gaming PC prices for a handheld, more storage than this would be nice.
