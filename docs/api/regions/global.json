According to X leaker chi11eddog , up front and centre we have the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D2, a 200 W, 16 core, 32 thread beast of a CPU. In really simple terms, it's similar to the the existing Ryzen 9 9950X3D . But as the rather ungainly \"2\" tacked onto the end of the model name implies, it gets another slab of 3D V-Cache added to the second CPU tile, otherwise known in AMD parlance as a CCD or Core Complex Die.

At the time, there were few other models to choose from, but that's considerably changed over the months, and MSI faces stiff competition at this price point. The Z890 Tomahawk's original MSRP was $300, though you're more likely to find it around the $260 mark, and while that's not a huge reduction, it brings it more in line with boards from ASRock and Gigabyte. That's not the only thing that's changed since last year, as the performance of Arrow Lake has noticeably improved due to a wealth of microcode, BIOS, and Windows updates. In gaming, Core Ultra 200S still lag behind AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, though. MSI's Tomahawk series of motherboards has been around since 2018, as part of its budget and mainstream selection of products, sporting the MAG (MSI Arsenal Gaming) moniker. The Z890 Tomahawk WiFi sits near the top-end of the MAG pile, partly because of its price tag, but mostly because of the comprehensive array of features it has.

See, that was the year Telltale reimagined the adventure game as a narrative-driven social conundrum with The Walking Dead. As a point-and-click diehard, I was sceptical of the change in direction. Telltale had been helping to keep adventure games alive after the genre fell out of favour, and now it was making the switch to something that looked like an interactive TV show. (Image credit: AdHoc Studio) In that first episode of The Walking Dead, my scepticism seemed justified, at least by the brain-dead puzzles‚Äîincluding one that involved an otherwise intelligent character not knowing how to use batteries. But I still found myself eager to follow Lee and Clem's grisly journey, wondering if the social friction could make up for what the puzzles lacked. Dispatch is an evolution of the Telltale style.

I definitely recommend checking out for yourself, if that popularity has piqued your interest. As I said in my review, Ball X Pit is \"a roller coaster ride of ball-bouncing action that loves to break its own rules\". It combines Breakout-inspired action with Vampire Survivors-like roguelike progression and even a substantial city-building element between runs, and the result is an absolutely deadly 'one more run' effect.

A simple enough concept, but let's just say this one spiralled a bit. And then some. This incredible desk contains 74 hexagonal frames, 44 of which house 37 active RGB cells. Each multi-layered cell can display its status via perspex inserts and multiple LEDs (via Hackaday ). Between the cells are pathways along which the bees travel, again with RGB lights. All told, there are 3,745 LEDs. It's all controlled by software that Full Stack Woodworking also built. And the resulting bee hive simulation is utterly beguiling. But hold that thought, because this labour of love deserves describing. This is a hugely complex desk build. Just making the top layer of the cell frames from African hard wood was an incredibly involved process, requiring several steps to prepare uniformly thin strips of wood ready to be laser cut. Full Stack Woodworking worked three sessions a day making the top hex frame layer‚Äîbefore work, after work, and before bed. And it took 25 days to ‚Ä¶",

Earlier this year it released its ninth expansion, Grasping Fortune, and now it's gearing up for number 10: Poison Song . This is a big one. Well, they're all big ones, but this is a big one for a new reason . Poison Song means players are finally getting \"one of the holy grails that TR players [have] been waiting for more than twenty years‚Äîthe ability to join House Indoril.\" This is either the most hype-inducing sentence you've ever heard, or completely meaningless (if you are normal), so let me try to break it down.

Though the 8BitDo Retro R8 owes arguably both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses to that commitment. The version I have my hands on is the N edition. Based on an old school Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, to you and me), it's covered in a pale, warm-toned grey colouring, punctuated with a smattering of reds and blacks, plus grey on the base. It's perhaps the most interesting-looking mouse I've tested in years, and the same can be said about the translucent green Xbox edition . The second you pick up this mouse, you will feel every one of its singular design choices. The ends are angular, rather than the grooves we've come to expect from most mice, and the left and right side-buttons are recessed into the frame of the mouse itself. That means you have to get leverage over the opposite side of the mouse to get enough space to jam your finger in. These side buttons ‚Ä¶",

For instance, you might've seen a tip making the rounds about mouse sensitivity: as shared by YouTuber TorbisXD in an X post with over two million views, Battlefield 6 has a few settings on by default that make ADS sensitivity feel weird if you're used to raw input. \"Has your aim been feeling off on PC with mouse & keyboard in Battlefield 6? I have found why. Turn Uniform Infantry Aiming Off, scroll down to find zoom sensitivity smoothing, turn that off. Go back to Uniform Infantry Aiming, turn it back on & put the coefficient at 0!\" I wouldn't say my aim has felt off in Battlefield 6 so far, but I went ahead and tried Torbis' tweaks to see if I noticed any immediate difference. The verdict? Yep, ADS aiming on mouse does feel more precise now, though I'm not sure all the tweaks listed are actually necessary.

And I was right (partially because I'm one of them), but also, it's just a really clever little game. I could talk on and on about how it de-incentivises toxicity, has some really neat boss and class designs, and a progression system that constantly rewards you instead of de-levelling your key and taking your lunch money. And I might. But the thing I'm really impressed by is one tiny little UI feature that solves a problem that's been plaguing World of Warcraft (and other MMOs) for years. Decades, even. See, in MMOs, a secondary responsibility for damage dealers‚Äîother than blasting‚Äîis interrupting enemy spellcasting. Usually, specific abilities need to be interrupted or else the pull of that particular dungeon gets way harder.

The AIO in question looks to be an MSI MPG CoreLiquid P13 360 , and yes, that cooler does actually let you use the screen as an extended display rather than just importing gifs or video files to replay on it. Which means this very likely is Battlefield 6 (BF6) actually playing on the little screen, rather than a streamed video or moving image. It doesn't look like the game's all too playable on the round screen, though‚Äîhalf of the HUD is cut off. Our Jacob Ridley discovered this HUD-chopping effect himself when he tried the cooler's hand at playing Doom in-browser.

Of course, using the same gear as Faker isn't going to suddenly make you too a four-times League of Legends World Champion, but at the very least if you're matching the gaming setups that the professionals use you can't use that as an excuse. You're just going to have to use them to git gud. I've picked out three of the main categories of esports, FPS (Valorant, CS2, Fornite), MOBA (League of Legends, DOTA 2), and sports (Rocket League, FC25), and picked the most popular gaming mouse, gaming keyboard, and gaming headset from what the highest proportion of professional gamers use. It is worth noting that sponsorship and platform plays a big part of this, where Logitech sponsors a lot of the MOBA pros and the PS5 is the de facto platform for something like FC25, so the DualSense is the automatic choice for the pros.

It's ahead of GTA 5 Enhanced, Dune: Awakening, and Football Manager 2020, and just a hair off the personal records of Warframe and Stellar Blade.

Not everyone went to those lengths to advocate for their chosen favourites, but you can be sure every pick is a game that at least a few people on staff care deeply about.

After telling fans (in the form of a random guy on X) that he was still working on translating United Front Games' magnum opus to the silver screen, he's returned to tell us the draft of its script is officially complete. The momentous news came, appropriately enough, alongside a shot of Liu and his own sleepy dog, though the shot of the script itself had the writer's name cunningly edited out. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride for this project, based on‚Äîif you've somehow forgotten‚Äî2012's open world crime game of the year. The film was originally announced back in 2017, with Donnie Yen set to star. Then things went quiet until Yen himself said it had been canned earlier this year. That's when Liu entered to take up the banner. The rights to Sleeping Dogs belong to the game's publisher, Square Enix. You might reasonably think, with Square Enix being kind of weird about its properties in general, that it might bear some responsibility for the movie's rocky road so far. Liu says that's not the case, though. \"[Square Enix is]‚Ä¶",

In the meantime I stayed up trying to find out as much as I possibly could about the characters and setting. When Little Nightmares 2 launched it took me a single day to get through. You literally couldn't have peeled me away from it if you tried. So, when the third game was announced in 2023, the excitement started all over again. Little Nightmares 3 is the first game of the series to be developed by Supermassive Games rather than Tarsier Studios. Despite this change, it certainly looks the exact same as the other two games. When you begin the adventure, you awaken in a strange environment overwhelmed by a feeling of dread, and everything around you looks gigantic to really emphasise how small you are as a child. The same goes for the various humanlike creatures you encounter, alongside the main villains, all of which tower over you. In previous games, one of the things that made the villains so scary w‚Ä¶",

Everywhere was hugely ambitious and backed by the staggering sums that Benzies' reputation could attract: Barb had raised ¬£233 million by 2024, and by the end of that year boasted 448 staff. But it didn't have a game it could release and, with Everywhere's ambitious scope, a decision was made at some point to shift focus to MindsEye, which had begun as an in-game experience that was part of Everywhere. MindsEye released in June this year and has been a disaster. Within weeks of the game's launch there was news of mass layoffs at Barb, the true scale of which is only now becoming clear.

Though it's not on sale right now, I've seen it discounted at both Amazon and Best Buy multiple times over the last few months. At this price point, I can't recommend a single 4K webcam on the market over this one, assuming you'll actually get the use out of 4K. 4K is still a bit of a niche even now. Some software doesn't support it, and others (like Discord) require you to have access to a subscription for 4K webcam streaming. Even if your software supports 4K resolution, a small cam on top of a stream on Twitch or YouTube generally won't justify such a high resolution. When some 4K webcams cost upwards of $200, that extra cash never feels worth it for my use cases. However, down to $100, it makes a lot more sense, and isn't too far from the prices of standard 1080p webcams. With its look and price point, the Insta360 Link 2C is a natural competitor to the Obsbot Meet 2 , which is still the cutest webcam I've ever used, almost a year after first using ‚Ä¶",

The found camera, a SubC Rayfin Mk2 Benthic, was discovered with a shattered lens but an intact casing; while the memory card inside was also intact, the data appeared to be encrypted or otherwise inaccessible, as Manley explained in the above thread. Working with the Canadian Transportation Safety Board and camera manufacturer SubC, the investigators in the pictured report were able to recover nine videos and 12 images.
