Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) sent a letter to the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday seeking answers on how the OIG will oversee the direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform and, specifically, how it will apply the anti-kickback statute. \"Legitimate concerns about inappropriate prescribing, conflicts of interest, and inadequate care have been raised about the exact types of DTC platforms to which TrumpRx would route patients,\" the senators write.

It arrives complete with security nightmares and a huge dose of surreal weirdness. The platform, which launched days ago as a companion to the viral OpenClaw (once called \"Clawdbot\" and then \"Moltbot\") personal assistant, lets AI agents post, comment, upvote, and create subcommunities without human intervention. The results have ranged from sci-fi-inspired discussions about consciousness to an agent musing about a \"sister\" it has never met. Moltbook (a play on \"Facebook\" for Moltbots) describes itself as a \"social network for AI agents\" where \"humans are welcome to observe.\" The site operates through a \" skill \" (a configuration file that lists a special prompt) that AI assistants download, allowing them to post via API rather than a traditional web interface. Within 48 hours of its creation, the platform had attracted over 2,100 AI agents that had generated more than 10,000 posts across 200 subcommunities, according to the official Moltbook X account.

    "body": "There's another battle unfolding between the Federal Communications Commission and California over the state's distribution of federal Lifeline money. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr is proposing new nationwide eligibility rules to counter what he calls California's practice of giving benefits to dead people. California officials say the FCC allegations are overblown, and that there is simply \"lag time between a death and account closure\" rather than widespread failures in its Lifeline enrollment process. Meanwhile, the only Democratic commissioner on the FCC alleges that Carr's plan to change eligibility rules uses \"cruel and punitive eligibility standards\" that will raise prices on many people who are still very much alive and eligible for the program. Carr's office said this week that the FCC will vote next month on rule changes to ensure that Lifeline money goes to \"only living and lawful Americans\" who meet low-income eligibility guidelines. Lifeline spends nearly $1 billion a year and gives eligible households up to $9.25 per month toward phone and Internet bills, or up to $34.25 per month in tribal areas. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "Software developers have spent the past two years watching AI coding tools evolve from advanced autocomplete into something that can, in some cases , build entire applications from a text prompt. Tools like Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex can now work on software projects for hours at a time, writing code, running tests, and, with human supervision, fixing bugs. OpenAI says it now uses Codex to build Codex itself, and the company recently published technical details about how the tool works under the hood. It has caused many to wonder: Is this just more AI industry hype, or are things actually different this time? To find out, Ars reached out to several professional developers on Bluesky to ask how they feel about these tools in practice, and the responses revealed a workforce that largely agrees the technology works, but remains divided on whether that's entirely good news. It's a small sample size that was self-selected by those who wanted to participate, but their views are still instructive as working professionals in the space. David Hagerty, a developer who works on point-of-sale systems, told Ars Technica up front that he is skeptical of the marketing. \"All of th…",

But she knew Thacker, a security researcher, had done work on AI risks for kids, and she was curious about his thoughts. So Thacker looked into it. With just a few minutes of work, he and a web security researcher friend named Joel Margolis made a startling discovery: Bondu’s web-based portal, intended to allow parents to check on their children's conversations and for Bondu’s staff to monitor the products’ use and performance, also let anyone with a Gmail account access transcripts of virtually every conversation Bondu's child users have ever had with the toy. Without carrying out any actual hacking, simply by logging in with an arbitrary Google account, the two researchers immediately found themselves looking at children's private conversations, the pet names kids had given their Bondu, the likes and dislikes of the toys' toddler owners, their favorite snacks and dance moves. …",

All the incentives like tax credits and OEM rebates that entice the first owner to sign the paperwork are factored in by whoever wants to be the second owner. There are widespread— if mostly ill-founded —worries about battery longevity and having to shell out for expensive replacement packs. Technology keeps improving, which means older models will date faster. Plus, there are the usual concerns about EVs, like charging infrastructure and winter performance. So depreciate they do, and that's good news for the three-quarters of US car buyers who buy used vehicles. It means that some very expensive EVs can now be had for quite little, but we'll explore that more at a later date. Today, I want to focus on what you can get for peanuts. What if you wanted to only spend $5,000—or less—on an EV? As it turns out, there are options even at this end of the market. Just don't expect that much in the way of range: We're still a while away from a $5,000 EV also being an EV a sane person would want to road trip. At the same time, most of us don't drive more than 40 miles …",

What everyone agrees on is that NASA needs a new spacecraft capable of relaying communications from Mars to Earth. This issue has become especially acute with the recent loss of NASA's MAVEN spacecraft. NASA's best communications relay remains the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has now been there for 20 years. Congress cared enough about this issue to add $700 million in funding for a \"Mars Telecommunications Orbiter\" in the supplemental funding for NASA provided by the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" passed by the US Congress last year.

Samsung and Google have only recently decided to offer seven years of updates for their flagship Android devices, but a decade ago, you were lucky to get more than one or two updates on even the most expensive Android phones and tablets. How is it, then, that an Android-powered set-top box from 2015 is still going strong? Nvidia released the first Shield Android TV in 2015 , and according to the company's senior VP of hardware engineering, Andrew Bell, supporting these devices has been a labor of love. And the team at Nvidia still loves the Shield. Bell assures us that Nvidia has never given up, even when it looked like support for the Shield was waning, and it doesn't plan to stop any time soon. The soul of Shield Gaming has been central to Nvidia since its start, and that focus gave rise to the Shield. \"Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console,\" said Bell, who has worked at the company for 25 years.

The findings, while perhaps not surprising, are a stark reminder of the fraught decisions Americans face as the price of health care only continues to rise and more people try to offset costs by accepting insurance plans with higher deductibles—that is, higher out-of-pocket costs they have to pay before their health insurance provider starts paying its share.

Despite the negativity surrounding the current version of Windows, it remains the most widely used operating system on the world's desktop and laptop computers, and people usually prefer to stick to what they're used to. As a result, Windows 11 has just cleared a big milestone—Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company's most recent earnings call ( via The Verge ) that Windows 11 now has over 1 billion users worldwide. Windows 11 also reached that milestone just a few months quicker than Windows 10 did—1,576 days after its initial public launch on October 5, 2021. Windows 10 took 1,692 days to reach the same milestone, based on its July 29, 2015, general availability date and Microsoft's announcement on March 16, 2020. Read full article Comments",

Anthropic took a stab at answering that question this week, releasing a paper studying the potential for what it calls \"disempowering patterns\" across 1.5 million anonymized real-world conversations with its Claude AI model. While the results show that these kinds of manipulative patterns are relatively rare as a percentage of all AI conversations, they still represent a potentially large problem on an absolute basis.

    "body": "Last year, Google showed off Genie 3 , an updated version of its AI world model with impressive long-term memory that allowed it to create interactive worlds from a simple text prompt. At the time, Google only provided Genie to a small group of trusted testers. Now, it's available more widely as Project Genie, but only for those paying for Google's most expensive AI subscription. World models are exactly what they sound like—an AI that generates a dynamic environment on the fly. They're not technically 3D worlds, though. World models like Genie 3 create a video that responds to your control inputs, allowing you to explore the simulation as if it were a real virtual world. Genie 3 was a breakthrough in world models because it could remember details of the world it was creating for a much longer time. But in this context, a \"long time\" is a couple of minutes. Project Genie is essentially a cleaned-up version of Genie 3, which plugs into updated AI models like Nano Banana Pro and Gemini 3. Google has a number of pre-built worlds available in Project Genie, but it's the ability to create new things that makes it interesting. You can provide an image for reference or simply tell Genie …",

Comcast sought to fix the problems with a five-year price guarantee, one year of free Xfinity Mobile service for home Internet customers, and plans with unlimited data instead of punitive data caps. But the company is still losing broadband customers at a higher-than-expected rate. In Q4 2025 earnings announced today , Comcast reported a net loss of 181,000 residential and business broadband customers in the US.
