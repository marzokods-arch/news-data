See, present-day Minecraft has a few core principles. The relevant ones to everyone's least favourite critter are \"be fair to players\", \"bad things can happen, but they're technically the player's fault\", \"find the right level of destruction\", and \"don't add features that wreck player's builds.\" If you're sitting here thinking 'hey, wait a second, those are all things that the Creeper does!' then you'd be right. As Chief Creative Officer Jens Bergensten says in the video linked above, \"If you followed the rules we have today, you would probably not add the creeper, because it would actually be so controversial to have a monster that would show up and just destroy what you built.\" However, the \"creeper is very iconic\", which seems in direct conflict with all those lovely pre-established rules.

But there's a good-news twist. The slop seems to have plateaued. Research outfit Five Percent has published a new white paper analysing online content published between January 2020 and May 2025. The results indicate that material created with machine learning tools initially overtook human-written content late last year. However, the data also shows the proportion of AI-generated material plateauing. In fact, the rapid growth of AI content actually begins to slow in the data around mid-2023. Two immediate questions spring from this. First, why is AI content plateauing? Second, how accurate is this study likely to be? Five Percent addresses both of these queries. \"While AI-generated articles grew dramatically after ChatGPT launched, we do not see that trend continuing. Instead, the proportion of AI-generated articles has remained relatively stable over the last 12 months.

It can feel like running through treacle trying to rank up, level weapons for attachments, and perhaps most painful of all, to complete the many arduous assignments—not helped by a prominent bug causing assignments not to track . Whether through fear of players unlocking everything right away and getting bored, or in an effort to curtail those who would inevitably use Portal as an XP farm , it's not working out well for anyone. Portal servers totally aren't inundated with private bot matches to cheese progression to the point that this creative mode isn't actually serving its purpose. Or at least, that's what I'd say if I were lying.

We already had an idea of what, and more specifically who, would be coming as part of this update thanks to a teaser shared earlier in the year, but it's nice to finally see the characters in-game. The Winter Ball will bring Cinderella to the game, one of the characters players have been desperate to invite to their valley since it launched. Even though the roster gets bigger every single year, there's still a pretty significant lack of original princesses, so having updates like this one is always exciting, even though we've still got a couple of months to wait before we get to meet her. The showcase also gave some info on who else will show up as we unlock Cinderella.

Battlefield 6 's devs have re-affirmed my decision to not get into coding with its latest bug. As spotted by Eurogamer , BF6 players have been suffering a weapon glitch that makes it harder for them to aim—see, in most FPS games, the longer you hold down the trigger, the worse your aim gets. This is called 'spread' or 'bloom', and it's usually accounted for by not shooting for a little bit, giving your poor virtual soldier's tired arms a li'l break. The Gunplay in Battlefield 6 feels rough sometimes because it is still not working correctly. Spread/bloom is not resetting correctly. #Battlefield6 - Example: pic.twitter.com/ymILTAzh6v October 14, 2025 Except, in Battlefield 6, it'll sometimes just not reset at all—as shown in the clip above .

Of course, we haven't seen any characters, but the three images shown on the roadmap give away who we can anticipate arriving. Though, it wouldn't be unusual for Dreamlight Valley to throw in some curveballs either. It currently seems like \"early 2026\" will bring Lady and the Tramp, as suggested by a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs in a Parisian street. Then, it looks like Pocahontas will be joining us in spring, as symbolised by a raccoon sat next to her necklace and a gust of orange leaves. Finally, a statue of Phil in a biome that looks a lot like Mythopia, alongside Hercules' sandals suggests that Hercules may be coming in Summer. This is as much as the roadmap reveals, and whoever is arriving in winter is yet to be announced. I can't imagine we'll see any sort of teaser until we are well into next year. (Image credit: Gameloft) I'm excited to see more 'classic' Disney characters coming in 2026 if these predictions are right. As much as I loved the addition of Joy …",

Stop giggling at the back, I know where you were going. Anyway, the myAir.0 OriMouse came to my attention this morning (via PC Watch ). It's a clever foldable mouse that can be squashed flat to a mere 5 mm thick—but every time I look at the photos and think about holding one, something uncomfortable happens to the back of my neck. I think it's got something to do with the texture of the materials (two different forms of vegan leather, apparently) in combination with the angle of the \"hump\" that would rest in the centre of your palm, which looks to be almost a corner. An inevitable result of the foldable design, I assume, but it gives me a proper case of the heebie-jeebies when I think about placing my hand on one. Which, let's face it, is probably a me thing. Otherwise, I think it looks like a pretty neat technical achievement. The sensor …",

These are facts. Another fact is that, luckily, it's quite easy to upgrade from monitor speakers, which are only getting smaller and therefore worse as displays (and indeed laptops, which suffer from the same audio blight) get thinner to actual PC speakers . This soundbar from Creative, the Sound Blaster GS3 , isn't exactly huge either, and doesn't cost a lot of money. It's an entry-level audio solution for desktop PC gaming, and while it's always going to be better than using the speakers built into your screen—or indeed having no speakers at all—let me be clear, you shouldn't expect miracles.

We're still waiting for a new Splinter Cell game and it's been more than a decade since the last one, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, which was released way back in 2013. And even though Ubisoft has confirmed that it's working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell, we haven't heard hardly anything about it in several years. I even took the opportunity to ask Splinter Cell: Blacklist director Guillaume Dousse if he could shed some light on the next Splinter Cell game when we chatted last week, but he regretfully said he didn't have \"the security clearance\" to get us any new info. Ah well, I tried. Dousse, a longtime fan of the Splinter Cell games, will serve as supervising producer on Splinter Cell: Deathwatch Season 2, as well as direct its first episode, according to an email sent to PC Gamer.

I spawned on top of a small castle and picked up some sticks and planks that were lying around, which told me there was crafting. I descended a level and battled some skeletons, so hey, there's monsters. I quickly found a forge, so there's smithing, and a cauldron, so there's cooking. Within a couple minutes I had a magic sword that did poison damage, some armor (wooden, but better than nothing), a shield I'd crafted myself, a couple of potions, a bowl of mushroom stew, and a key to unlock a chest full of loot. That's a promising start. And outside the castle I found my first little airship, so there's flying, too. Explore a world dotted with islands (both in the ocean and hovering high above it), battle monsters, gain skills, craft weapons and armor, and build a mobile base on a flying ship?

Lmao. pic.twitter.com/A0k1I32mRd October 15, 2025 In the last 24 hours, clips have started circulating of players able to gain unparalleled verticality with a kind of bug that makes you wonder, \"What was the person who discovered this even doing?\" Typically, standing on a drone in BF6 doesn't achieve much: As soon as its controller moves it, you'll slide off. But as this clip from Charlie Intel demonstrates on X, standing on a stationary recon drone and clonking it with a sledgehammer causes an almost-definitely-unintended physics interaction that launches the drone and its surfer directly upwards. Because the motion isn't coming from the drone pilot's inputs, the rider is able to keep their footing. The drone will start drifting downwards after ascending, but in a delightful rejection of our earthly physics, the bug's repeatab…",

Today I'm going to put your brains and fingers to the test with our biggest quiz yet, and this one is all about game genres. According to the list I've pulled from Steamworks and SteamDB, there are over 130 different game genres and sub-genres that have their own tags on Steam.

They're in alphabetical order, which may help, and you can click the hint button if you want some clues. The concept of a genre, and Steam tags in general, can be a bit nebulous, and there are gonna be certain tags you might expect that aren't on the list, like \"VR\" or \"Cozy\" or \"Adult\"—which all sorta feel like they should be genres but are maybe more descriptors.

The Invasion game mode basically takes these encounters and intensifies them, putting real players into each trial rather than NPCs.

Specs-wise, other than the simple fact that the new GPU, codenamed Crescent Island, is using that next-gen Xe3P technology, there's little to go on. The only other detail is 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory. Actually, that's a relatively revealing spec as it implies this GPU will be a value play, at least in the context of megabucks AI chips.

Notably, there's no mention at all of Celestial, the graphics architecture that was supposed to follow Intel's current Battlemage tech , which was previously presented under the Xe3 brand and was equally absent from the Panther Lake launch , despite that chip getting Xe3 graphics.

Hell, it even runs like a dream . That's not to say the game's entirely without issues, of course, and one persistent grumble since launch has been about Conquest mode, which is arguably the series' 'main' mode and one you'll likely be spending a lot of time in. The problem is time itself: Conquest is a mode designed around each team having a set number of 'reinforcement tickets', which tick down as the match progresses—the first team to run out of tickets loses. Battlefield 6 added a timer to Conquest, something that wasn't present in previous Battlefield games, and so players have run into a repeated issue where matches are finishing before either team has run out of tickets.

Forgive the Destiny jargon, because this thing loves an in-game currency, but unstable cores are how you infuse gear, increasing its power level beyond the seasonal cap. The problem with the currency was relatively simple though, to the extent you wonder how it ever released in this state: it cost huge amounts of cores to do more or less anything at higher levels, compared to the small amount you'd earn for dismantling loot. Anyone still playing Destiny 2, it's fair to say, is probably also running multiple builds, and so the problems with unstable cores quickly became exponential: the higher level infusions could add up to tens of thousands of cores. Bungie is now taking the opportunity, with the release of Destiny 2: Renegades on December 2, to correct its mistake. Having previously said it intended to \"rebalance the economy\" of unstable cores, it's now just admitting this was a bad idea all along. \"We have landed on a plan to fully deprecate this currency,\" says Bungie . \"Once deprecated, infusion…",

And apparently \"this situation is not unique to Framework.\" That's according to the security company , which notes that UEFI shells that enable these vulnerabilities aren't backdoors placed by bad actors for malicious purposes (via Bleeping Computer ). \"Instead, they’re legitimate diagnostic tools signed with trusted certificates that contain functionality to effectively bypass security controls we’ve built into the boot process\" the company says. \"The implications? Systems that have a secure boot process, in reality, do not.\" A UEFI shell is a command-line environment that loads before the operating system boots up.

But there's been talk (and specifically images) of MSI RTX 5090 graphics cards ending up in China, so MSI has just clarified that \"MSI has never officially sold or distributed the GeForce RTX 5090 in China.\" Amidst back-and-forth tariffs and restrictions in the US-China trade war over the last few months, there have been reports of big smuggling operations running restricted AI chips into China. For instance, earlier in the year a Financial Times investigation suggested at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs were shipped to China during strict export controls, and there have even been arrests in a different case regarding exports of \"tens of millions of dollars’ worth of sensitive microchips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications\" over the last three years.

ADATA's Chen Libai has said that supplies of all the major memory and storage technologies—DRAM, NAND, and HDD—are now in shortage. Chen says it's the first time that has happened in 30 years. The reason is clear enough: demand from AI. \"Our competitors in the fight for supply are no longer our peers, but giant CSPs (cloud service providers),\" Chen said. By way of example, OpenAI alone (yeah, it's always OpenAI) has signed a deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which is equivalent to 40% of current global DRAM output . Moreover, the AI-driven surge in demand is prompting manufacturers to prioritise production capacity for high-margin applications. Sound familiar? It's all rather too reminiscent of the GPU market for comfort, and we know what happened to graphics card prices in the last few years. Ouch.

But now, having played its (albeit too brief) demo, I am thrilled that it feels like it'll live up to my expectations. You play as Pon, a tanuki responsible for delivering mail across four bright, summery Japanese towns. As summer starts coming to a close though, the Tanuki Festival gets closer, and the shrine has been left in disrepair. With the pocket money you earn from your part-time job at the post office, alongside the minigames you can complete around the town, you can purchase decorations to make the shrine as magical as it should be before the festival. When you start the demo, your first task is stacking packages and letters into your bag which you then need to deliver.

The third in the Medal of Honor series, it had been farmed out to a new developer called 2015, Inc. Publisher Electronic Arts decided not to keep 2015 on for the inevitable follow-up, however, bringing the series in-house. Which left 2015 at a loose end. Having been given a tight deadline to crank out a franchise entry and then absolutely smashing it, the studio assumed it would be allowed a second chance. When EA decided not to keep them around, a chunk of 2015 including Allied Assault's development director Vince Zampella went to EA's rival Activision, started a new studio called Infinity Ward, and invented Call of Duty. If EA had kept them around, 2015 would presumably have happily kept making Medal of Honor games for them and Call of Duty wouldn't have become a thing.
