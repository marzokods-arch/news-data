It's set in an isometric city covered in rust and filth, is intensely detailed with surreal art, and sticks all its dialogue on the right side of the screen. However, the Disco Elysium comparisons don't seem to apply to protagonist Hershel Wilk, who appears to be a relapsed spy called back in to assemble a squad. I don't think that you'll be waking up hungover and naked in your hotel room at the start of Zero Parades. Hershel, the two off-screen characters in the State of Play trailer explain, hasn't been around for five years, but is still considered one of the best. That doesn't mean she won't get into trouble. There's a scene where she's being interrogated while strapped to a chair and getting up to some hijinks around the city wearing a rectangular mascot's jiggly head. I can only imagine it's to pass a tough skill check. There are a few glimpses of familiar systems from Disco Elysium, like a black and white detective vision for piecing together bits of evidence and a menu screen of ongoing tasks in the form of playing cards.

I realize Logan has razor-sharp claws that snikt out of his hands, and his whole deal is using them to cut people up into multiple pieces. I also know a couple of the Marvel movies have gone deep into R-rated territory and shown him popping his claws through people's domes. I somehow just wasn't expecting the game to be quite as graphic as it is. Like, so many people are stabbed right in the head in the trailer. Not just in the head, but in the face . I read X-Men comics as a kid for probably 10 years, and Wolverine killed plenty of people in them, and I even remember a miniseries of comics where he definitely put his claws directly through a dude's face. But I feel like that was somewhat of a rare occurrence. He'd slash people up, sure, but it was rarely all that bloody on the page. I'm not complaining, I'm just a little taken aback, possibly because Insomniac's Spider-Man games are pretty PG, right?

There's no mention of a PC version in the trailer, and the official website, deusexremastered.com , currently doesn't work, but a representative for the game has separately confirmed to PC Gamer that Deus Ex Remastered will get a PC version, too. I'm thinking it may be a bigger deal to the console crowd anyway, though. Deus Ex is a PC classic through and through, and as such, fans have kept the original fresh themselves with mods. GOG will supply you with fan overhaul Deus Ex: Revision , for instance, and what we see in this trailer doesn't necessarily look better to me. The official remaster will feature \"new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,\" according to a post from Aspyr on the PlayStation Blog . They've also rebuilt the character models, added lip-syncing to the dialogue, and thrown ragdolls into the mix. (Well, I'll basically never say no to ragdolls, so maybe I'm back on board.)

The headlining addition in TU3 is Omega Planetes, the FF14 incarnation of Final Fantasy's recurring mechanical superboss who's somehow managed to hop dimensions into the Monster Hunter setting. Considering Omega is a superweapon whose prime directive is dragon killing, its presence presumably doesn't bode well for Monster Hunter's largely lizard-based ecology, so it's up to the hunters to boot it back to its proper reality.

And given Qualcomm is part of this particular conversation, that device would presumably be running an Arm chip rather than a traditional x86 PC processor. The venue for all this is Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 , where Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon had an on-stage conversation with Google SVP of Platforms & Devices Rick Osterloh. Google said last year that it planned to base ChromeOS on Android in future, as opposed to being its own stand-alone OS. At the summit, the pair fleshed out some of the details. \"In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,\" Osterloh said. That has meant, for instance, that running Android apps on a ChromeOS device required a virtual machine. But ChromeOS will now be a part of the overall Android stack. \"We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems. \"This is …",

In a recent post to the Helldivers 2 Discord, community manager Baskinator relays: \"We know many of you have been experiencing issues, including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs. \"We’ve seen the feedback across Discord, forums, Reddit and our dashboards. You’ve been loud, clear, and absolutely right to expect better. We also recognise that our recent updates haven’t hit the mark, and our silence hasn’t helped. That’s on us. We read all of it, and we are hard at work creating a roadmap to address this.\" The developer then states there'll be a mid-October patch that should address some of the woes, including landing on caves, crash fix…",

In Persian, this is called 'taarof' and can take the form of multiple polite refusals in response to, say, a host's offer of food. A good host will continue to insist and a good guest will refuse two to three times before pretending to cave and only then filling their plate.

I did like aspects of Hades 2 when it launched in early access. Protagonist Melinoë's magical array of attacks were more immediately satisfying than Zagreus' at the start, and the new cast of characters, like Hecate and Nemesis, gave it a sharper, darker tone.

The most complex direct-die, liquid cooling loops you'll see in a gaming PC all involve using a chamber that mounts on top of the CPU. At no point does the coolant ever touch the chip directly. In a recently published blog, Microsoft explains how it has developed a system that does precisely that. By etching the surface of the processor die with an intricate pattern of tiny channels, water can then be pumped directly into the silicon itself, albeit to a very shallow depth. The keyword to describe this is microfluidics , a technology that's been around for many decades, and if the history of consumer tech is anything to go by, it'll be a phrase plastered across every CPU cooler within a couple of years (though not actually do anything).

    "body": "Last week brought a new update to Counter-Strike 2 that, among various tweaks to the game, added a brand-new way to obtain the game's latest set of gun skins. The set is called the Genesis Collection, though sadly Valve neglected the chance to name them all after Phil Collins songs, and can only be bought through an item called the Genesis Uplink Terminal: which is kind of a case, but not as we know it. A quick primer before we get into the functionality. Both CS:GO and CS2 award their players weapon skins or cases for hitting various in-game milestones. The way they've been awarded has changed over time, and the game's added additional cosmetics like graffiti, but these gun skins are the bedrock of a vast marketplace, the true size of which is unknown. And yeah: the ones you get just for playing can look nice, but generally hold little value, while the finishes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars are almost exclusively found in weapon crates (unlocked with a case key that costs $2.50). Weapon crates are pure RNG, and have their share of critics: some would say that the upfront cost and unknown outcome make them gambling. The new Genesis Uplink Terminal seems like a respon…",

I just wrapped up my 60-hour playthrough of all three acts, and I did not walk out of Pharloom with the same thumbs I started my journey with. I did almost all the mementos (I didn't bother with the Hunting Journal; I'm here to hit stuff, not collect things), got all the fleas , and alt+F4'd out of petty spite while trying to beat Seth's score in Flea Dodge. Managed it later, though. Shudder. Never again. Nice. (Image credit: Team Cherry) Silksong isn't just hard, though. It's actively mean-spirited at times. I've managed to write not one , not two , but three bench-based PSAs about hidden resting spots in terrible areas. At times, the game actively goes \"ner-ner\" and gives you a wedgie for daring to play; It hits you over the head with an Acme frying pan; It paints a tunnel on the side of the cliff, watches you splat into it, and then nicks your wallet while you're twitching on the ground.

Oh, and the devs are putting out pretty much a whole bonus game alongside it: Yakuza 3 Gaiden: Dark Ties, where you play as Yakuza 3 bad guy Yoshitaka Mine. Go big or go home is, I guess, the RGG motto. Kiwami 3 is a full-on remake in the Yakuza 6 Dragon Engine, much like Kiwami 2 was, and once again follows world's-worst-criminal-but-best-dad Kazuma Kiryu as he tries to literally stop evil men from tearing down his orphanage. You know, like how criminals do. With the Yakuza/Like A Dragon games now firmly established in the west, Kiwami 3 will also feature an English voice dub alongside the expected Japanese.

And if the naming of some software configuration code is anything to go by, Intel might even have something planned to put its frame gen tech on par with Nvidia's.

And the GTA vehicle handling. There's even a little Watch Dogs-y drone tossed in there, too. Honestly? I'm here for it. Especially from a press release that claims each character's going to have \"a basic movement skill such as parkour, swinging, or wall-…",

    "body": "I'll be honest, the amount of time I've spent waiting around in a game while various friends get themselves ready probably exceeds the time I actually spend playing the game. With something like Peak , where you need to all be present at the very start of the game, the chances of everyone being ready at the time we've agreed to is next to none. So, having ways to pass the time while you wait for someone to make a cup of tea, eat their dinner, or return from the heavy fog they've somehow disappeared into in the time it took for them to reply to a message and join the game, is essential. However, the opportunities to pass time in the airport before you set off on your climbing adventure in Peak are incredibly limited. Or at least they were until now. You have a climbing wall, and aside from running up and down the travelator, you're stuck for any activities really. Luckily, the \"Dillydally mini-update\" has rolled out, adding two new games to the airport to keep you entertained until it's time to head off. You'll now be able to make use of a basketball court and chess board, which is bound to distract my friends even further before we actually get to climb any mountains. Although you…",

If you are at that point (and also plan on moving to China), Maxsun has you sorted. If not, well, it's still quite a pretty design all things considered. As spotted by VideoCardz , Maxsun has announced the GeForce RTX 5070 iCraft OC12G AIGA Plus S0 . This is very similar to the RTX 5070 iCraft OC12G AIGA , which it launched earlier this year. Both have three fans, and both GPUs have the same imagery spinning on those fans. Where the older model has a blue and white tint to said imagery, the newer one combines a grey and pink. However, spin that GPU around and you will spot a big change. On the back of this RTX 5070 card sits an anime cat girl with blue hair, a top hat, and a waistcoat. This gives her a magician's look. The previous card also has a cat girl, but a hole in the rear plate of the GPU gets in the way of the image, which means the new card will get you a smidge more cat girl, should you care a lot about cat girl economics. Speaking of cat girl economics, though you may demand it, the supply of this card is solely within China, so yo…",

    "body": "I've only played about five hours of Baby Steps , but if there's one thing I've learned during that time, it's that you always need to have complete visibility over where Nate is putting his feet. Since this is a \"walking simulator\" and this logic applies to real life too, it may seem overly obvious. And it might be. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I know I'm not alone in that. Baby Steps is played from a third-person perspective and it lets you change whether the camera is oriented to the left or right of Nate. But during the trickier traversal scenarios, such as when you're navigating a very narrow bridge or even something as thin as a tightrope, I found that it was basically essential to train that camera on Nate's feet via a top -down perspective. Just seeing Nate's legs is not enough! Just like this (thanks to Morgan Park for the video): In other words, don't just let the camera languish on Nate's butt. Move it around, but especially move it up. The physics in Baby Steps are detailed and fun to mess with, but even when you're just walking along seemingly safe surfaces, a simple obscurely placed rock can send you tumbling. It's fine to fall—sometimes in Baby Steps you have to fall—but…",

The only paths back up involved even tricker rocks, and predictably I fell again, tumbling off the grassy ledge to land next to a mudslide. Fortunately there was a dry path beside the mud, and unfortunately I found a single rock on that path, tripped, hit the mudslide, and slid to the bottom of it. Walking back up that path I managed to slip into the mud twice more, the second time achieving such slippery velocity I flung myself back to a previous biome, landing in a lake. That motivated me to try a different route entirely, heading back toward a labyrinth of cardboard called Box Hell, at which point I spotted a ladder leaning against the hill I somehow completely missed the first time through this area, and which let me bypass all that mud-and-rock…",

    "body": "Did you know that there's a whole range of Warhammer TTRPGs out there, covering all of Games Workshop's core settings? You can read all about them right here on PC Gamer, in fact. But now, thanks to Humble Bundle, you can also get started with almost all of the current range in one go for just $25. The aptly named Warhammer RPG Starter Bundle offers a robust start for four of publisher Cubicle 7's games, only missing out The Old World (understandable—it only just came out). That includes: Age of Sigmar: Soulbound (Image credit: Cubicle Seven) A fantastic game for Warhammer's most underrated setting. Soulbound is set up for serious power fantasy—parties are far stronger and more influential than your average gang of D&D adventurers, allowing you to throw giants, dragons, and greater daemons at them while they fight for the fate of entire realms. The bundle includes the core book, starter set, and a full campaign, among other bits—so it really is everything you need to get a campaign going. Warhammer Fantasy Role Play (Image credit: Cubicle 7, Games Workshop) I have misgivings with WFRP's now very outdated core system, but looking past its mechanical clunkiness, it's still one of th…",

    "body": "Phoenix Point is one of the X-COM tree's most interesting branches. Where Firaxis created a modern, flashy, accessible variation of the original X-COM, the series creator, Julian Gollop, took a different approach. Phoenix Point maintained the original's complexity, elevated the strategic side of things dramatically and gave us tactical battles built on a detailed physics simulation. Unfortunately, it was rife with bugs at launch, and probably didn't get the fair shake it deserved thanks to its status as an Epic exclusive. It would take another year for it to come to Steam. Gollop remembers it as a \"very difficult project\". \"We reached a really great big audience with that one,\" he tells us. \"It was a very difficult project to do. With crowdfunding, you make promises which you don't know if you're going to be able to deliver. And we obviously tried very hard. We had all these backer builds that came out once every two or three months. Progress towards the final game was getting slower, though, and the game is complex. The original release was not perfect, shall we say, although we did continue working on it for quite a while. And then a year later, the Steam release was much improv…",
