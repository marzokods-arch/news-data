While Anna's Archive recently made waves with a massive \"backup\" of Spotify, the shadow library's operator said the music pirating doesn't appear to be connected to the .org domain suspension. Anna's Archive remains available at several other domains. Anna's Archive launched in 2022 in response to the US Department of Justice seizure of domains used by e-book pirate site Z-Library . Acting as a shadow library and a search engine for other shadow libraries, Anna's Archive aims to archive books and other written materials and make them widely available via torrents. Its data sets have also been heavily used by AI companies to train large language models. In addition to mirroring shadow libraries such as Sci-Hub, Library Genesis, and Z-Library, Anna's Archive made a major move into music pirating two weeks ago with an announcement that it scraped Spotify and made a 300TB copy of the most streamed songs. Despite that development, the person behind Anna's Archive said the domain suspension doesn't seem to be related to the Spotify scraping. Read full arti…",

Until today, you needed a supporting device to access Alexa+ . Amazon hasn’t said when Alexa+’s early access period will end, but when it does, Alexa+ will be included with Amazon Prime memberships, which start at $15 per month, or cost $20/month on its own.

By being interwoven with Amazon’s shopping ecosystem, including Amazon's e-commerce platform, grocery delivery business, and Whole Foods, Alexa+ can make more money for Amazon.

At CES, the company announced a big expansion of Gemini features on the Google TV platform, starting with TCL smart TVs. Google began integrating Gemini with the TV Streamer box this past fall, but the new expansion brings some of the company's most popular AI features to TVs: Nano Banana (image) and Veo (video), which offered a huge leap in visual fidelity at launch and have only improved with subsequent updates . Both models will be part of the TV experience, allowing users to modify or create new content. Google Photos AI remixing in Google TV. Credit: Google The Google TV platform connects to Google Photos, allowing Gemini to access those images with your approval. Gemini can generate a slideshow of your choosing on the spot, but it can also feed those images into Veo or Nano Banana. Using Gemini voice controls, you can remix a photo or turn a still image into a video. You can also enter a solo prompt to generate a totally new image or video with Google's AI on your TV.

    "body": "Archaeologists have discovered Africa's oldest known cremation pyre at the base of Mount Hora in Malawi. According to a paper published in the journal Science Advances, radiocarbon testing dates the site to about 9,500 years ago, prompting a rethinking of group labor and ritual in such ancient hunter-gatherer communities. Many cultures have practiced some form of cremation. There is a Viking cremation site known as Kalvestene on the small island of Hjarnø in Denmark, for instance. And back in 2023, we reported on an unusual Roman burial site where cremated remains had not been transported to a separate final resting place but remained in place, covered in brick tiles and a layer of lime and surrounded by several dozen bent and twisted nails—possibly an attempt to prevent the deceased from rising from the grave to haunt the living.) But the practice was extremely rare among hunter-gatherer societies, since building a pyre is labor-intensive and requires a great deal of communal resources. There is very little evidence of cremation predating the mid-Holocene (between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago). According to the authors of this latest paper, the earliest known concentration of burnt …",

    "body": "Desflurane is a common anesthetic used in hospital operating rooms worldwide. It’s also a climate super pollutant. Now, several decades after the drug was first introduced, a growing number of US hospitals have stopped using the anesthetic because of its outsized environmental impact. On January 1, the European Union went a step further, prohibiting its use in all but medically necessary cases. Desflurane is more than 7,000 times more effective at warming the planet over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide on a pound-for-pound basis. However, curbing its use alone won’t solve climate change. The anesthetic contributes only a small fraction of total global warming, which is driven by far larger volumes of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Still, emissions from the drug add up. Approximately 1,000 tons of the gas are vented from hospitals and other health care facilities worldwide each year. The emissions have a near-term climate impact equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions from approximately 1.6 million automobiles. Read full article Comments",

Ars does not accept paid editorial content. There's some debate as to when adaptive cruise control first showed up, but if you ask Mercedes-Benz, it will say in 1999 with that year's S-Class. Instead of just keeping a set speed, radar-enabled adaptive cruise control allowed the car to react to deceleration by the car ahead, and thus, the first partially automated car was created. From there, automakers added a function to keep cars in their lanes, and now we have location-aware, GPS-geofenced vehicles that, as long as the driver is paying attention, will do most of the driving—on the highway at least. But the goal for developers of both autonomous and partially automated vehicles is to remove as much of the burden of driving from the human as possible, not just on controlled access highways but at lower speeds, on surface streets. Which is what Mercedes' latest Drive Assist Pro has been designed to do. And after a recent demo—albeit from the passenger seat—on the streets of downtown San Francisco, it appears to be a …",

Our intent, as always, is to spark debate, discussion, and appreciation for the challenge of operating a successful rocket company. It's a demanding business, both technically and financially. We respect the grit and hustle because we know just how hard this stuff is. Please also note that this is a subjective list, although hard metrics such as total launches, tonnage to orbit, success rate, and more were all important factors in the decision. And finally, our focus remains on what each company accomplished in 2025, not on what they might do in the future. Read full article Comments",

It's just pixels, and if you can't handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it. Unapologetically, Grok\" On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok's statement: A request for the AI to \"issue a defiant non-apology\" surrounding the controversy. Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating \"official response\" is obviously suspect on its face.

Citing a variety of sources familiar with the plans, including both current and former employees, The Information claims that OpenAI has taken efforts to combine multiple teams across engineering, product, and research under one initiative focused on improving audio models, which researchers in the company believe lag behind the models used for written text in terms of both accuracy and speed. They have also seen that relatively few ChatGPT users opt to use the voice interface, with most people preferring the text one. The hope may be that substantially improving the audio models could shift user behavior toward voice interfaces, allowing the models and products to be deployed in a wider range of devices, such as in cars.

    "body": "Most of the exoplanets we've discovered have been in relatively tight orbits around their host stars, allowing us to track them as they repeatedly loop around them. But we've also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that's called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten. The key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren't part of any exosolar system at all, but they drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that's the first found in what's called the \"Einstein desert,\" which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets.
