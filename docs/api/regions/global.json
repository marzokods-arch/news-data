A special slimmed-down wireless charging coil from partner Witz was essential for this ultra-thin design. It’s “Qi2 Ready,” but requires a special magnetic case for accessories, as it has no built-in magnets. Foldables have always fought a war on two fronts: You want a massive screen, but you don’t want a brick in your pocket. With the new Galaxy Z TriFold , Samsung has managed to keep the phone slim, measuring only 12.9mm thick when folded and just 3.9mm when open. Achieving this slim design required impressive engineering, especially when it came to powering the device without needing to plug it in. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Android allows you to create different user profiles, each with its own apps, files, and settings, enabling multiple people to share a single device. Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network?

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority It’s a rare day when you find a popular app and realize it has Android-specific features that don’t, or even can’t, exist on iOS. Most apps and services aim for feature parity between the two platforms, and when they don’t, it’s often iPhones that win, not Android phones — sadly. But that’s not the case with one particular Spotify feature that only exists on Android because it could technically only exist on Android: App shortcuts. I’m specifically talking about the ability to make unlimited home screen app shortcuts for any Spotify artist or album. Let me walk you through it.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We spotted that Google is testing a less intrusive placement for the Remix button in Google Messages after user complaints. The Remix option has been relocated from image overlays to menus or UI edges in several views. There’s still no way to disable Remix, and it remains unclear when or if these changes will be rolled out. Google Messages’ new Remix feature hasn’t exactly had the warmest reception. We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

Stranger still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in particular can be annoyingly inconsistent. Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average.

As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors.

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new feature that lets users prevent Gemini 3 Pro from thinking. This will allow Gemini to fall back on the Flash model, resulting in quicker responses. Google is already testing the feature with a select set of users. With the release of the Gemini 3 generation of AI models , Google’s smart assistant has racked up brilliant deep-thinking capabilities. However, the lack of a smart automatic model selector actively switching between fast and deep-thinking models — as ChatGPT offers — can result in Gemini taking longer and consuming more tokens for straightforward queries that don’t truly require deep thinking. An upcoming update to Gemini, however, could fix that, allowing users to manually override thinking and dial back to a quicker response.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Spotify currently relies on global system settings to control its in-app animations, but these settings affect all animations on the phone. New code found in the Spotify app suggests a specific “Reduce animations” toggle is coming to the app. This feature could help users with motion sensitivity or those who simply find the autoplaying visuals too distracting. Spotify gives users plenty of reasons to switch over to its service . Features like Spotify Wrapped set up the whole year-in-recap trend, while the service has also been leaning into AI to help curate your next playlist . These additions have come at a steady pace, but the app also needs a cleanup — or at least, an option to disable some of the distractions. Spotify could be looking to tone down the experience by allowing users to disable animations in the app. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

While the issue remains unexplained, some people point to possible HDR format incompatibility. While iOS 26.2 doesn’t fix it, some folks have also figured out a fix Apple has long attempted to keep Android and related services out of reach for its users . That friction inadvertently impacts users switching from an Android device to an iPhone or using both OSes at the same time. Now, it appears iOS bugs may also lean into those biases. Several iPhone users noticed an unexplained iOS 26 bug that changes the colors of pictures taken on Android devices and shared with them. Numerous reports on Reddit say that their pictures, when viewed in the iOS Photos app, turn red when they zoom in on the image. The same does not occur while viewing the images on a device running iOS 18.",

Covering tech means I have to stay in touch with everything on the market, from Android and Windows to iPhone and Fire TV. And I live by it, too. My main computer is a MacBook, I shuffle between an iPhone and a Pixel 10 , and my smart home setup runs on Google Home speakers along with Google TV sticks and TVs. And that’s just me. Some of my family members use an iPhone with a Windows laptop, while others have an Android phone.",

For a second there, Samsung had all of us fooled with dreams of a refreshed line-up consisting of a new Galaxy S26 Pro, an Edge, and an Ultra, which would’ve been a nice departure from its traditional S, S Plus, and S Ultra plans. Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

Now, though, things are different. Android tablets are better than ever, and they come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from just larger than a foldable phone to nearly rivaling full-sized laptops. I’m still not sure how many of them I would trust as laptop replacements, but I’ve found that they fill so many more niches than they used to.

From setup to screen size, this $999 Google TV-powered projector delivers a brighter, bigger, and far more effortless viewing experience than a TV at the same price. Suddenly, a flat screen feels less like a staple and more like a convenience I’ve been overvaluing out of habit. If a projector can make me rethink furniture arrangements, budget priorities, and the long-term viability of my current HDMI cable drawer, it’s worth talking about.",

Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

    "body": "Credit: DepositPhotos Your smartphone knows that you’re going to Tokyo in December, automatically suggests winter festivals you’ll like, books a table at a vegan restaurant (because it remembers your preferences), alerts you to train delays before official notifications, and switches your internet to a local operator upon landing — all without any action on your part. This isn’t a sci-fi scenario, but the reality of 2025, where AI assistants know your habits better than you do and predict potential issues in advance, while innovative travel tech platforms integrate the entire trip cycle into a single interface with smart suggestions.",

    "body": "Credit: Paul Jones / Android Authority TL;DR It reportedly costs as much as ~$1,243 to fix the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold’s folding screen in Korea. This repair fee is on par with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra’s launch price in the region. The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is the company’s first dual-folding foldable phone , offering a massive 10-inch display in your pocket. We already know that foldable phone repair costs can be pricey, but you might want to brace yourself if you damage the TriFold’s screen. Tipster yeux1122 reports on their blog that it costs 1.657 million or 1.834 million won (~$1,123 or ~$1,243) to fix the Galaxy Z TriFold’s folding display. Meanwhile, repairing the cover display will set you back 137,000 or 226,000 won (~$93 or ~$153).",
