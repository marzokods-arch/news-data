The difference-maker here is that, rather than twisting the cube to create a solid colour on each face, you're trying to form six of Tetris' tetrominoes, and can then show off your handiwork thanks to a stand shaped like the line tetromino. All very nice, but perhaps the best thing to come out of this is a meeting between Ernő Rubik, the Hungarian architect and inventor of the cube (among many other things), and Alexey Pajitnov, the Russian creator of Tetris. Rubik is a cool customer but you can tell that Pajitnov is absolutely over the moon, filled with boyish excitement at meeting one of his heroes, and pays tribute to the original Rubik's cube in soaring terms. \"Basically, I am so excited about meeting Mr. Rubik today,\" says Pajitnov. \"I would think that this cube is what people don't appreciate in full, because I think that's the symbol of modern civilisation. \"If I would put something as evidence of human civilisation on the outside...on the interstellar space object, that would be one of the ten objects I would definitely put on…",

Today, I sat down for the first time in 2026, only to see that the memory supply crisis is well and truly having a knock-on effect on SSD pricing. Our Jeremy has already been keeping an eye on surging PC hardware prices , but this morning presented a more recent example. I just wrote a deal post about the 1 TB version of the Lexar NM790 NVMe SSD which, today, is going for $118. Not terrible, right? Well, that's what I thought until I remembered I had in fact written about the same SSD back in October of last year—when it was only $66. That is a close to 50% price increase in about four months. Even worse, this same drive cost almost $150 within the last month according to Amazon price tracker Camelcamelcamel . The Lexar is far from the most egregious increase I've seen, with higher capacity SSDs more severely affected. For one extreme example, Best Buy is currently asking for over a grand for the 4 TB version of the WD_Black SN850X SSD. It's hard to rule this out as simply a listing error when Newegg is asking for $520 for the same drive . If we look back at my Am…",

    "body": "We've had the chance to do some quick game testing of Panther Lake , Intel's latest generation of mobile chips, and we are impressed. That's good news for a company that has looked like it's been a bad place for far too long. I'm happy to hear that future Intel laptops could have good gaming chops without a dedicated GPU, but it's not just the gaming performance that has wowed me thus far. It's something much more mundane: multi-day laptop battery life. AMD's SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, recently took a swing at Panther Lake , and part of the argumentation is that consumers buy chips based on needs, rather than going for a little bit of everything. In this, Tikoo argues that AMD offers the top of the line for gaming, and therefore, gamers will pick AMD. However, as someone who games a lot, I don't actually look for the absolute best gaming performance out of my laptop. I look for 'good enough' gaming, plus solid ergonomics, a decent weight, and most importantly, strong battery life. Panther Lake, with its sprinkling of P, E, LPE, and Xe3 cores , is being promised to offer an estimated up to 27 hours of Netflix streaming , which is up to 60% more than Lunar Lake…",

Baldur's Gate 3 made significant changes to characters and story arcs from its early access launch, so it's a fool's errand to even attempt to pin anything down at this point. But when's that ever stopped anyone? In the Divinity AMA with the studio, Redditor 'ilikebreadabunch' found the only opening and took it, asking Larian if there's a small spoiler that it could give that won't make any sense until we've actually played the game. Larian obliged, and writing director Adam Smith simply replied , \"Alligator\". Well…uh, that certainly fits the bill. Even if it's a main story spoiler, perhaps a character's final words (that would be an odd choice, I'll admit), good luck getting anything of use from it. With no confirmed release date or even window right now, we'll be waiting a long time before we find out what this clue's all about. I'm grasping at straws here, but perhaps there'll be a fight against alligators, similar to the infamous killer crocs in Divinity: Original Sin 2's opening area of Fort Joy. …",

He's so straightforwardly good as to be, well, maybe a little dull, and he even gets outshone by other characters in some of his own big plot scenes—not because of a deficit in his performance, but because of how those scenes were written. It turns out that Wyll's writer, Kevin VanOrd (who also wrote Lae'zel, by the by), knows just how fans feel. In a Q&A on Reddit , VanOrd wrote in response to a question from a disappointed Wyll-liker that \"I wish Wyll had gotten more content and a more fulfilling arc too.\" Alas, it sounds like circumstances conspired to make that difficult, if not impossible, to do. \"We weren't connecting with Wyll's early access recruitment and initial questing,\" writes VanOrd, \"so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid.\" Way back when, before BG3 left early access, Wyll was a different sort of character and even had a different actor, Lanre Malaolu .

According to Gigabyte, HyperNits is, \"a smart tuning feature leveraging a unique algorithm to intelligently reshape the EOTF curve. HyperNits boosts brightness by up to 30% while preserving critical highlight detail. Users can choose between HyperNits High for maximum brightness enhancement or HyperNits Medium for a gentle 20% lift in darker environments.\" It's not totally clear, but this very much looks like a similar technical solution to MSI's EOTF Boost feature, as seen in multiple MSI OLED monitors, including and most recently the excellent MSI MPG 341CQR QD-OLED X36 I reviewed a week or so ago.

Sure, it's the studio's \"biggest game ever\" , shifting back to Larian's own world after the success of Baldur's Gate 3 , but we're left with little more than an atmosphere after its bloody reveal trailer at The Game Awards . That said, I don't really care that much because Larian has confirmed the only news that matters. When asked about the way defences would work in Divinity, head of design Nick Pechenin explained that it would \"not keep the magic armor system from DOS2\", and that's music to my ears. Comment from r/Games For the uninitiated, Divinity: Original Sin 2 split protection into two categories: physical and magical. The problem is that these were effectively two different additional health bars for enemies, weakened by two entirely separate types of damage, and you'd need to break at least one. What this meant is that you were generally much better off having your party focus on either physical or magical damage to break your chosen type faster, rather than using a mixed party and splitting damage between the two types. Plus, you were often be…",

Furthering this point, Stoakes says, \"Thinking LLMs are 'just another tool' is to say effectively that the kernel is immune from this. Which seems to me a silly position.\" This is where Torvalds comes into the conversation . He says, \"No. Your position is the silly one. There is *zero* point in talking about AI slop.

Embark Studios hasn't confirmed a roadmap for Arc Raiders yet, but there are some things we're very likely to see, at the very least, before 2027 creeps up on us. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Following on from the last few months, I'd bet that raiders will get to experience new map conditions, weapons, arc mobs, raider decks, and hopefully even some new community events. When it comes to map conditions, I wouldn't be surprised if we got a desert condition sometime in the summer, like the Cold Snap , but in reverse. I'd also like to see something like a Wacky Raid, where the arc behaviour is really weird, the mobs spawn in locations you'd usually not find them in, and the loot makes absolutely no sense for where you'd find it. It sounds fun (and horrifying) finding a leaper wedged into the hallways of Dam Control Tower, although that's likely a pipe dream. But you know what isn't? New mobs. From the beginning, pl…",

That being said, a lack of real competition is the root of complacency, and I for one would like to see Steam continue to improve, especially as it invades the living room with its second and much more promising attempt at the Steam Machine .

There was an immediate and intense reaction as fans wondered what this meant for the studio's future games. Would Divinity be stuffed with AI slop? Would it be built with gen AI trained on artwork of dubious provenance? Eventually, Larian promised a Reddit Q&A session to give players a bit of transparency into the studio, its processes, and how it's using AI. Or how it's not using AI, I guess.

But now I've found something else to quell my urges, and no it's not a therapist. I'm actually talking about Chosen Garden, a new roguelike deckbuilder that's set to come out March this year. I've been playing its little demo, and I have a wonderfully awful feeling that it's going to do the job too well.

The first came in for criticism from progressive voices over representation and its depiction of the conflict between the Czech protagonists and their Cuman enemies, while the second game managed to upset the opposite end of the political spectrum by featuring gay romance and positively portrayed Romani, Jewish, and Muslim characters. For its part, Warhorse is rather tired of talking about it. The studio told us last year that it was \"fed up\" of being dragged into culture wars and wanted only \"to make a cool videogame,\" but when I got the chance to chat with Martin Klíma, studio co-founder and KCD2 executive producer, about KCD2 taking PCG's 2025 GOTY award , I had to take a second to ask: did he think the controversies actually impacted the series at all, in terms of sales, reception, or developer morale? Klíma said that, really, it was difficult to tell. \"I would really, really like to know the answer to this one,\" he said. \"You can really convincingly argue both ways.

Which makes it a great pity that they're not available for older generations of AMD GPUs, like RDNA 3. The just possibly good news is that, in a new interview, AMD has left the door ever so slightly ajar for that happening in future. For many, the frustration is that many of these new upscaling features can be made to run on RDNA 3 graphics and indeed, community-based hacks have achieved just that , albeit with mixed results. So why won't AMD give that effort some official support? Speaking with PC World , Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President at AMD and the guy responsible for various driver features, including FSR upscaling technologies, explained that the lack of official support for the latest FSR tech on RDNA 3 basically comes down to the difficulty in delivering a consistent experience. But when asked if there could be \"an opportunity to make a beta version of Redstone that will run on RDNA 3,\" his answer is at least a little promising. \"That's currently not in the plan, but thanks for the hint.

I've run the numbers, with a little help from AI-powered transcription, and the mentions of AI are rather staggering. If you thought Nvidia was emperor of AI, think again. The company's presentation was primarily focused on AI and robotics, but it logged a mere 120 mentions of AI during its 91 minute runtime. That's only 1.3 mentions of AI per minute (AI/min). AMD's CES keynote , led by Dr. Lisa Su, hit a staggering 210 mentions of AI. That was over a longer runtime of 117 minutes, though it works out to a much higher 1.8 AI/min.

As helpfully laid out in Yukidama's YouTube video , an EMR tablet is one that uses Electromagnetic Resonance that sends a signal to a tablet, which is then translated by the tablet. It's a quick and responsive bit of technology, but different pen vendors work off different frequencies, which can impact compatibility. The video shows how electromagnetic pencils have coils and capacitors near the tip; a test board picks up that frequency and uses a signal amplifier to send that information to a computer. With an oscilloscope, Yukidama measures the frequency of each pencil as it touches the board, and then that frequency as they press harder. Two different pens register two different frequencies. This project uses a smart array of coils in the tablet itself, making it \"compatible with most commercial pens from different vendors, offeri…",

    "body": "Intel went on record at CES about a planned version of its new Panther Lake chip specifically configured for handheld gaming PCs but didn't provide any details. Now Videocardz claims the chip will be branded \"Intel Core G3 Extreme\" and have the same iGPU as Panther Lake in laptops. That means the Core G3 will get the same 12 Xe3-spec graphics cores as the top-spec Panther Lake chips for laptops. However, the leak claims that some concessions have been made to squeeze Panther Lake into the handheld form factor. On the iGPU side, it's said that clock speeds have been reduced from the 2.5 GHz of laptop chips like the Core Ultra X9 388H to 2.3 GHz. No doubt the idea is to reduce power consumption without noticeably impacting frame rates. That slight reduction in clock speed has apparently been enough to have Intel rebrand the iGPU from Intel Arc B390 in the top laptop variants of Panther Lake to Intel Arc B380 for the Intel Core G3 Extreme. As for the CPU of the Panther Lake package, that's had a bit more of a haircut. The full-spec Panther Lake configuration in the aforementioned Core Ultra X9 388H has four Performance cores, eight Efficient cores and four Low Power Efficient cores. …",

CES 2026 (Image credit: Future) Catch up with CES 2026 : We're on the ground in sunny Las Vegas covering all the latest announcements from some of the biggest names in tech, including Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Razer, MSI and more. Now, I know it wasn't AI all the way down. There was still plenty of delightful CES weirdness in the form InWin's fresh signature chassis that looks not unlike a futuristic glass egg , as well as yet another rollable laptop concept machine from Lenovo . I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention at least one questionable consumer doo-dad too, such as Lollipopstar , a lollipop that attempts to turn \"candy into a concert in your mouth.\" No, I will not be elaborating further. But, even setting aside the hours our poor Andy spent locked inside Lenovo's AI sphere of despair , a number of exhibitors at this year's CES focussed on AI.

Researcher and developer Jenny Guanni Qu recently looked at the Linux kernel's bug fixes and found tons of them stick around for a very long time. As someone who feels the allure of Linux distributions and occasionally succumbs to it before quickly scarpering back to Windows when confronted with bugs—usually small and irksome ones, but occasionally catastrophic —this information does not help me. So if you're the same as me: you're welcome. Qu built a tool to filter through Linux kernel changes and used it to filter for every fix since 2005. \"Six hours later, I had 125,183 vulnerability records.\" Looking at these fixes, she found that the average lifetime of a bug, ie, a bug existing and potentially causing problems for users, was 2.1 years over the 20-year time frame.

There are two big reasons for this. The first comes from IGN Poland , which said earlier this week ( Google translated ) that it first heard about this new expansion, \"from someone who has repeatedly provided us with reliable insider information,\" years ago. IGN Poland said it didn't publish anything about it at the time because the information all came from a single source (that's how actual journalism works), but in light of these new rumors it's opted to make the story public. IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could succ…",

To me, that was Fallout. So, that was the first thing, the first asset. The next iconic thing was the Pip-Boy. It's kind of an abstracted thing in the early games. But we wanted it to be an actual, physical device that you wear on your wrist. Then it was the Vault suit…\" Bethesda's take on the Vault suit, incidentally, is a little more straightforward than the original designer intended: Tim Cain recently spoke about how his idea was that the suits would be \"extruded\" from a machine on demand . Either way, Pely definitely succeeded in fleshing …",

I'm a fan of the studio's work in general, and I loved the way SOMA took the aging Amnesia formula and somehow made it better (and so much worse) by dialing back the in-the-moment horror of oh jeez gonna die and injecting a healthy dose of existential nightmares that's left me still occasionally thinking, more than 10 years later, man, what would I do? In light of those good times, I'm very happy to hear that Ontos aims to go even harder on that more cerebral take on horror. \"In your more standard horror game, say the first Amnesia, the focus is to have players survive in a scary environment. The intent is to evoke a very primal sense of fear,\" Frictional Games creative director Thomas Grip told GamesRadar . \"In Ontos, the focus is more cerebral. It is about encountering strange, often very disturbing, situations where the player is tasked with figuring out the best approach. So, where your typical Amnesia-like game has you encountering a stalking monster, Ontos puts you face to face with a man trapped inside a computer made out of rats.\" That \"computer made out of rat…",

From the comments on my CES live blog , to those on TikTok, to various threads on Reddit, to our own reaction on team; gamers keep saying similar things. 'Everything is too expensive' is a common response to any announcement from the show. With RAM prices skyrocketing and this being leveraged for price increases elsewhere, there is a sense of existential doom across the entire PC building market. Things aren't that bad—not yet—but it's going to be a bumpy ride for the rest of the year, if not longer, as prices are still on the rise. I've been scrolling through CES coverage on TikTok and YouTube and sticker shock—the gut reaction to finding out a product's high price—is a constant. Then there's AI.

Asus has partnered with boutique headphone manufacturer Hifiman to bring planar magnetic drivers to its new gaming headset, the Asus ROG Kithara . For those not in the know, planar magnetic drivers use a magnet-suspended diaphragm to deliver exceptionally crisp and accurate audio, which makes them highly-prized among audiophiles. Our best audiophile headphones pick, the Audeze Maxwell , uses a similar pair—but it looks like there's some new competition in town. I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows. Watching a clip of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay, the impact sounds were pretty jawbone-rumbling. The open-backed wired set was plugged in to a substantial DAC/amplifier combo, so they were obviously being pushed quite heavily, but boy did it make for some serious air movement.

Except, that is, for monitors and what looks to me like the most exciting gaming display of 2026. I give you the LG UltraGear Evo 39GX950B , all 39 inches of it. This new gaming monitor has so much going for it. It gets LG's latest OLED panel tech (albeit minus the RGB-stripe subpixel layout ) and a 5K2K native resolution. That's 5,120 by 2,160 pixels. It's basically a 4K 16:9 pixel grid taken out to 21:9 aspect ultrawide. More specifically, it's essentially a 32-inch 16:9 monitor stretched out to 21:9. That means the 140-ish DPI pixel density is the same as a 32-inch 4K panel. Personally, when it comes to the best compromise between crispy precision for day-to-day computing and maybe creative workflows, overall panel size for immersion and tolerable GPU load for gaming, 32-inch 4K makes more sense than 27-inch 4K. The latter has better pixel density, for sure. But that's barely noticeable for games, and yet you will feel the smaller, less immersive panel size.

But it's also iconic for the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS), which sees you using your Pip Boy to target and pop-pop body parts of various wasteland uglies. While it'd be hard to think of a Fallout game without VATS underlying it, linking gunplay to the classic RPG elements of its predecessors, Fallout 3—the first Fallout game after Bethesda acquired the licence—almost threw the gunplay out with the… uh, gunwater. I've lost track of this metaphor. That's per an interview in the latest issue of Edge (thanks, Gamesradar ). Speaking to lead artist Istvan Pely, it was revealed that \"there were some significant challenges figuring out VATS. There was a long period where it was like, 'Is this even fun? Is this worth doing at all? Is anyone even going to use this?'\" To hear Pely describe it, it was a right pain in the butt to get it all sorted—even camera positioning was a big challenge: \"We spent so much time basically trying to get the game to figure out where to put the camera so you could see the slow-motion playback.

Your job is simple: you must turn around the last remaining video rental store and make it profitable in the face of a new challenger, RentNet—a digital streaming service that's well before its time.

Nvidia is obviously utterly consumed by all things AI, plus maybe a touch of memory crisis management. So, there were no new GPUs from Team Green .

But the whole Arm-on-PC thing still has so much to prove, the jury isn't just out, it hasn't even been vetted yet. Which leaves Intel and Panther Lake. Being pretty much the only genuinely new PC chip at CES means you could get the impression it wins the excitement prize simply by default. It comes first in a race of one, in other words. Strictly, that's true. But Panther Lake is also genuinely exciting for several reasons. For PC gaming, it's the new Arc B390 iGPU that's most compelling.

Tikoo said \"Strix Halo or Ryzen AI Max will kill it\" and that \"it's not even a fair fight at that point.\" He added that AMD's top-end chips are \"better than that in terms of graphics performance\" and that those looking for gaming will be buying gaming-specific chips anyway. In terms of performance, Tikoo points out Intel's benchmark results for Panther Lake were compared to lower-end and older Ryzen chips: \"They compared their highest-end to our midpoint.\" Earlier this week, Intel reported that its Core Ultra Series 3 Panther Lake chips are up to 77% faster in regard to gaming performance than Lunar Lake.
