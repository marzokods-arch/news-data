    "body": "Former Elder Scrolls Online director Matt Firor has revealed his reason for unexpectedly leaving ZeniMax Online Studios in July 2025 after nearly 20 years with the company, and it will probably come as no surprise that Microsoft's summertime bloodbath is to blame. Microsoft laid off roughly 9,000 people on July 2, 2025, many of them from its Xbox division—a massacre made even more grotesque by the words of Xbox chief Phil Spencer, who said as the axe fell that the company's gaming business had \"never looked stronger,\" The cuts also included multiple cancellations including the Perfect Dark reboot (and the closure of the studio making it), Rare's Everwild project, and an unannounced MMO in development at ZeniMax, codenamed Blackbird. Happy New Year everyone. I’ve been pretty quiet the last six months, but I posted this message on LinkedIn late yesterday just to give everyone an update.

But like most puzzle games, I binged it once with no plans to return until my withering hippocampus had fully lost all the puzzle solutions. To my elation, 2026 is starting with a delightful surprise: a major update to Baba Is You with all sorts of new words, objects and modding tools. The update is detailed in a Steam community blog post , which reasons \"This will most probably be the final large update for BIY.\" It seems to be primarily targeted at modders, but contains five new words for use in custom levels: become, facedby, hold, happy, and angry. If you've never played Baba is You, words change the way a given level works as you construct condition-altering sentences. For instance, Baba is Happy would theoretically make the player character happy… what effect that would have on a puzzle, I'm not sure. There's also a bunch of new sprites, including a fox, a bean, a hot dog, a cactus, and so on.

Some players aren't so impressed by the promise to implement a Creator Marketplace for user-generated content, which is to say: paid mods. While you can buy DLC to play games like Zombicide in Tabletop Simulator, the Steam Workshop is where the real action is.

This time around, New Blood is promising the game's biggest explorable area yet, which means it's a great time to try all those spooky new toys. The Hightown Update comes after a short delay, but dropped just in time for a New Year's Day celebration. The release trailer shows off some of the new areas and a new weapon: a revolver with a rifle stock and a scope slapped on. A teaser blog post on Steam said the new patch contains both \"largest, most vertical open area\" and \"the most sophisticated, lethal and complex enemy force\" yet seen in Gloomwood, and shows off more of the new areas, which look suitably gothic and dismal. Back when the patch was delayed around Christmas, developer Dillon Rogers said on X that the new revolver-rifle would help players \"tackle those pesky constable snipers.\" My experience with Gloomwood is limited, but I do love a stealth game with winding, open s…",

Seehorn is best known for starring alongside Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul, but her work stretches back into the '90s. As it turns out, one of her earliest live action roles was in, of all things, a Magic: The Gathering game by Microprose. It is as hilarious, blurry, and gloriously low-budget as you'd hope. All the hallmarks of cheesy '90s PC game fantasy are on proud display here, with the actors superimposed over primitive CG backgrounds. The full tutorial appears to contain well over an hour of dictated instruction and probably isn't the best way to learn a notoriously complex card game (especially since this is nearly 30 years old), but it's admirably committed to the bit. Any video of the tutorial is now festooned with comments mentioning Seehorn's character in Pluribus, jokingly factoring the role into the show's canon. You might know…",

So despite the paper-thin premise, this is actually a great idea for a quiz! Right? I'll keep it simple, though: the answer to every question in today's quiz is Doom , Dune , Both , or Neither . That's it! I'll give you a prompt, and you tell me if it's true of Doom, Dune, both of them, or neither. Good luck, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

All of that said, a whopping 34 bits of kit earned a review score of either 90% or higher— that's 4 more than last year . But what was simply the best? It's interesting to note that only one bit of hardware among the highest-rated six costs less than $100. Spoiler alert, it's the Arctic Freezer 36 , going for a seriously impressive price tag that rests comfortably under $50. Still though, it's hard to ignore just how expensive PC gaming continues to be.

It speaks to the studio's deep bench and catalogue that in a year Obsidian launched two other games, The Outer Worlds 2 is still a standout. Obsidian's games rarely seem to get the praise they're due at launch, for one reason or another. Pillars of Eternity, Pentiment, and the first Outer Worlds strike me as notable exceptions.

I don't think 2025 is going to go down as a vintage year for the tech of our favourite hobby, but that doesn't mean we've been without either fantastic new toys to play with or new spins on gaming technology to throw at our games. Inevitably the biggest thing to happen to PCs in 2025 was two whole new generations of graphics cards launching from AMD and Nvidia respectively. Both had a lot to offer and both had a heap of problems—though interestingly they were largely more to do with marketing and product positioning than actual hardware issues…",

Subgenre trends happen all over gaming (the battle royale to extraction shooter pipeline, for instance) and cozy games are no exception. For a few years after Stardew Valley, absolutely everyone was making a farm sim. Then there was the influx of Townscaper-chasing cozy building games . This year it was the desktop idlers. (Image credit: Mister Morris Games, CaveLiquid, Moczan) They've got their roots back in the early 2000s when desktop pets were novelty applications that ran from your system tray in the bottom right. Back then, they were pretty minimal little apps that ran some simple animations and you could maybe have a couple interactions with. Desktop pets have completely evolved for their 2025 rebirth. No longer just glorified .gifs, they've become entire idler games ticking away in a fraction of your monitor just waiting for you to take a little break from work to poke at …",

It just shows off the game's \"game over\" screen, which sounds like the sort of thing that wouldn't be all that noteworthy, but the song slaps . Funky synth bass and warped, echoing samples glide over hip hop drums; it's the sort of dance-worthy defeat screen that salves the sting of losing in a frenzied arcade game. And if you haven't given Mindwave's demo a shot, that's exactly what it is. PC Gamer's Elie Gould sang the demo's praises in their impressions piece on it, and I similarly came away from it foaming at the mouth to play the full game. It's a chaotic mishmash of what WarioWare originally coined as \"micro-games\": dead simple minigames that you have mere seconds to complete, played one after another at mach speeds. It differentiates itself from the Nintendo series by being a bit more narrative; the Steam page bills it as \"…",

But there is something GPU-related that can be a lot better, and that's frame generation. Ever since GPU upscaling and frame generation first appeared (DLSS 1.0 in 2019, DLSS 3.0 in 2022), I've always held the opinion that if you couldn't tell they were working, other than just from the performance lift, everyone would be happily using them by default. With the first iteration of both technologies and their corresponding alternatives from AMD and Intel, you could very much tell they were being used, and that's only served to tarnish their reputations. However, when it comes to upscaling these days, it's about as close to perfection as you can get. Assuming it's been properly implemented into a game, of course.

Even if the latest hardware really was all that, the precarious AI bubble is locking normal humans out of it anyway. It's good timing, then, that cutting edge graphics are increasingly irrelevant to keeping up with the hobby.

It'd be an exaggeration to say the game's subreddit was pure misery between June and November, but there was more than enough gloom to go around: the novelty of a Star Wars cameo quickly wore off and the next two seasons, Super and Shock 'N Awesome, felt bland and messy. When players finally departed Oninoshima, Chapter 6's map, it was a sloppy soup of disconnected ideas, with First Order bases straddling bug-fighting military outposts and buildings from feudal Japan. I struggled to cajole my usual teammates to install updates over this period, let alone dedicate an evening to the game. I wasn't alone—the peak player count regularly dipped below 1.5m over this period, which would've seemed unthinkable a year ago. Yet 2025 also had some of my favorite Fortnite moments in years. The dopaminergic Blitz Royale arrived in June, and I played nothing else for weeks. The Fortnite Simpsons, complete with a standalone shrunken map, was surely one of the game's greatest-ever seasons. Random boss spawns meant literally anyone had a chance of grabbing exotic weapons, and it showed how a few wacky items can transform battle royale for the better …",

When a whole new generation of graphics cards is going to drop, it energises the entire PC gaming hardware industry; people are going to upgrade, new laptops will arrive, and companies will refresh their entire PC lineups. It's big. Which is why it was a real shame that the launches of both AMD and Nvidia GPUs this year were such a nightmare. Issues with drivers, hardware, and above all, pricing and availability made it hard to enjoy the thrill of new gaming tech. So, in a mess of a launch, who gets the nominations for the best graphics card of 2025? Well, thankfully the rest of the year took care of the failures of launch time, with all the new GPUs becoming far more affordable and far closer to MSRP (in some cases even below!), and now widely available, too. Just in time for the RAMpocalypse to strike and push prices up on anything that has any little bit of memory inside it. Hint: that means everything.

That's a roguelike, baby, no matter how many old habits FromSoftware plugged into it . To me, a soulslike isn't about how chunky the dodge roll is or whether you have a stamina bar—it's about the slow, tense exploration of a dangerous world. It's about deliberate and hard-won mastery over mechanics and, more to the point: It's about the boss fights, baby. Big, satisfying walls to slam your head against, where the only thing between victory is you and your own personal skill, not whether you got Let Me Solo Her in your fireteam or lucked into a busted build.

Loot is king in PoE 2, as it is in any other action RPG, but it's also apparently optional if you're playing a monk with the power to shock bosses in one swift strike. IsfooPoE's build requires nothing but a set of unarmed skills that do a surprising amount of damage without any items to supplement them.

The boss has the power to set the entire room on fire and it still can't land many hits on a dude wearing nothing but a t-shirt and pants.
