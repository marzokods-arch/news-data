So if you tell me it's \"unplayable\" without a fan patch I'm going to do that thing where I raise one eyebrow at you. Did the PC port have problems, though? Oh, hell yes. Cutscenes were wonky as all get-out, with characters not appearing where they were supposed to (if at all), and sometimes sliding into or out of frame as if they were on rollerskates. Cutscene audio often crackled, making dialogue sound cheap and staticky. There were graphical problems too, with resolution options I would charitably call \"limited\" and water that turned black at a distance. It wasn't a great port, it was just a great enough game that I could overlook those and other flaws. There have been multiple attempts to improve Saints Row 2's PC port over the years, and the latest is the most impressive. Called Saints Row 2 Juiced, it fixes all the problems I mentioned in the previous paragraph and more. For example, it adds more than 30 animations that were included in console versions but not on PC, which will make you look much cooler while you're shooting a minigun or running with the rocket launcher equipped.

This early Silksong champion is CrankyTemplar on YouTube, who also appears to have done a lot of Hollow Knight 1 challenge content previously. CrankyTemplar uploaded a first no-hit compilation of Silksong's early bosses the day it came out, releasing subsequent addendums over the following days. CrankyTemplar put out a crowning, nearly two hour-long supercut of beating every boss without taking damage on Thursday, September 11⁠—exactly one week after the game released. For a game widely agreed to be extremely challenging, one that PCG contributor Tyler Colp called \"worth the pain\" in his 90% review of Silksong , I find this to be a staggering accomplishment for how quickly CrankyTemplar managed it. With Silksong being such a massive game, CrankyTemplar does caveat that this \"should\" be every boss in the game, but the list looks exhaustive to me: They even…",

    "body": "Netflix has released a \"first clip\" of Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher Season Four, as distinct from the \"first look\" we got back in May . This is our first actual scene from the season and not a little teaser, though, with Hemsworth sporting the white locks and leather armor of everyone's favorite mutant monster slayer. The clip shows Geralt, an elf, and a dwarf squaring off with a wraith in a dark forest. Dialogue-wise, we just get a little of that Witcher pre-fight monster explaining, the sort of thing Geralt would mutter while looking at clues, but Hemsworth hits the right notes with a similar growl to original Geralt actor Henry Cavill. The choreography of the fight is also physical and legible in a way I dig: Not so many cuts that you can't tell what the hell's going on, and some actually interesting flow to it. The fight's dominated by the specter knocking Geralt over and trying to drag him back to its crypt, before he jams his sword in the ground to slow it and then Aards his way to freedom.

It peaked at over 30,000 concurrent players on Steam and even popped into the top 10 on the top sellers chart . In response to a successful launch weekend, developer Lizard Smoothie released a hotfix to address some early complaints players had, mainly around balancing and progression. Lizard Smoothie co-founder and CEO Eunsop Shim commented on the hotfix and hinted at future updates in a press release. \"Many fans have been with us since the release of our demo, and we want to continue to deliver an experience worthy of their passion and support,\" said Shim. \"Our team also has plans for more updates, improvements and new content in Shape of Dreams. Please look forward to announcements from us in the future!\" Shape of Dreams supports singleplayer or co-op for teams of up to four while blending MOBA and roguelike mechanics.

I left my previous Silksong skepticism in the bin pretty much the second I started playing, but it was stumbling across Sherma tapping his wee bell and singing to a gate to make it open that really sent me over the edge. Like Boc the Seamster in Elden Ring, a lovable, innocent, helpless character only becomes more striking and memorable in the midst of such a hostile, cruel world.

It really peaked in 1996, when Tim Burton and Jonathan Gems created Mars Attacks!, a B-movie pastiche based on the ancient TCG. OK, maybe I'm rewriting history a wee bit here. Mars Attacks! largely bombed, likely not helped by the fact that it launched in the same year as Independence Day. But it was fun and weird and probably gave a few people nightmares after it grafted Sarah Jessica Parker's head onto her dog's body. Fast forward three decades and Mars Attacks! doesn't have much of a legacy, despite its exceptional cast—Jack Nicholson, Glen Close, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Michael J Fox, to name but a few—and its cult status. At least until now, because it's finally getting a videogame adaptation, Mars Attracts . Open for business (Image credit: Outlier) Developer Outlier has smartly avoided going down the simplest route that so many adaptations have sauntered down before: a by-the-numbers action game.

I've always thought of them as entirely separate stories, but Quake 2's latest official episodes—the Machine Games-developed Call of The Machine —explicitly connects the two, with the episode's primary antagonist summoning several Shamblers from the first game to attack the player. This overlap serves as the primary inspiration for Call of the Void , a fanmade Quake 2 episode that takes place after Call of The Machine. This episode throws together Quake 1 and 2's menagerie in much more literal fashion, splicing the roster of both games to create an army of monstrous hybrids. The episode consists of five \"huge\" new maps that mix \"new and old scenarios from both franchises\". Whether this means the maps are inspired by or directly based upon levels from the first two Quake games is unclear. What is clear, weirdly for a Quake game, is the plot. The mod's premise sees your character allying with the race of gods that Quake 1 bosses Chton and Shub-Niggurath descended from, after the Strogg took their remains and,…",

And in the increasingly unlikely event that a game doesn't have co-op to begin with, chances are someone will make a version of it that does. Such is the case with Keep Digging , which lifts the premise of DoubleBee's surprise hit A Game About Digging A Hole , er, wholesale, opens up its shovelling shenanigans for up to eight players, then rests its hard hat over its eyes for a wee nap while the cash rolls in. Like DoubleBee's burrowing sim, Keep Digging sees players break ground using basic tools like spades and pickaxes, which they use to unearth valuable ores and treasures. These can be sold to purchase more advanced equipment like dynamite, wire rope, and batteries. I presume the latter are used to power some other excavation device, but the Steam page just reads \"batteries\" so it isn't clear.

No, the reason for their familiarity is far more interesting: a good chunk of the game's score includes rearranged songs from my favourite PC rhythm game. Welcome to Soundtrack Sunday, where a member of the PC Gamer team takes a look at a soundtrack from one of their favourite games—or a broader look at videogame music as a whole—offering a little backstory and recommendations for tracks you should be adding to your playlist. Neowiz is also the studio behind the DJMax series—starting off as an Asia-exclusive online PC game before moseying off to PlayStation for a number of years, finally returning to desktops in 2020's DJMax Respect V. The game's music library is chock full of tracks, from original pieces to collaborations with other games like League of Legends and Tekken. There's K-pop, metal, hip-hop—if there's a song genre, there's a good chance DJMax has a composer for it.…",

BI's biggest and best milsim to date has kept players satisfied for more than a decade, mainly thanks to its thriving and endlessly creative community, though a host of DLC has helped too. If you haven't braved Arma 3's hyper realistic battlefields, now might be the time to do so. The game is currently 90% off, making it cheaper than a cup of coffee. The discount is part of Bohemia Interactive's Steam publisher sale , which has most of the Czech studio's cheaper than usual. Arma 3 for $3 (£2.50) is by far the best deal of the bunch, though. The single-player campaign, which was released over a period of three years, is pretty strong. But really it's the multiplayer where Arma 3 is at. Whether you're playing ops with friends, building your own scenarios, or getting involved with RP servers like Arma life , it has tons of different experiences to offer. If you want to go all-in, you can get Arma 3 plus all its key DLC for less than the RRP of the base game. While most o…",

In addition, the new 'Holding Hands with Mayu' mechanic adds a heartfelt touch, letting you experience the deep bond between the sisters like never before.\" While two later games in the series, Maiden of Black Water and Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, have made it to PC previously, this is the first time one of the well-received original trilogy will be officially represented on our platform of choice.

    "body": "As reported by Automaton , iconic video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series, has recently given his take on the state of videogame music. In an interview with Japanese outlet Real Sound , Uematsu commented on where the industry is now, particularly concern about creative freedom for composers being stifled. \"I won’t go as far as to call it stagnation, but I believe directors and producers hold too much power in their hands even when it comes to the music,\" said Uematsu, according to Automaton's translation. \"Even now, game composers aren’t in a position to speak their opinion freely, and no matter how much musical knowledge or technical skills they possess, they’re still in a position where it’s difficult to speak their mind. \"There are almost no game producers who are well versed in worldwide entertainment and are familiar with a wide variety of musical genres, so anything goes for them as long as you make it sound like a John Williams movie soundtrack.\" Uematsu compared the situation to the game music industry back in the NES era of the 80s. Back then, few composers had their eye on making music for games, but that has changed dramati…",

This season's new team are the Vampires, definitely one for veteran players. Their most powerful skill is Hypnotic Gaze, which lets them strip opponents of their tackle zones and prevent them using skills like block and dodge. It works on a 2+, rather than 3+ under the old rules in Blood Bowl 2, though it's modified by -1 for each marking player. Hypnotic Gaze is a great way of bypassing blockers and busting cages, but it's balanced by the Bloodlust rule. Every bloodsucker has to pass a test before they act, and if they fail they bite someone else on your team—which is why the handful of useful vampire players have to be bulked out with a mob of thralls who exist just to be snacked on. Playing as the Vampires can be infuriating, as a few bad Bloodlust rolls will see you injuring your own players faster than your opponent can (there's no armor roll for your thralls when they get bit). And great as Hypnotic Gaze is, the roll will absolutely fail when you need it most. In the hands of an experienced p…",

Producer Roy Lee didn't reveal much about the film, but hinted at a potentially lengthy wait: \"Well, 'The Long Walk' became a reality because 'BioShock' was delayed for a little bit where we had to do some more script work. And so as the script work is being done, we shot 'The Long Walk,' and [Francis Lawrence] was already committed to doing the next 'Hunger Games' movie. And so it's just waiting for him whenever the 'Hunger Games' is completed, and the script is just being worked on right now.\" Lee was referring to Sunrise on the Reaping, a Hunger Games prequel focusing on Haymitch Abernathy's Games. It began filming this summer and is set to release on November 20, 2026. Francis Lawrence directed all four of the previous Hunger Games films, so it's no surprise he returned for this one.

If you enjoy soulslikes, it's definitely worth giving Fallen Order a try. It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire.

In an interview with MinnMax (via GamesRadar ) Fox was asked by host Ben Hanson what percentage of Sucker Punch devs would be up for making a new Sly Cooper game, to which Fox instantly responded \"ten percent\". Hanson was slightly taken aback, so Fox clarified that \"It's been a l…",

    "body": "While I'm not an enormous wargame fan, Unity of Command is the exception. The original game, which released way back in 2011, boiled down the infamous complexity of the genre into a more accessible turn-based strategy, focussing primarily on tactical manoeuvres and managing supply lines rather than any base building or faffing around with economics. The sequel ingeniously expands and elaborates upon this simple premise, resulting in one of the best strategy games you can play today, and you can get it right now for a tactically sound 85% off. Unity of Command 2 is based upon the same ideas as the original, all about defeating enemy armies using clever positioning and thinking ahead. Your units' attack power is governed not just by their equipment or experience, but their locations relative to the landscape and both friendly and enemy units, as well as their connection to your army's supply lines. Indeed, the supply mechanic sits right at the heart of Unity of Command, dictating your units' ability to function. If an enemy captures one of your supply depots, it will inhibit units' ability to attack and, eventually, move at all. Likewise, if you can sneak behind an enemy frontline a…",

Tainted Grail's unusual world and intriguing questlines more than made up for a few rough edges, as Sam Desatoff explained in his Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon review . \"Every NPC has something worthwhile to contribute, and most of them offer side quests that add new wrinkles to the larger story,\" he wrote back in June. \"They can also be surprisingly funny: you'll help a nobleman fake his death to get out of a loveless marriage, uncover the lair of an undead chef chasing the next great meal, assist a woman who accidentally turned her husband into a pig, and more.\" Questline has updated Tainted Grail sporadically since launch. But the latest patch— v1.1 —is by far the biggest yet. Not only does it squash a vast array of bugs nibbling at the RPG's underbelly, but it also adds several major features and a bunch of new locations for players to explore. The headline update is a New Game Plus mode, which resets the game …",

The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta. In a recent interview with IGN , console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said changes are coming in the final game. \"We definitely reduced the range and overall reduced the power,\" Nickerson said. \"We found out a lot in open beta that it was obviously very strong, just like players said. Really, players ended up just shooting Doritos. Light environments, dark environments—they were just like, ‘Hey, aim at the Dorito.

The shambles goes back to September 9, when the Destiny 2 team announced the return of the Iron Banner PvP mode, \"with new weapons to earn and an incredibly cool new set of armor .\" A couple days later, though, Bungie unveiled the new Iron Banner armor and it was in fact \"reprised\" armor , which is to say a reskin of old armor—and not an especially impressive one in the eyes of Destiny 2 fashionistas.

(Well, except for a lone IGN commenter who says, \"So BF6 is mainly a console game now? Gross.\") How far we've come! And in context, it does sound like the Battlefield 6 devs aim to correct an imbalance, not to disregard the PC version. \"We don't want to, obviously, tear down or destroy any of the legacy that Battlefield has, which is, first, a PC game,\" said senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson, who revealed in the interview that he coined the \"secretly console first\" saying at Ripple Effect. \"But we really have to care about console at the end of the day.\" Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl offered a similar take. \"Obviously, we're still also thinking about PC players, but in the past, frankly, Battlefield was built as a PC game and then…",

Such is the case with Battlefield 6: Technical director Christian Buhl told IGN that Ripple Effect ( formerly DICE LA ) \"did not want leaks,\" but it did want as much feedback from players as possible—and that meant rolling the dice. \"We had, actually, discussions, I think about a year or two ago,\" Buhl said. \"I guess it was maybe about two years ago, about how much we were going to do to prevent leaks versus how much we were going to do to get the game in front of players.

To rectify a few more issues with the remasters of Shadow of Chornobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Prypiat, GSC has just released a 1.3 patch for the entire remastered trilogy . After two months in the oven, 1.3 brings all the stuff you expect: bug fixes, tweaks, curtailed crashes, but most importantly—Shadow of Chornobyl and Clear Sky now both have quick slots, just like Call of Prypiat. This is an incredible day. It's morning in the Zone. If it's been a while since you fired up CoP, those are the slots—bound to F1, F2, F3, and F4—that let you quickly use items in your inventory without having to pull up the whole equipment screen and laboriously sift through everything you're carrying. By default, they're set to use stuff like medkits, bandages, food, but you can drag whatever you like in there. It's a small quality-of-life feature, but its absence made SoC and CS just that little harder to go back to in the modern era, and having it across the trilogy is an unalloyed good. T…",

It's not exactly been smooth sailing for 2K Games and Gearbox Software, the publishers and developers, as the game's overall performance is rougher than the Drake Passage. To help matters (or make things worse, depending on your point of view), 2K produced a detailed chart of what settings Nvidia GPU owners should use to get the best performance. However, most of this just involved enabling upscaling and frame generation. Borderlands 4 is just plain hard on your hardware. Especially the CPU, it would seem, because the minimum system requirements demand an '8 core (or equivalent)' processor, citing an Intel Core i7 9700 as an example. Yesterday, I tested a very similar chip , the 9700K, in a rig with a Radeon RX 5700 XT and 1080p Low quality, and the CPU was frequently hitting 100% utilisation in the open world (see below). But what if your gaming PC has a processor with fewer cores, a Core i5 or a Ryzen 5 chip, for example? Does that mean you're going to be in trouble? To find out, I've spent the day running a series of tests on two gaming PCs, where I've decreased the num…",

Balatro creator LocalThunk announced the delay today, and offered a relatable excuse: \"I'm slow.\" After apologizing for the delay, LocalThunk said he probably shouldn't have announced a release target for the 1.1 update in the first place: He's a \"hobbyist developer at heart,\" who unfortunately became \"all too familiar with the crunch and stress that inherently come with professional game development\" following the launch of Balatro in 2023. By the time the mobile edition of Balatro launched in late 2024, he was \"well and truly burned out.\" \"I took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025 when I very slowly eased myself back into the work,\" LocalThunk wrote. \"However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist (a few hours per day, and not always on the 1.1 update), and it turns out that it’s a lot slower than working in cru…",

You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay. It was kinda fun: I played a few runs, unlocked some upgrades, and experienced brief whiplash after locking eyes with two headlines about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real.

One early game location is called \"Embracer's Bluff\", a run-down place crammed with garbage and containing two rather pointed side quests. The first involves a murderous vending machine that kills a would-be customer, while the second is centred on a talking AI-powered toilet that everyone hates.

To be honest, it's probably still a reasonably decent CPU in many scenarios, but you can't deny that this sort of rebranding makes things even more complicated for your average user trying to decide on their next upgrade. That's not to mention that the Core i5 110 is an LGA 1200 socket chip, which is a whole two generations behind.
