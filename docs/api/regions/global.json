It's not like I need an excuse to play, but running through Nightlords and Everdark Sovereigns was starting to get tedious. I wanted a new challenge, and what better than a ranked \"endless mode\"? Deep of Night isn't endless in the sense that you just keep going day after day until you die, but it is endless in the sense that you rank up or down depending on whether you win a run, and then your progress affects your rank, which you can keep working towards. (Image credit: FromSoftware) It's largely more of the same, with the two-day expedition followed by Nightlord finale, the same maps, and the same kinds of enemies that inhabit them. The main differences lie in how strong these enemies can get and what kind of weapons you can find around the map. Not only do the regular grunts hit harder now, but there are souped-up versions of enemies called mutants with a bloody-red tinge to them. They're yet another step up from what players are used to, but fighting them is worth it because of what they drop: weapons with additional and more powerful effects. I pic…",

But well before Moneyball grew notoriety, videogames had been reducing sports to their starkest numbers: and in 1992, developers Paul and Oliver Collyer released their calculating, statistic-obsessed vision of the beautiful game. The first Championship Manager wasn't a hit, but it wasn't a flop either, and follow-up Championship Manager 93 made several improvements. The Collyer brothers founded Sports Interactive in July 1994, to develop and manage what was becoming a (relative) sales success, but the game had one core piece of magic.

Oddly enough, Harlowe feels the most like the traditional Siren we've come to know, more so than the best Vex builds , despite her reliance on tech. Nevertheless, the Gravitar brings much more to the table than you'd initially expect, so I'll go over three of the best Harlowe builds at max level below.

Unfortunately, you're restrained by how many skill points you can earn, which is based on the current max level , so you can't splash the cash and unlock every power. Below, I'll go over the max level in Borderlands 4 and how many skill points you can expect to earn right now, so you can properly plan out your characters ' builds. However, I'll also discuss whether we can expect this to increase in the future. What is the max level in Borderlands 4? The max level in Borderlands 4 is 50 , giving you a total of 49 skill points to spend across your three skill trees. Every five skill points you spend unlocks the next layer of the skill tree, apart from the final tier, which requires an extra point to get the final perk. In other words, you could almost reach the end of two skill trees if you're being efficient, though that's not really optimal for most builds. There are a few key features related to your progression: You'll start encountering loot drops with Firmware as early as level 25 (these are effectively gear sets).

Real wood. You know you've made it when your PC case was once alive. Each of the slats over the front intake on the PA401 is made from (sustainably sourced) ash with a glossy finish. So glossy, in fact, the grain is far less noticeable compared to the Fractal Design Terra or North. It's almost indistinguishable from plastic unless you're right up to it. Personally, I like it. The understated wood effect fits with the diminutive design across the rest of the case. But other members of the PC Gamer team thought it needed a little more pizazz. Altogether a simple case to build into, the ProArt stands out for the smaller details.

My health bar wasn't as big as it could've been, as I was only level 12 at the time and hadn't picked tons of HP buff effects, but the Night Tide still took a fifth of my health off in a matter of seconds. To make matters worse, on my second trip back into the Night Tide to go get my lost runes, I decided to overshoot and go to a Site of Grace…",

For which we all played our tiny violins, I'm sure. Anyway, Oracle's share price dipped slightly by the end of the day, putting Musk back at the top once more. I'm not sure what happens when you receive the title back—I like to think trumpets herald a messenger carrying your new, gold-plated, diamond-encrusted plaque—but regardless, Musk has reclaimed the position, despite a year where his Tesla-enhanced fortunes have experienced the odd wobble or two . The Oracle/OpenAI deal is said to be one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed, which is quite an impressive feat given just how much money is being funneled into AI computing in the metaphorical skies. The contract is said to begin in 2027, and looks to represent something of a risk for both companies, given OpenAI's massive operating…",

Its first expansion—Claws of Awaji—is due out on September 16, and to lay the groundwork, the studio put out a big ol' 1.1.1 update for the game today. There's actually a whole bunch of stuff in this one. The level cap continues its inexorable crawl upwards (it's 100 now), you can now advance the time of day at-will once you have a certain hideout upgrade, and scouts have gotten better—upgrade them enough and they'll be able to spot viewpoints and safehouses when you dispatch them to foggy areas on the map.

That means that it can be installed via the normal Windows Update latest cumulative updates (LCUs). So, it can be downloaded and installed in the background with its various component parts disabled, until the entirely of 25H2 has been acquired.

    "body": "I'd never heard of LiberNovo until I started seeing a flood of ads on my Instagram for its new chair blowing up on Kickstarter: over $7 million raised and counting. As a gamer, I'm used to seeing flashy chairs from the usual suspects, but this was something different enough to grab my attention. And honestly, as someone who's getting on in years and feeling the toll of endless hours at a desk, I'm always on the hunt for anything that might make those marathon computer sessions a little less punishing on my back. Enter the LiberNovo Omni : apparently the world's first dynamic ergonomic chair that promises real-time spine support, motorized lumbar adjustment, four distinct recline positions, and even a built-in spinal stretch massage. The idea of a chair that could actually adapt to how I sit—rather than forcing me into its own mold—was enough to make me take a closer look. But is it the revelation we've been waiting for, or just a flashy Kickstarter moonshot with a few too many moving parts? Unboxing the Omni, I immediately notice its sci-fi vibe. The back support bar looks like it belongs in a spaceship cockpit, and the seat cushion is plush but breathable—think memory foam with a…",

Silk and Soul is pretty painless as quests go, unless you haven't beaten Groal the Great, in which case, forget everything I said—it's extremely painful, though more on that in the Seeker Soul section.

Some say you have to do every quest or find every lost flea, but I'm here to get rid of any misconceptions. Since I didn't do loads of side content, it wasn't actually too hard to pin down the unlock conditions for the Silk and Soul quest you need to complete to open up Act 3.

In a recent video (via Techeblog ), it's shown forehanding, backhanding, and smashing ping pong balls with impressive dexterity and, dare I say it, human- like movement. What's so visually impressive about it, at least to my eyes, is how it keeps balance and makes quick decisions and very human-like arm and leg movements. In particular, as someone who used to play a lot of table tennis and who wasn't awful at it, I was genuinely impressed by how HITTER returns smashes, and also with the return at 0:28 right off the edge of the table.

Taking two hits of damage rather than the one we were used to in Hollow Knight (since it was so rare for an enemy to inflict two) has certainly been a learning curve for a lot of people. But that hasn't stopped the usual suspects declaring that the game isn't difficult and those struggling simply need to \"get good\". If you fall among this crowd, I applaud you and just know every time I run back to the Savage Beastfly arena I'm struck with a pang of jealousy. But if you're (somehow) finding the game too easy, fret not. There's now a mod that allows you to increase the double damage caused by some enemies to triple. The 'No Double Damage' mod created by TheLima does exactly what it says on the tin, but not in the way you'd think. It's easy to assume this title means the mod will take you back to a time where enemies would only cause you one hit of damage since it markets itself on simply removing double damage.…",

It also lets you insult someone so hard that they just die, which is also the case in Baldur's Gate 3 . Larian went real overboard on the depth and breadth of insults with this singular cantrip—even giving one NPC bespoke, trauma-invoking dunks just to twist the knife even more. But there was a time when these insults were just plain dookie. No, literally.

To be quite frank, if this was a new x86 CPU for gaming PCs, we'd be losing our minds. The A19 Pro is scoring nearly 4,000 points in Geekbench 6's single-thread test. That compares with about 3,500 for the best AMD desktop CPU . And may I remind you, that's in a freaking phone. The A19 Pro in a desktop with the power budget and thermals that affords would be higher still, well over 4,000. If a new AMD or Intel CPU popped up in Geekbench hitting, say, 4,500, the internet would just about break. And to be clear, these Geekbench numbers for the A19 Pro are plausible. The previous-gen A18 Pro scores around 3,500 points in Geekbench 6. So, a 15% boost to 4,000 points for the latest chip fitted to a phone with a new vapor chamber cooling system doesn't seem like a massive stretch. Of course, Geekbench is hardly the perfect benchmark. And it's demonstrably not a game. But comparative real-world performance in applications doesn't tend to be a million miles away from Geekbench.

It's absurd but deeply satisfying, and after all, you are a hyper-borged-up death machine by that point in the story. You know who's not a hyper-borged-up death machine? Henry of Skalitz, lovable medieval yokel and protagonist of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (and 1, for that matter), which makes it all the more impressive that the game's recent 1.4 patch snuck in a new secret ending (via GamesRadar ) for those players who manage to single-handedly annihilate an entire enemy army. Uncovered by an industrious Redditor , the new ending can be found in the quest called The Lion's Den. That'd be the one where Henry infiltrates the camp of King Sigismund's army and solves a murder: heavy on sneaking about, investigation, and social skills. Unless you're cool, that is. In which case, you stroll into camp, draw your sword, and promptly massacre like a billion enemy soldiers. Make your way through enough of them, and you'll eventually hit a new endgame screen, reading \"You changed history! Sigismund lost his army and returned to Hungary in disgrace.\" You see? Indiv…",

So, plenty of new content to really sink your teeth into. In addition, this update also sees the addition of creative mode and custom world settings which let you fine-tune your experience by tweaking things like hunger and thirst rates, and making your world unique to you. When the 0.9 update was originally announced via the Dragonwilds blog , the full extent of world customisation sliders was briefly shown off, and let me tell you, there are far more options than I was expecting.

To help you make that all-important decision, I'll give you an overview of each Vault Hunter and their three broad playstyles. However, I'd be foolish not to note that the 'meta' doesn't really matter in Borderlands, so pick whichever character you think looks the coolest. Plus, Borderlands 4 finally lets you skip the campaign on alternate characters, so it's easier than ever to try out all the Vault Hunters. Who's the best character in Borderlands 4? If I had to pick just one, the best character in Borderlands 4 is Rafa , primarily due to his incredible ability to buff his gun damage across both his Remote Agent and People Person skill trees.

It's made by the same devs (Crowbar Collective) who managed to pull off the Half-Life remake Black Mesa , so my hopes were high from the start. The vision for Rogue Point is simple: make a co-op shooter that actually requires players to be cooperative—groundbreaking, I know.

Darrah's first video covered Anthem's earliest years and the issues with its initial conception that he said echoed through the duration of its development. This second chapter is a meaty one, because it begins in 2017: the year that Darrah took over as the project's executive producer, and a time when he said Anthem \"had developed this highly dysfunctional relationship with decision-making.\" (Image credit: EA) In the years following Mass Effect creator and original Anthem creative director Casey Hudson's departure from BioWare, Darrah said that Anthem wallowed without a clear direction.
