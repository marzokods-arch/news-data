According to Schafer, whose acclaimed adventure game studio was acquired by Microsoft in 2019, Spencer and the software giant have been true to their word, at least in his experience. \"When we talked about becoming acquired, it was a big thing for me, like, 'How do we keep our culture intact?'\" Schafer said. \"And everyone was like, 'No, we really want you to stay who you are.'

In well over 60 hours of Battlefield 6, I've had just a handful of excursions in the The Light Ground Transport (or LGT) that didn't leave me riddled with bullets or suddenly exploded. It is so bad at its one job—safely transporting—that it's not unusual to watch your team ignore a fleet of free jeeps and choose to hoof it across the map instead. The LGT is a failure. The Traverser Mark 2 , a new armored transport truck arriving in Battlefield 6 Season 1 , is its redemption. I took the Traverser for a handful of test drives during a preview session on the upcoming maps Eastwood and Blackwell Fields , and much like the maps themselves, I came away unable to imagine Battlefield 6 without it. The Traverser is the LGT's bigger, stronger, and meaner sibling. It seats just four total, so one less than the LGT, but it's also packing three times the fire…",

CS2's wacky economy has certain constants, and one of those is that the super-rare and most valuable items are knives and to a lesser extent gloves. The price for a unique gun skin may well shoot into the stratosphere but, generally speaking, knives are the most sought-after commodity in the CS2 skin game. And until this update, you could only get a knife by either getting lucky when opening a case (with miniscule chances), or by straight-up buying one on the Steam community market.

The Hades Reddit was flooded with threads discussing problems with how the story wraps up, so much so that the moderators asked users to only use neutral statements about it in their thread titles to avoid any hint of spoilers for those who hadn't seen it yet. Without spoiling anything here myself, I'll just say the main issue seemed to be about how abrupt it felt and that certain characters behaved in a way that didn't line up with the rest of the story. Basically, Hades 2 had a surprisingly tidy ending for a story about messy gods. The negative reactions must've been strong enough to prompt developer Supergiant Games to start working on a way to contextualize—not change—the ending. In its first patch since its release, Hades 2 will get \"true ending enhancements\" that add new events that lead up to it and a few following i…",

Hell yes. \"They’ll be the first-ever screen adaptations of the global phenomenon,\" Netflix said, \"in which settlers navigate vast landscapes, forge shifting alliances, and compete for scarce resources as robbers roam the island.\" Vast landscapes? Shifting alliances? That's pretty dramatic talk for a game where people primarily trade wheat for wool and carefully lay out roads on a hex grid, isn't it?

Sadly, that's not how it works, and you won't find that peace in DVD Bounce World .

While some game industry CEOs see the rise of AI as an imminent revolution in revenue-generation (and yeah, sure, creativity and whatnot), Zelnick has always been a bit cooler on it: \" Genius is the domain of human beings ,\" he said in May 2023, \"and I believe will stay that way.\" And so he was today, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in Menlo Park, California, where he said that the use of AI will \"probably be able to create a bunch of efficiency\" for game studios, but won't produce any hit games because it can't actually be creative. \"What AI is, is the combination of big datasets with a bunch of compute within natural LLM—a large language model,\" Zelnick told his audience. Leaning into an opinion he shared in an interview earlier this year , he continued, \"And by definition, a data set is what? Backward looking. By definition, creativity is what? Forward looking. And to the extent that AI appears to be forward looking, it is what? A predictive model.\" This, he continued, is where the wh…",

But this time it \"just kind of felt right,\" Roberts says. In the Keepers of the Flame expansion, which arrives on October 31, PoE will return to Breach, a nine-year-old mechanic that is basically about killing monsters in a circle until time runs out. The simplicity of Breach will stay. Roberts stresses that the team wanted to be extremely careful about adding unnecessary complexity that might alienate its long-time fans. It will still involve touching a creepy hand and killing monsters inside of an expanding circle, but those monsters will have improved behavior thanks to tech that was worked on for the last Path of Exile 2 patch . And now there will be \"unstable\" breaches which call in a new boss to cap off the event.

Enter the Raiju V3 Pro , another wireless controller pitched towards the Esports scene but instead featuring symmetrical TMR sticks and PlayStation stylings. All for $220, which is $20 more than the latest iteration of the Wolverine. Sorry, what ? The TMR sticks contribute in part to that steep premium. For those unaware, the Hall effect is one magnetic tech that effectively banishes stick drift, and TMR (or tunnelling magnetoresistance) is another. The difference is that the way TMR leverages its electromagnetic sensors allows the controller's sticks to pick up really minute movements, making for a level of precision above even what the Hall effect can offer. Oh, and on the Raiju V3 Pro, you can swap in a long, long thumbstick topper for even more precise movement if that's your jam (though I'm not sure it's mine).

Per analyst firm Circana (via Gamesindustry.biz ), Borderlands 4 has Gearbox counting stacks for the foreseeable future: It was the number one US best-seller for the month of September (August 31 to October 3, to be specific). Not just that, but it's sold 30% more than Borderlands 3's debut, and stands as the fastest-selling game in the franchise's history. Exactly how many stacks is a different ballgame. Borderlands 4, according to Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, had more than twice the budget of Borderlands 3 (assuming he wasn't just being hyperbolic, which is always possible ). Whether or not these nippy sales are enough to categorise it as an unmitigated success for Pitchford are entirely dependent on what his studio's goals are. Also raising eyebrows are the fact that Borderlands 4 went on sale earlier this month. Past the cutoff point for Circana's data, mind, but given Pitchford's past words warn…",

The woman is speaking to the man. The man is holding a controller and wearing a gaming headset. The man reaches for his headset to turn on Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). The audio of the woman's voice ceases and the man continues to play his game. The next shot is the same pair walking down a corridor, once again the woman's voice is mostly muted.

It works with and is at least in part designed for use with the PS5, of course, but also for PC. In fact, on PC it reaches up to 2,000 Hz polling, which is twice what you get with the Wolverine V3 Pro, but obviously less than what you get on the 8,000 Hz Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC.

I've been equally impressed by the new players that've filled out said number—including Whitney Moore, who plays Tyranny. In case you're not caught up, I'll give you the broad strokes: Tyranny's a demon, who the Church of the Candescent Creed have taken on along with a host of infernal (or abyssal, I'm not sure what Brennan's hell lore is like yet) siblings. On the outside, she's being taught by Sam Riegel's character how to be pious and virtuous. It's already an excellent mechanic, with Riegel's Wicander Halovar playing the straight man to Tyranny's messy antics. At least, on first blush: In a recent interview with Moore by Wargamer 's Mollie Russell, she confesses that she's bitten off a bit more than she could chew. \"Sam Riegel and I are a duo, and I made the mistake of thinking that I could out-troll him, so now we're in a race to the bottom to see who can be the voice of reason first.\" That tracks.

    "body": "Well, damn. The novelty of a brand new Star Trek: Voyager game tricked me into setting aside my natural cynicism, and I got burned. Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown, I'm sad to report, is about as tasty as Neelix's cooking. A budget survival game that commits the worst sin: it's just so bloody dull. On paper, Voyager and the survival management genre is a perfect marriage. One of those couples who go all the way, right into the coffin. A crew lost on the other side of the galaxy, pursued by threats that include the Borg Collective, unable to get any assistance from daddy Starfleet. It's a good fit. (Image credit: Daedalic) But while Across the Unknown's Steam demo technically has all the elements of a solid survival game and a good Voyager adaptation—scrabbling for resources, repairing and upgrading the ship, sending away teams into dangerous situations—it's largely devoid of any excitement or drama. Everything mostly plays out in text, accompanied by sparse art that's generally serviceable but sometimes rather poor, and basic, dead-eyed character models. While the dialogue broadly captures the vibe of each crew member, it feels more like I'm playing with an off-brand crew …",

Thing is, I'm a total sucker for that kind of stuff: neon lights in a nighttime cityscape, angular 80s cars modified out the wazoo cruising through the streets while breakbeat floods my ears. It's top-tier vibes, and Screamer is promising to serve up plenty of that even from just the small snippet I checked out. (Image credit: Milestone S.r.l.) Admittedly, I never played the original Screamer nor its sequel. In my defence I was approximately three entire weeks old when the first one came out. Not quite in keyboard-and-mouse territory with my tiny little fingers at that point in time. But if you were one of those OG Screamer (or Screamer 2) enjoyers, I'd recommend treating this new entry as something entirely different.

Deus Ex: Human Revolution was set in 2027; we simply cannot almost be there in real life. Ahem. The good news is that that 'release window' is set to become a 'release date' imminently. Mouse's date is set to hit literally today, as part of the ongoing Galaxies Gaming Showcase. It'll just be a date in 2026 rather than 2025, now. If you've not been keeping track, Mouse is a good ol'-fashioned FPS in a good ol'-fashioned style. Literally. The game's done up like Steamboat Willy—a black-and-white, cartoon-ified world filled with '20s gangster-rodents for you to tommy-gun your way through.

One blocker to that might be hesitation over the new bespoke version of Windows running on the handheld. However, it turns out the handheld can run Bazzite—a Linux OS extremely similar to SteamOS—and doing so actually improves performance. That's going by tech YouTuber Cyber Dopamine's ad-hoc testing (via Tom's Hardware ). They got Bazzite up and running and spoke to one of the operating system's devs who ironed out any bugs and got the OS running well on the ROG Xbox Ally X. The end result is an ROG Xbox Ally X that seems to offer a better handheld gaming experience, though only in the games that actually work on Linux, of course. Bazzite isn't SteamOS, but it runs Steam's Big Picture Mode on top of a custom Fedora Linux distribution, and looks and runs essentially the same as SteamOS, with some extra options and so on. That in itself is a point in its favour, by my books, because SteamOS is very simple to use—it's one of the reasons I rate the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS so highly.

Players didn't like how currency gain slowed to a crawl (that has since been fixed ) and server woes were widely reported. But one of the enduring complaints about Siege X is that the shift to free-to-play has triggered a huge uptick in cheating. I caught up with Siege creative director Alexander Karpazis at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week. I asked if the team at Ubisoft Montreal expected cheating to surge to the extent that it did in June. \"We knew having free access that it could be a vector that is exploited,\" he said, \"and we were ramping up our R6 ShieldGuard. In a lot of ways it really did help, but we need to be faster when it comes to making sure that we stay one step ahead of cheat makers, too.\" Eliminating cheating entirely is impossible, I acknowledged, and Karpazis agreed. \"Absolutely. That's a message that we keep on having to share with our community. It's not something where we'll receive zero percent cheating. \"But there is a goal for us to make sure that, again, if we stay ahead of cheating and we address it fas…",

He listed Tekken 1-5 as his \"most hated\" games and had public \"feuds\" with Tekken's Katsuhiro Harada and Devil May Cry's Hideki Kamiya. While working on 2005's Ninja Gaiden Black, he said that Devil May Cry 3 director Hideaki Itsuno—who went on to make DMC 4, 5, and Dragon's Dogma—\"did pretty well for a young guy\" and \"might make something even better next time.\" Behind the blustery facade, Itagaki seemingly respected his action game peers a great deal; roasting them was his way of projecting the image of a true Master Ninja. But as I tried to convey in my Ninja Gaiden 4 review , Itagaki's games were different from the ones his competitors were making. It wasn't just that they tended to be more challenging, but that they took themselves so seriously; the winking tone that Kamiya favored with DMC's Dante and later Bayonetta were nowhere to be found in Itagaki's games. His sense of humor was adding an easier \"Ninja Dog\" mode to Ninja Gaiden for players who died too many times on the first level. The most cosmically strange thing about Ninja Gaiden 4…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Steam reviews are an endless source of both information and amusement. Where else can you read a review from someone who has played a survival game for 35,000 hours before giving it a thumbs-down ? Or, for that matter, find a glowing review of an MMO someone has played for less than an hour? But the best Steam reviews, for my money, are the ones where a player hammers out a review that encapsulates an entire game in just a few words, like the one in the image above by Steam user \"Cyber Lesbian\" for Marvel Rivals. Short reviews are like mini-poems, really, and even when they're silly they can still tell you a lot about game. I put a quiz together a few weeks ago to challenge you to identify 10 games based only on a blurb from a Steam review . It went over well, so we're doing it again! In the quiz below, see if you can guess the game based on a short Steam review . And let us know how you scored in the comments: overwhelmingly positive, or mostly negative?",
