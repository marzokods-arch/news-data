For Paradox Tinto, good design comes with a bit of democracy. \"Design documents stifle creativity and it reduces people's ownership and empowerment,\" Andersson said. \"You create better games by talking with your team … tell the person some broad outlines, like 'we want this,' 'it should function like this,' a few samples, and let them make the detailed decisions. It creates greater ownership and greater accountability long-term in a project. Otherwise, you end up with a bunch of idea guys who write all the documents and the rest are there to follow. …",

    "body": "As reported by Automaton , actor and model Konatsu Kato, who provided the likeness and Japanese voice of Silent Hill f protagonist Shimizu Hinako, has begun streaming her first playthrough of the game , fulfilling a promise she made earlier this month on X (formerly Twitter) . Kato has so far streamed once on YouTube, playing through the early portions of Silent Hill f and leaving a nearly two-hour VOD that's racked up over 1.6 million views at the time of writing. Kato and her commenters speak Japanese, and I didn't feel like I'd get anything worthwhile out of YouTube's auto-translation feature (which presumably draws from already-garbled auto-generated captions), but there's a universal language of horror at work here that makes the stream very easy to follow regardless. Whether Kato's pulling away from the screen in a tense moment, mimicking her character's actions in real life, or struggling to line up a fiddly action button prompt during a chase sequence, we've all been there playing a horror game. One great moment I particularly empathized with was when Kato relaxed during a long cutscene, only to have to scramble to attention when it surprise transitioned back to gameplay. …",

And while it's nice to know Boltgun 2 is in development, it's nicer to know a bit about what it will actually contain. The latest trailer does just that, by informing us that Boltgun 2 will let us choose a second playable character. That character being Nyra Veyrath, a Celestian of the Sisters of Battle, to be specific. She wields a bolt pistol/power sword combo, switching to a meltagun or flamer when the enemies of the Imperium need a good superheating, and has some good mobility, with a slide move I couldn't imagine the bulky space marine Malum Caedo pulling off. As well as letting us choose between two protagonists, Boltgun 2 will have a branching campaign, with different decisions leading you through different levels. It'll also have more biomes than the first game, including a jungle swamp and a hive city to fight through. Looks like there's an ice world too? I just hope I don't get lost in the levels as often as I did in the original. Boltgun 2 will be out in 2026, and available on Steam . I'm sure the internet will be completely normal abou…",

It won him over, though, as he said his impressions: \"Under its deceptive meme game veneer, Escape From Duckov is an excellent topdown shooter that smartly repackages the extraction shooter in a satisfying singleplayer format.\" Singleplayer extraction shooter might sound like a bit of an oxymoron—the genre is all about evading other players to escape with your life and loot—but Duckov is stuffed with all sorts of quests and a base to kit out with upgrades, essentially squeezing the genre into the framework of a roguelite RPG.

Europa Universalis 2, for instance, was conceived under brutal time constraints. Andersson explained, \"We came up with a bunch of ideas for what we should be doing. I think we, in two or three meetings, wrote down, like, three pages of ideas, and it's 'Okay, we need to get this game out quickly, and it needs to be done so it's sold in the US market before Christmas, because we need the money [or] else we cannot pay people.'\" That didn't curb the team's ambitions, mind you. Players had already tinkered with EU1—wherein you selected from a small batch of scenarios, each with a designated playable nation—to make any country accessible from the get. The mod maker behind that feature, named Henrik Fåhraeus, was hired as content designer for the sequel, which aimed to have every country playable in the base game; today, Fåhraeus is Paradox's chief creative officer. \"So, that's a good hire.

A life bar rapidly depletes as you idle or miss a bug for too long, and your score suffers if you accidentally hit one of your fellow Helldivers, who pop up from time to time.

But before it had solidified that reputation, it was trying to make a name in other genres. Trying, and failing spectacularly. In an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens , Andersson recalled one of the studio's earliest games: \"If you want to laugh, Google Valhalla Chronicles. We had the best comment ever on that one: 'bugs, many and diverse, some more interesting than the gameplay.'\" It's not a looker. But as Andersson explained, the team was \"doing multiple games at the same time\" and its take on a Baldur's Gate-inspired RPG \"did not turn out great. \"We did a lot of games with a small team of like five, six people for the first, like 10 years,\" he said. \"We became Paradox in 1999 and Paradox Interactive in 2005. Until 2009, I think we released like 20 different games from that internal studio, and most of them were grand strategy games.\" While strategy was clearly the studio's wheelhouse, it didn't become obvious until much later that it'd be…",

No videogame genre has birthed more bangers than the humble JRPG. I mean, come on, can you even imagine a world where a track like One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy 7 doesn't exist? Or where we never got to hear a real monk chanting absolute bars over Metaphor: ReFantazio's orchestral battle theme? A timeline where we never get to experience the delicate piano of Kingdom Hearts' Dearly Beloved washing over us when booting up the game? I certainly can't, which is why I maintain that JRPG music is some of the best in the biz. It kind of has to be, really. Not only will they probably be some of the longest videogames you ever play—hello to my triple-digit Persona 5 Royal playtime—but they'll also probably take you through every feeling you could ever experience.

From the first moment you step foot on Paradise Island, you'll start discovering all sorts of strange murder contraptions, from a sniper rifle that fires sneaky explosive bolts you detonate when you reload, to a pistol that infects enemies with a contagious disease they can spread. The strangest weapon by far that I've discovered in my travels through Arcadia, though, is a sword that turns combat into a rhythm game. Yes, you read that correctly—if you don't slash and slice to the old timey beat, you won't gain its bonus. This sword might seem like a bit of a meme at first, but when fully powered up, I'm convinced it might be the best melee weapon in the game. The Spectrum Dance Saber, as it's called, is quite hard to get. You'll first have to complete an elaborate collectible quest to unlock it, and even then it'll set you back 16,500 bits , making it by far the most expensive weapon I've found in the game. Even after unscrupulously looting my way across the first few regions, this still put a serious dent in my hoard of bits.

Before it shut down in 2022 , it was a relic of a time when MOBAs hadn't really proved their staying power yet; and now, somehow, it's back. First announced nine months ago , Heroes of Newerth: Reborn is a relaunch-slash-remaster of the defunct MOBA. A trailer dropped Wednesday announcing a free open beta starting on Nov. 11, and it certainly looks like HoN. While League of Legends was a fully original game with its own heroes and items, HoN was much closer to DotA (albeit with a trashier sense of humor). In May 2010, Dota was still just an old Warcraft 3 mod, so HoN had its niche among players who didn't like League's snappier, skill shot-oriented action. All this makes the re-release sort of a headscratcher for any outside of Newerth's niche fanbase.

This fancy dome-protector is relatively tough to acquire and you'll miss it entirely (along with a bunch of other strange gear) if you don't complete a specific collectible quest. It's well worth it, though, for its defining feature: it changes the visual style of the game entirely. At first, I thought it was just a helmet, but when I whacked it on I realised the game now had arcade-st…",

In a post on X , Griesemer reposted gameplay footage saying, \"You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot.\" Tagging Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto, he added, \"What have they done to beloved B30?!\" You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters.

It's an evolution of the Telltale style—from Telltale vets unsurprisingly—that tightens up the format and shakes off some cobwebs.

But that gives it an appropriately brisk pace and kinetic energy that I'm finding pretty damn refreshing. (Image credit: AdHoc Studio) But when I realised it was going to be an episodic deal, I scoffed. An episodic game? In the year of our lord 2025? In the 2010s, when Telltale started releasing all of its games episodically, it was novel. It was also before streamers took over TV and dumped entire seasons on us instantly. Now the streamers have started to go back to traditional release schedules, but it still seemed wrong to have to wait to enjoy more of a game. It's finished. It's ready.

It's the best because it has thread titles like \"My son became a German and now my empire is dying\", constant grousing about whatever the Pope's getting up to, and endless hand-rubbing about what to do (or what not to do) with wives, heirs, and all those vassals any self-respecting Crusader King collects. This week's quiz is a simple one. There are 15 thread titles here. To prove your worth, separate the real from the made up. One note: Kwizly has a hint system that doesn't work very well with yes/no quizzes like this.

We had to patch the game to allow him to play more, because the number just couldn't go up. Then we started counting, like, he must have played almost every waking hour since the game launched to be able to hit that number.\" So yeah, Vermintide and its 2018 sequel have some devoted players, happy to rinse the games in perpetuity as they work their way up the difficulty levels and run maps over and over until they perfect them. In good news for those hardcore 'Tide heads, Fatshark plans to continue support for Vermintide 2, which has already grown so much it barely resembles the game we reviewed seven years ago . On the 10th anniversary of Vermintide, Fatshark revealed its roadmap of plans for Darktide and Vermintide 2 . Both games have months of support sketched out, but what's coming after that? Well, it won't be Vermintide 3. As its design director Joakim Setterberg explains, Vermintide 2 still has a lot of places to go…",

When it comes to any sim willing to pat me on the head with a validating \"good job,\" count me in. I don't know which societal failure to blame for that, but PowerWash Simulator is among the best at it. Every time I finish cleaning a surface, I'm rewarded with a satisfying ding. Sometimes there's a bunch of different dirty surfaces close together, and then I get several dings in quick succession. It's riveting stuff. That was a thing in the first game, but PowerWash Simulator 2 adds a big, circular surface cleaner, the Swirlforce Surf Ace, for maximum good job dings on flat surfaces. It's all the satisfaction and thrill of getting a new kitchen appliance as an adult, but instead of shoving it into a cabinet and forgetting it, I'm driving all over town and looking for excuses to use it.

Turning down the \"world brightness\" in Battlefield 6's graphics menu helps make the game a little easier on the eyeballs, but the update promise of \"improved exposure transitions between indoor and outdoor areas for better visibility\" sounds like a better option. The movement rewo…",

The reception is much less warm on Steam , though, where fewer than half of the current user reviews are positive. Complaints about Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted are many and varied. Three leap out as particularly common—the lack of dynamic music (which the original game had), no online multiplayer, and allegations (unsubstantiated, as far as I know) of AI-generated or upscaled art assets—and as usual, words like \"lazy\" and \"cash grab\" abound. More generally (and thoughtfully), though, there's just a broad sense of dissatisfaction with the remaster's attention to detail. The reaction reflects the risk of remastering a much-loved game like Plants vs. Zombies—and, for those who weren't hip to the scene 16 years ago, PvZ is much loved. It was a genuine sensation when it dropped in 2009, and probably the number-one reason EA bought the high-flying PopCap in 2011 for $750 million , after which it did what it does by laying off a bunch of people, turning t…",

It's, I don't know, Vampire: The Masquerade – Sleepless in Seattle or something. All I know is that it's definitely not Bloodlines, and slapping that name on The Chinese Room's game was a mistake.

It's a great Vampire: The Masquerade game, dripping with atmosphere, vibrating with conspiracies, and hell, the combat can even be pretty fun when you're absolutely clowning on a gaggle of ghouls with your elder vampire abilities. But I say 'it's a great V:TM game' deliberately.

My 8BitDo Retro R8 isn't as competitively viable as the Logitech I swapped it out for, but it is more convenient. The Retro mechanical keyboard doesn't have rapid trigger, but it does have a few programmable keys and a solid feel. The 8BitDo Pro 3 carries on this tradition, but makes a few more compromises than its desk buddies. The controller I've been testing comes in a purple variant, with red and green face buttons, and is very clearly inspired by the Nintendo GameCube. Looking like tech from a few decades ago is sort of 8BitDo's shtick, and 8BitDo does it better than pretty much anyone else. The Pro 3 looks delightful, both on and off its charging stand, and that charging stand adds more than just an ornament to a room. It comes with a compartment underneath to plug in a 2.4 GHz dongle, which means, if you plug the dock into your PC, it will both charge your controller and work as your connector.

With a depth of connectivity options and that look, it already stood out, but $200 is a decent chunk of cash to spend, and we buy tech for more than just the look. And the answer to 'does it sound good?' ends up far more nuanced than I thought it would after my testing. The G2000 Pro's pretty iconic look is both a big positive and a negative. It's true that among your audiophile friends (assuming you have some), this will be one of the most 'out there' set of speakers. They have a radical angular design, plus a ring in the centre of the see-through plastic that is covered in RGB-lit lines. Powering the G2000 Pro on feels like an event in itself, bathing bright colourful lights into the room. It is truly striking. However, it can also be kind of annoying, as that colour is very bright and pulsing. Holding down the G button on the right-hand side turns o…",

That's basically the gist of what I had to deal with when diving into my first trip alongside fellow PCG writers Kara and Elie: a Peak-adjacent co-op adventure where—instead of climbing up treacherous mountains and fighting for survival—we're forced to haul a metal piece of crap over rocky terrain and down narrow winding paths to reach our destination. (Image credit: Nuggets Entertainment) The whole thing's a game jam put together by Nuggets Entertainment, so things are a little janky right now. I regularly found myself clipping out of the RV which almost spelled my death on a couple of occasions, items we'd packed along for the trip would randomly vanish, and I sometimes would end up defying gravity when grabbing the winch, leaving me floating around in mid-air.

Well hold those thoughts, because Clippy is back. In the most depressing way possible. Microsoft has just released the Fall update for Copilot, the suite of AI tools that Redmond is determined to force-feed us all, and part of this is a whole lot of hot air about the human-AI relationship. Copilot is becoming \"more personal and more adaptable to your needs and style, while holding true to our brand values.\" With apologies to Stewart Lee , here are those Microsoft brand values in full: Put Windows everywhere Sell stuff through Windows Sell more stuff through Windows ?!?
