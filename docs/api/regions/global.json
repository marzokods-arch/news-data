For a lot of people, the appeal is that you can open the Camera app, tap the shutter, and trust Google’s software to do the rest. That ease of use is one of the Pixel’s biggest selling points, but it also means many features find themselves sitting unnoticed in the background. Earlier this month, my colleague Joe Maring dug into that side of the Pixel Camera app, highlighting seven hidden settings that many owners either forget about or never discover in the first place. The list covered everything from composition tools and focus controls to storage and Motion Photo tweaks, all aimed at showing just how much flexibility is hidden beneath the surface.",

With One UI 8.5 rolling out in beta , Samsung has quietly improved one of its most popular customization tools , Theme Park from the Good Lock suite, with a major update that gives Galaxy owners more creative control than ever. One of the most noticeable changes is how themes are organized. You can now bookmark your favorite creations using a heart icon, as spotted by SamMobile . This might seem minor, but it really helps if you often switch up your phone’s look using Good Lock . Instead of rebuilding or searching through saved themes, you can jump straight back to designs you already like.",

The issue predominantly affects phones in the Pixel 7, 8, and 9 series across the stable and beta channels, though a few Samsung users are affected too. The issue has apparently existed for over a year, and Google has acknowledged it, but hasn’t fixed it. The Google Pixel devices are intended to be a role model for the ideal Android experience. Ironically, however, these devices, including the premium ones, suffer from far more bugs than most other popular Android devices. While most of them, thankfully, get fixed in a matter of weeks , there has been one protracted bug that hasn’t been resolved in over a year. And it’s driving people up the wall. For months now, owners of several Google Pixel phones have been experiencing issues connecting to the head unit in their cars. According to several reports, Pixel phones don’t automatically connect to the car’s units immediately and require users to do it manually. For some, manual connections also fail, and the workaround they have figured out is to turn the media audio toggle…",

Zero gravity indicators are small, plush items carried aboard spacecraft to provide a visual indication of when the spacecraft and its crew reach space. For the first eight minutes after liftoff, the crew and their indicator nearby will still be pushed into their seats by gravity, and the force of the climb into space. When the main engines of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s core stage cut off, gravity’s restraints are lifted, but the crew will still be strapped safely into their seats – their zero gravity indicator’s ability to float will provide proof that they’ve made it into space.

Google now shares that access is spreading to Canada, including French support arriving next year. Gemini has finally landed on Google Home in full force — for some of us, anyway. While the big change from Assistant to Gemini has proved incredibly controversial, with plenty of users complaining about feature downgrades , that doesn’t seem to be hurting how many people are still interested in giving it a try for themselves. Earlier this month, Google started seriously speeding up access to Home users in the US who wanted to switch to Gemini, and now we’re finally getting some details on where Gemini’s going next.

The update includes 163 new characters, featuring additions like a distorted face, fight cloud, and orca. You can view these new emoji right now if you install the Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 on a compatible Pixel. Emoji play a core role in how people communicate online, allowing us to express ourselves with playful images and symbols rather than just text. New emoji arrive each year to expand our expressive range, and to ensure they appear correctly on everyone’s device, regardless of the platform, they are codified in the Unicode standard. The latest version — Unicode 17.0 — dropped on September 9, 2025, introducing over 160 new characters. While the stable release of Android doesn’t support them yet, that is set to change with next year’s third quarterly release of Android 16 . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It’s a system-level component, meaning it can’t be uninstalled without root access and can only be toggled off. Even when disabled, the system reportedly attempts to restart Lock Glimpse every few seconds, resulting in unnecessary background activity. Nothing’s latest software experiment is turning into an unexpected headache, and it’s testing the patience of some of the brand’s loyal fans. The trouble is with Lock Glimpse, a lock-screen feature in Nothing OS 4.0 , which started as an optional addition but is now sparking real concern about battery life. Lock Glimpse first appeared in beta builds of Nothing OS 4.0 . On paper, it sounds harmless enough. Nothing frames it as a discovery-focused lock screen experience. You wake your phone and see rotating images paired with short headlines, each linking out to a web article. The pitch is that it adds variety and context. The reality, according to many users , is that it feels a lot like ads wearing a minimalist disguise.",

Google Meet is a free and simple video conferencing program, but it’s not without limitations.

However, Google Meet was historically less versatile when it came to sharing system audio. In an update, Google is tweaking Meet to handle audio sharing better, adding support for sharing device audio with the group. While presenting a specific app window or your computer’s entire screen, Meet can now share your device’s complete system audio with meeting participants. This makes it possible for users to play audio from an app that’s running in the background during a Meet call.

The deal reflects Verizon’s rent-instead-of-own strategy, following its exit from tower ownership last year, which has become the industry norm for all major US carriers. Network improvements are likely to be real but fairly incremental, with limited short-term impact for most users. Earlier this year, T-Mobile formally acquired US Cellular’s customer base , retail footprint, and some of its spectrum in the process. That said, the company behind US Mobile continues as Array. Going forward, Array’s core business is to license its massive collection of former US Cellular towers to other companies, with T-Mobile signing a deal in May to use over 2,000 of them to boost its own coverage.

That’s why we have rounded up a handful of last-minute tech gift ideas that come in under $100 at current prices and don’t necessarily rely on knowing someone’s exact setup. Several of these are the kind of gifts that still make sense even if the recipient already owns something similar, such as a smart light or a useful accessory they didn’t realize they needed. They’re practical, a little bit fun, and easy to slot into everyday life. And yes, a few of them would also make perfectly reasonable “accidental” gifts to yourself.",

    "body": "TL;DR A YouTuber has compared Gemini on Google Home to the chatbot on Android. The video shows that Gemini on Google Home is unable to accomplish a variety of commands, while the Android version handles things just fine. This strongly suggests that you should hold off on upgrading to Gemini on your smart speaker or smart display. Google finally brought Gemini to Google Home and Nest users , allowing smart speaker and smart display owners to get in on the action. Unfortunately, many users have complained that Gemini struggles with basic features compared to Assistant on these devices. But just how bad is it? Well, a new YouTube video paints an extremely ugly picture. YouTuber Adam Hrivnacky posted a video (via Reddit ) comparing Gemini on his Android phone to the chatbot on his Google Nest Hub. The clip, seen above, reveals a major quality gap between the two platforms.",

Instead of launching the Google app, as it does on other Android devices, tapping the search bar on Pixel phones has traditionally opened a unique search overlay that also enables searching for apps, local files, and contacts, and offers a shortcut to search the web in a relatively modern interface. Unfortunately, if you liked that interface, you’d be disheartened to know it is going away. Instead of the unique interface, Google is replacing it with the search screen we’re used to seeing on other non-Pixel devices.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s new tri-fold prioritizes thinness through custom engineering, measuring just 3.9mm when unfolded. A special slimmed-down wireless charging coil from partner Witz was essential for this ultra-thin design. It’s “Qi2 Ready,” but requires a special magnetic case for accessories, as it has no built-in magnets. Foldables have always fought a war on two fronts: You want a massive screen, but you don’t want a brick in your pocket. With the new Galaxy Z TriFold , Samsung has managed to keep the phone slim, measuring only 12.9mm thick when folded and just 3.9mm when open. Achieving this slim design required impressive engineering, especially when it came to powering the device without needing to plug it in. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A new “Share network” toggle in Wi-Fi settings will let you decide if other users can automatically access a specific network without re-entering the password. Although currently in the Canary channel, this feature is expected to arrive in a future Android update, possibly the Android 16 QPR3 beta. Android allows you to create different user profiles, each with its own apps, files, and settings, enabling multiple people to share a single device. Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network? Currently, there is no way to choose which networks to share; once you connect, every other profile automatically gains access. Soon, however, Android will provide an…",
