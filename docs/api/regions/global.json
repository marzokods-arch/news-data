Keep in mind, real-world network performance varies by location, so national rankings may not reflect individual user experiences. Verizon has taken a reputational hit over the last few years. There are many reasons for this shift. Some feel Verizon has dropped the ball when it comes to network quality and performance, but there have also been staff cuts, inconsistent promises, and other issues. Most recently, Verizon suffered a major service outage that affected a large portion of customers across its network . Despite its current reputation, Verizon is still far from down and out.

Alongside defending her title on a near-weekly basis, Lynch is also starring in Star Trek: Starfleet Academy on Paramount+. At home, she’s raising her five-year-old daughter Roux with husband and fellow WWE superstar Seth Rollins; a balancing act fans can see up close in season two of WWE: Unreal on Netflix. While that duality has tested Lynch in new ways, her unflappable confidence — now sharpened by a calculating, heel-leaning persona — has only elevated her swagger. The result is a version of Lynch that feels both untouchable and essential, must-see television for longtime diehards and a new generation of fans alike. “There is nothing I can’t do right now,” Lynch tells Billboard via Zoom. “Just give me anyth…",

    "body": "Credit: Apple TL;DR Apple has announced a new AirTag with a longer Precision Finding range, improved Bluetooth detection, and a much louder built-in speaker. The updated AirTag also adds Precision Finding support on Apple Watch, making it easier to track items without pulling out your phone. Pricing stays the same as before, starting at $29 for one AirTag or $99 for a four-pack. After last month’s leak pointing to a long-overdue refresh, Apple has officially unveiled a new version of its AirTag tracker. While it has been referred to as the “AirTag 2” in the past, Apple isn’t using that name. This is simply the new AirTag, and it’s focused on a more extended range, easier findability, and tighter integration with Apple’s ecosystem. According to the Apple Newsroom , the updated AirTag offers a significantly improved Precision Finding experience thanks to the company’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip. Apple says you can now locate an AirTag from up to 50% farther away than before, while an upgraded Bluetooth chip also extends the range at which nearby devices can help detect it through the Find My network.",

Some headliners, like Beenie Man , who was part of a string of high-grossing, Caribbean-headlined shows at New York&#8217;s UBS Arena last year, are keeping up their momentum from 2025, while others, like Original Koffee, are setting the stage for seismic musical returns. Nonetheless, for most musicians, especially those hailing from Jamaica, the 2026 festival season offers a chance to display national pride as Jamrock continues to rebuild in the wake of Hurricane Melissa&#8217;s devastation . Last year (Oct. 28), the storm became the strongest to strike Jamaica in the island’s history, later making landfall in Cuba (Oct. 29) and wrecking parts of Haiti.

JPL remote-sensing technology recently showed that it can spot plastic pollution on land, but doing so in the sea presents challenges. NOAA Space-based technology could help track plastic and other flotsam by its ‘fingerprints.’ In late 2025, scientists reported that, for the first time, they were able to detect concentrations of plastic pollution on land using NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor aboard the International Space Station. The technology has inspired marine researchers to see whether it could also help track debris in our waters. Before future generations of sensors like EMIT can be called upon to detect ocean litter, scientists need to know what to look for. Working with collaborators, NASA intern Ashley Ohall has built a newly published reference library containing nearly 25,000 molecular “fingerprints” from all manner of flotsam and jetsam, including rope, tires, metal, bubble wrap, buoys, and bottle caps.

The test separates users into two categories: one where the feature is still free and the other where playback speed is a Premium feature. If YouTube is going to convince more users to sign up for a Premium subscription, then it needs features that will make it worth the money. Premium already offers plenty of exclusive benefits , like no ads, background play, offline downloads, and more. A new experiment suggests that YouTube could soon add another must-have feature to this list. However, adding this feature would come at the expense of the platform’s free users.

Scientists using data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have made one of the most detailed, high-resolution maps of dark matter ever produced.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority You might sometimes find yourself looking at your phone bill and wondering whether it’s finally time to ditch your big carrier for something cheaper. You wouldn’t be the only one who has this passing thought on a monthly basis. Verizon in particular tends to spark strong opinions whenever we cover it, especially as prepaid plans keep getting more competitive. After my colleague’s thoughts on the topic, we decided to ask you whether there’s a good reason to leave Verizon right now or if it’s worth sticking with it for the time being. We stuck the poll in Andrew Grush’s own back-and-forth article over whether he should finally leave Verizon himself . The move to prepaid made sense on paper, especially after paying off most of the devices on his account. But once Verizon started stacking discounts and even offered a temporary free line, the math wasn’t quite as clear-cut to him anymore. He wasn’t suddenly Verizon’s biggest fan, but the extra incentives slowed his urgency to jump ship.",

The recomp requires an original ROM of the game and contains no copyrighted assets. The N64 decomp and recomp scene has exploded in the past year, and over the weekend, the latest release was shadowdropped out of nowhere. Despite being a fan project with no involvement from Nintendo or Microsoft (which owns Rare), the Banjo-Kazooie recompilation is fully playable on PC, Linux, and Mac, and fixes and modernizes many aspects of the classic 3D platformer. Banjo: Recompiled is essentially a full remaster of the original game, improving frame rates and adding widescreen support for modern displays. It also enables the use of a second analog stick to control the camera, providing a much more modern control scheme than the C buttons on the N64 controller.",

The new smarts may have given Siri a new brain, but Siri still hasn’t figured out how to use that brain properly. We’ve collectively bullied Siri for years (rightfully so), to the point that Apple has now decided to partner with Google and base Siri on none other than its biggest — and far better — competitor, Gemini. There’s something deeply funny about a company using its rival’s underlying tech because it couldn’t quite build its own or find a better alternative.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android 17 is said to be shifting away from flat design toward translucent, blur-heavy visuals. Google could roll out a frosted-glass look across core UI elements, including the volume slider and power menu. Dynamic Color will reportedly tint blurred panels, helping the new transparency effects blend with your wallpaper and theme. Android 17 is still months from its official launch, but it’s clear that Google plans to change how you use your phone. After years of flat, solid colors, the next version — codenamed “Cinnamon Bun” — is said to focus on translucent, blurry backgrounds. We saw the seeds of this change planted last year with the introduction of Material 3 Expressive , which brought subtle blurs to the notification shade and the Quick Settings panel. Google wanted to create a sense of depth so that the user interface felt lightweight rather than like a heavy, opaque wall of color blocking your view.",

This would be a long-overdue move as most of Samsung’s rivals have offered 256GB of base storage for years now. Samsung is one of the few manufacturers still offering flagship Android phones with 128GB of storage, as seen on the base Galaxy S25. However, a new retail leak has revealed some good news for the Galaxy S26. SuomiMobiili reports (h/t: SammyGuru ) that an unnamed Finnish retailer has posted color and storage details for the Samsung Galaxy S26 range . The base Galaxy S26 will apparently be available in 256GB and 512GB flavors.",

With the AI boom, Google wants to make information accessible without any significant effort, and is extending these principles beyond web search. Last month, it extended the same altruistic virtues to Google Drive, where you now see AI overview-style summaries for your folders . With this change, Google’s AI will look through your folders, any directories within them, the files stored in them, and even the contents of those files, so you can find whatever you’re looking for immediately. These “smart” features in Google Drive are available to all paying Gemini subscribers and Workspace users. Google says it saves time and helps you discover files buried under several layers of folders. But I’m deeply unsettled by Google raking through my files — especially without my explicit consent — and the only solution I feel I have now is to stop trusting Google with anything private.",

However, not every reader agreed with me, and some mentioned a name I hadn’t heard (or used) in years: SwiftKey . I was once an avid SwiftKey user, opting for the innovative keyboard early in my Android journey over Google’s simpler default option. The allure of the more efficient and sensibly designed Google alternative eventually drew me away as I upgraded to more polished devices. But, given that we’ve just started a new year, could the reverse be true? Could SwiftKey challenge Gboard on my devices going forward?",

I use Notion and have spent way too much time just setting up my system within the app, choosing the correct icons, and making sure the colors match across my pages. Because I spent so much time tweaking it, I feel like I have to put it to use, so I try to write down as much as humanly possible to achieve that feeling of being on top of things that matter.

At least he ordered it for professional reasons (I think), but no one who excitedly pre-ordered the T1 phone has seen any sign of it yet. That hasn’t stopped Trump Mobile from thinking about what comes next. According to a company executive, a higher-end “T1 Ultra” may also be in the works. The Verge spotted a largely overlooked interview from November with Trump Mobile executive Don Hendrickson. Speaking to Wireless Dealer Magazine at the time, Hendrickson teased a second phone before the first one had made it into customers’ hands.",

The Artemis II test flight will launch NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, carrying the Orion spacecraft and a crew of four astronauts, on a mission into deep space. The agency’s second mission in the Artemis campaign is a key step in NASA’s path toward establishing a long-term presence at the Moon and confirming the systems needed to support future lunar surface exploration and paving the way for the first crewed mission to Mars. While NASA’s Near Space Network and Deep Space Network , coordinated by the agency’s SCaN (Space Communication and Navigation) program , will provide primary communications and tracking services to support Orion’s launch, journey around the Moon, and return to Earth, participants selected from a request for proposals published in August 2025, comprised of established commercial service providers, members of academia, and individual amateur radio enthusiasts will use their respective …",

Been seeing bizarre, AI-generated headlines in Google Discover? That’s not an accident, Google says. Following an initial experiment last year , the company has confirmed that it plans to continue using AI to whip up titles for certain stories that appear in the Discover feed that lives on Android home screens, without input from the people who write those stories or much attention paid to whether the generated headlines make any sense. As The Verge ‘s Sean Hollister writes, Google has informed the publication that it will continue slapping AI-generated headlines on certain stories in Discover, a decision that, Google says, has been good for “user satisfaction.”",

Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney hinted at the news on X , calling it “spicy details from the Epic v. Google settlement hearing!”",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A two-month-old Galaxy S25 Plus exploded while charging in November 2025, and the affected user reports that Samsung has now admitted liability. The company has reportedly agreed to cover the cost of the phone, medical bills, and cleanup, and has offered $500 per person for pain and suffering. We’ve verified the user’s claims, including the report from the local fire department and Samsung’s offer. Samsung has also shared a statement with Android Authority, stating that its analysis concluded that external force was the cause of the incident. Update: January 23, 2025 (1:36 AM ET): Samsung has now shared an amended statement with us, attributing the incident to “external force.” Since the fire department’s investigation concluded that a thermal runaway event occurred, and per the user’s testimony, the phone was simply charging when the incident occurred, it’s unclear what the company means by referring to external force as the cause of the incident. Here’s the full, amended statement Samsung shared with us:",

The revamped workflow gives you more ways to connect to third-party devices, letting you search by brand name to find both apps and devices to connect to Google’s smart home platform. Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured. With this new workflow, if neither of those are an option, you can type out the name of the specific device you want to get online to initiate pairing.",

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud. Stephen found that focus particularly useful for building his confidence to practice in the real world.",

The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button.

While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well.

Samsung has confirmed the problem, which affects many models from the Galaxy Watch 4 up to the Watch 8 (via SammyGuru ). Multiple users have reported the issue on the Samsung Community forum .",

    "body": "Rumors around Samsung’s upcoming midrange Galaxy A57 have been circulating for months, but the last few weeks gave us more clarity about what to expect, including a full-blown spec sheet that shows an impressive set of features like 45W charging and a large 4,900mAh battery in a slim 6.9mm body. All of this is excellent news for the Galaxy A57, but guess what? These upgrades trample all over the upcoming Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus. This got me thinking: Has Samsung essentially given up on its Galaxy S series? Not the Ultra, of course, but the basic S and S Plus models? Is innovation dead for these phones?",

Fitbit Charge 6: The best fitness tracker overall (band-style) The best band-style fitness tracker comes from one of the oldest players in the game, Fitbit. Though now acquired by Google, the platform still offers fantastic wellness tracking and a user-friendly companion app. The Fitbit Charge 6 offers key upgrades to the fan-favorite Charge line. Most importantly, I have found the lightweight tracker extremely comfortable for workouts and sleep, and I love the colorful AMOLED display for reading stats.

The phone is also rumored to include built-in privacy display technology and an improved anti-reflective coating. These upgrades seemingly aim to eliminate the need for users to apply aftermarket tempered glass screen protectors. The Samsung Galaxy S26 series is still a little while away, but from leaks so far, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is shaping up to be the phone to get from the lineup. Samsung accidentally leaked its upcoming Privacy Display feature yesterday, and today, a new leak suggests we could be getting a new generation of Gorilla Glass on the Galaxy S26 Ultra.
