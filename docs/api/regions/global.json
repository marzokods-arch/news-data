Instead it's a tweak of Xe2, as seen in the Intel Arc B580 desktop GPU and the Lunar Lake laptop chip. We kinda knew that, but now it's absolutely official. But even Intel itself doesn't yet understand how it all relates to the new collab' with Nvidia on PC graphics. Yes, really. In a new podcast with PCWorld , Intel's long suffering graphics rep Tom Petersen has had another stab at clarifying the confusion that's resulted from Intel's recent Panther Lake tech day and that slide . You know, the one that revealed the iGPU in Panther Lake was indeed Xe3-based, but didn't even mention the Celestial architecture that had hitherto to been synonymous with Xe3 and also indicated that the Xe3 iGPU in Panther Lake would be branded \"B\" series, which up until now had been aligned with the Xe2 architecture. In short, it was all utterly baffling. Over to Petersen in response to the question of whether Xe3 in Panther Lake is Cel…",

I've only played the now-vanished demo that was available during the Steam Next Fest and so my thoughts are based strictly on that, but based on my time with it the new game seems like a reasonably competent, utterly unremarkable Doom-style co-op shooter. And it is co-op, whether you like it or not: Even if you choose to play offline, you'll be in the company of bots who spout various bits of bad exposition about who they are and how they came to be there, and in most situations will also quickly take care of all the combat for you if you let them.

The first half of the game crescendos with a pair of classic Obsidian conversation boss fights, and I had a big, dumb smile on my face as I contemplated long, scrolling lists of dialogue options⁠—some available to me, some greyed-out—gated by different skills, background traits, quest choices, and even an out-of-the-way optional conversation I'd had over 10 hours previously. Since I had a ton of points in speech and had gone for nonviolent resolutions whenever possible, I was able to pull off a satisfying \" everybody lives! \" conclusion to this midgame climax.

It'll power the supercomputers of the future, we're consistently told—eventually, once some pesky hurdles have been knocked out of the way. Well, Google has announced just that—a \"major algorithmic breakthrough\" that certainly seems like a hurdle tumbling away in the distance, thanks to the also-esoteric Quantum Echoes algorithm . Google claims it has achieved a verifiable quantum advantage by producing a result 13,000 times faster than a traditional supercomputer. Now I'm going to try and explain to you how it works, so strap in, folks. This might take a while, and I haven't even had my second coffee of the day. Bear with me. One of the major problems with quantum computers is the error rate, thanks to the fact that they use quantum bits, or qubits, as their fundamental unit of information.

That was a hand-me-down, and I distinctly remember begging my mum for an Xbox 360 (then subsequently a second 360 when the first one got hit with a distinct maroon circle). I have (fond?) memories of playing on an Xbox 360 without its case and with the window open to stop it from overheating, and jamming things into the disk tray or banging the top to open it so I can pop in the new Call of Duty game. I even bought an Xbox Series X in 2020 against my better judgment, and it has been demoted to a device I use to access Xbox Game Pass every couple of months when something I really want hits the service. This is all to say, despite good memories of the Xbox brand, things have been going slowly downhill for my appreciation of it, and for the first time ever, I plan on skipping whatever Microsoft puts out next.

On paper, Voyager and the survival management genre is a perfect marriage. One of those couples who go all the way, right into the coffin. A crew lost on the other side of the galaxy, pursued by threats that include the Borg Collective, unable to get any assistance from daddy Starfleet. It's a good fit.

Everything mostly plays out in text, accompanied by sparse art that's generally serviceable but sometimes rather poor, and basic, dead-eyed character models.

Deus Ex: Human Revolution was set in 2027; we simply cannot almost be there in real life. Ahem. The good news is that that 'release window' is set to become a 'release date' imminently. Mouse's date is set to hit literally today, as part of the ongoing Galaxies Gaming Showcase. It'll just be a date in 2026 rather than 2025, now. If you've not been keeping track, Mouse is a good ol'-fashioned FPS in a good ol'-fashioned style. Literally. The game's done up like Steamboat Willy—a black-and-white, cartoon-ified world filled with '20s gangster-rodents for you to tommy-gun your way through.

One blocker to that might be hesitation over the new bespoke version of Windows running on the handheld. However, it turns out the handheld can run Bazzite—a Linux OS extremely similar to SteamOS—and doing so actually improves performance. That's going by tech YouTuber Cyber Dopamine's ad-hoc testing (via Tom's Hardware ). They got Bazzite up and running and spoke to one of the operating system's devs who ironed out any bugs and got the OS running well on the ROG Xbox Ally X. The end result is an ROG Xbox Ally X that seems to offer a better handheld gaming experience, though only in the games that actually work on Linux, of course. Bazzite isn't SteamOS, but it runs Steam's Big Picture Mode on top of a custom Fedora Linux distribution, and looks and runs essentially the same as SteamOS, with some extra options and so on. That in itself is a point in its favour, by my books, because SteamOS is very simple to use—it's one of the reasons I rate the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS so highly.

Players didn't like how currency gain slowed to a crawl (that has since been fixed ) and server woes were widely reported. But one of the enduring complaints about Siege X is that the shift to free-to-play has triggered a huge uptick in cheating. I caught up with Siege creative director Alexander Karpazis at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week. I asked if the team at Ubisoft Montreal expected cheating to surge to the extent that it did in June. \"We knew having free access that it could be a vector that is exploited,\" he said, \"and we were ramping up our R6 ShieldGuard. In a lot of ways it really did help, but we need to be faster when it comes to making sure that we stay one step ahead of cheat makers, too.\" Eliminating cheating entirely is impossible, I acknowledged, and Karpazis agreed. \"Absolutely. That's a message that we keep on having to share with our community. It's not something where we'll receive zero percent cheating. \"But there is a goal for us to make sure that, again, if we stay ahead of cheating and we address it fas…",

He listed Tekken 1-5 as his \"most hated\" games and had public \"feuds\" with Tekken's Katsuhiro Harada and Devil May Cry's Hideki Kamiya. While working on 2005's Ninja Gaiden Black, he said that Devil May Cry 3 director Hideaki Itsuno—who went on to make DMC 4, 5, and Dragon's Dogma—\"did pretty well for a young guy\" and \"might make something even better next time.\" Behind the blustery facade, Itagaki seemingly respected his action game peers a great deal; roasting them was his way of projecting the image of a true Master Ninja. But as I tried to convey in my Ninja Gaiden 4 review , Itagaki's games were different from the ones his competitors were making. It wasn't just that they tended to be more challenging, but that they took themselves so seriously; the winking tone that Kamiya favored with DMC's Dante and later Bayonetta were nowhere to be found in Itagaki's games. His sense of humor was adding an easier \"Ninja Dog\" mode to Ninja Gaiden for players who died too many times on the first level. The most cosmically strange thing about Ninja Gaiden 4…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Steam reviews are an endless source of both information and amusement. Where else can you read a review from someone who has played a survival game for 35,000 hours before giving it a thumbs-down ? Or, for that matter, find a glowing review of an MMO someone has played for less than an hour? But the best Steam reviews, for my money, are the ones where a player hammers out a review that encapsulates an entire game in just a few words, like the one in the image above by Steam user \"Cyber Lesbian\" for Marvel Rivals. Short reviews are like mini-poems, really, and even when they're silly they can still tell you a lot about game. I put a quiz together a few weeks ago to challenge you to identify 10 games based only on a blurb from a Steam review . It went over well, so we're doing it again! In the quiz below, see if you can guess the game based on a short Steam review . And let us know how you scored in the comments: overwhelmingly positive, or mostly negative?",

Cards Against Humanity purchased the plot of land, located near the border between the US and Mexico, in 2017 to protest (and, one would assume, hinder) the erection of a wall between the two countries. In 2023, a local homeowner noticed that SpaceX was using the site for building materials and heavy equipment and brought it to CAH's attention, after which SpaceX gave CAH a \"12-hour ultimatum to accept a lowball offer\" for the land. Instead, CAH sued. The settlement came shortly before the case went to trial, which was scheduled to happen on November 3. CAH told AP that SpaceX copped to trespassing during the discovery phase, but it opted to settle because a trial \"would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX.\" Beyond that, CAH said \"the upside is that SpaceX has removed their construction equipment from our land and we’re able to work with a local landscaping company to restore the …",

But despite how Escape From Duckov presents itself, it actually doesn't waste much time on duck material. Yes, almost every NPC is some type of waterfowl, and yes, enemies quack when they notice you. But aside from an occasional duck egg consumable, there's not much duck humor going on at all. In fact, you don't even really have to play as one: The duck customization options give you all the tools to craft a different bird entirely. Or a sort of Fall Guys-esque bean man. Or Heihachi from Tekken.

They're gorgeous, distinct, spacious, and most importantly, they're packing loads of vehicles.

In all seriousness, Hello Games long ago completed the redemption arc for No Man's Sky, (which now sits at \"Very Positive\" on Steam with around 170,000 reviews) and for years now has been on a well-deserved victory lap. We can have a laugh about Murray's inability to leave the 'we're just the little guys' schtick behind, but at the same time there's no doubting that love has been poured into this game over just shy of a decade. No Man's Sky received the major Voyager update just over a month ago , adding the ability to build and customise giant spaceships known as Corvettes that you can get your mates to act as crew on.

Chopping logs into planks means construction on new buildings can commence, but if people are freezing in their homes, that timber should be turned into firewood instead. And assigning laborers to salvage nearby ruins for resources should be put on hold if—and here's just one quick example—a giant angry bear is rampaging through the town brutally mauling everybody to death.

But if, like me, the Evo is your first foray into Secretlab's world of desks, it's a worthy investment—if you can stomach its hefty price tag. When the Secretlab Magnus Evo first arrived, the biggest thing that stuck out to me was just how heavy the thing was. I opted for the 1.5 m desk length for my small apartment—though it also comes in the slightly larger 1.7 m length option—and with a metal frame containing motor work in the legs, my delivery tracking informed me that the box came in at a whopping 63 kg. Thankfully I had the foresight to call a friend for help with assembly, and I would definitely recommend two people to put the Magnus Evo together. The parts are heavy, and the desk has to be assembled upside down before lifted upright. The actual process of putting the desk together was simple—I'd consider myself to be a little illiterate…",

Well, I've got a few theories, and I'd like to dig into them, but before I do: I think the MMO genre is actually in a pretty good place, right now. It's aging, certainly (we'll get into that later) but you certainly aren't spoiled for good offerings. World of Warcraft's got its juice back , and it's adding player housing soon. Final Fantasy 14 looks like it's on a course-correction . Guild Wars 2 and The Elder Scrolls: Online are great exploratory romps. Even those outside the big leagues are merrily trucking along.

Nevertheless, it's a topic that's plagued Battlefield 6 since the very beginning, though its slate of strong military skins at launch was refreshing, to say the least. But with the launch in the rearview mirror now, all eyes are on Battlefield 6 Season 1 to see whether or not that grounded, military feeling is completely thrown to the wayside. After a handful of hours playing Season 1's content early, I can report that the first batch of post-launch cosmetics largely continues to deliver more grounded styles, but those of you who draw the distinction between tactical military gear and more stylised, 'cool' soldier apparel more strictly might see where this could potentially end up.

It's just been updated with a new M5 chip and a bizarre headband, but yep, that's the Vision Pro alright—still looking like an intriguing, but oddly-designed take on how the future of wearable tech should be. Well, Samsung has just launched its Galaxy XR headset , and if I'm not mistaken, I think I can hear the poor old Vision Pro howling from over here. Samsung looks to have used Apple's product as an example of what not to do, as many of the critiques of the Vision Pro seem fixed—on paper, at least. The pricing, for one. At $1,800, the Galaxy XR is still a bit of a teeth-clencher, but it's still nearly half the price of Apple's initial offering.

According to this blog post on the Microsoft Dev site by Raymond Cheng , pifmgr.dll was added in Windows 95 and is chock full of icons that were created mostly for fun. The idea was that they provided a library of icons \"for people to use for their own homemade shortcut files.\" If Cheng's list is complete, there are a grand total of 38 icons contained in the dll file. The dll also does duty, \"as the name might suggest, to manage PIF files, which are Program Information Files that describe how to set up a virtual MS-DOS session for running a specific application.\" And yet it still clocks in at just 38 kilobytes. Remarkable in an age when your typical minor software update is measured in gigabytes and a multiple-terabyte SSD get filled up in picoseconds. Well, ish.

There's no source given for these charts, but it tracks with other analysis and even consumer tracking such as on pcpartpicker.com , and Wang is a reliable industry analyst. The AI boom (or bubble) has most certainly played a big part in this, because AI datacentres require tons of DRAM for stacks of high bandwidth memory (HBM). And while DDR5 memory offers the latest and greatest on this front, much of this will be spoken for by big customers, leading many to fall back to DDR4, creating more demand and causing this price rise. This will have combined with declining DDR4 production as DRAM manufacturers transition more heavily towards DDR5, resulting in tons of demand and less supply. Thus, higher prices.

This is, by far, the most intense yet breathable map in Battlefield 6, but what struck me is how instantly iconic it felt. Battlefield 6's maps have been controversial since the very beginning, to say the least. Of its launch offerings, I think Siege of Cairo is fantastic (as is the returning Operation Firestorm), and I'm open to Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak, and even New Sobek City when people aren't abusing the rooftops. But other than Cairo, I wouldn't say any of these arenas are all that memorable or iconic. If you've instead been waiting for more of the large-scale warfare that the series is traditionally known for, then Season 1 will be a salve.

But this is the really exciting bit. Not only will this factory focus on OLED panels for monitors, laptops and tablets, at least at first, but it also uses a novel inkjet manufacturing process to reduce costs. Currently, virtually all PC monitors with OLED screens are based on panels from just two suppliers—LG and Samsung. This duopoly is obviously never going to be a good thing for pricing and competition. So, the insertion of TCL into the fray is most welcome. According to flatpanelshd , TCL will invest over $4 billion into to the new facility, known as T8 and located in Guangzhou, China. The factory will use a so-called 8.6-generation production process, creating huge 2.29 by 2.62 metre OLED substrates, which can then be sliced into smaller screens. TCL currently produces OLED panels on the 5.5G process, mainly for smaller displays that go into laptops, tablets and phones. Aside from the size of the substrate being produced, TCL's new factory is also interesting by virtue of using an inkjet process to \"print\" the panels . LG an…",

While there, they're given a functionally infinite power scaling mechanic courtesy of the Infinite Dragonflight. This kinda breaks the usual holy trinity of tanks, healers, and DPS, however—because if you're able to scale your DPS so high you can melt raid bosses solo, then why wouldn't you just pick the classes with the most in-built damage resistance and defensive cooldowns? As such, the Mythic+ listings for Legion Remix are flooded with shield icons. It's tanks all the way down. Well, Blizzard's trying to address that, per a post sent to the Blizzard forums yesterday. Healers and DPS specs in Legion Remix can now enjoy a 10% increase to their damage, a 33% reduction in damage taken, and a whopping 100% increase to their max HP.
