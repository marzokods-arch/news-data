Whether I get extraction camped or betrayed by some randomer who lied about being friendly, death is never too far away in Arc Raiders, especially when people have Trigger Nades. These little detonated grenades have become something of a menace in Arc Raiders as they are powerful enough to take out a raider in a couple of hits and can be activated from afar, killing unsuspecting players. (Image credit: Jinko on YouTube) My first encounter with one was at the Swamp Extraction at Dam Battlegrounds. I had innocently wandered up to the extract to call it, only to be met with a flash of light and sudden death as some rat had placed a couple of Trigger Nades on the call button and scuttled away into the bushes to wait for their victim.

Turns out, that 'next-gen' AMD CPU option is one of the not actually all that new Ryzen AI 400 chips, specifically the AMD Ryzen AI 9 465.

    "body": "Along with teasing some very skinny new Alienware laptops , one of the highlights of Dell's CES keynote was the return of the XPS brand in the form of some very slick new portable PCs . Notably, Dell isn't offering discrete graphics options with the new laptops, the implication being that the iGPU in the new Panther Lake CPU makes that unnecessary. Putting aside the fact that killing off the XPS brand never seemed like a good idea, Dell's new laptops certainly look like a promising return for the XPS line. Initially, Dell is launching the XPS 14 and XPS 16, with a 13-inch model to follow. Key attributes for the XPS 14 and 16 models include extremely high quality build quality, the \"best battery life in the industry\" and optional tandem OLED displays. Chassis-wise, the laptops have an all-new design that has some similarities with previous XPS laptops, but does away with the capacitive function keys that proved so controversial, returning that top row of buttons to the keyboard proper. Dell has also added subtle etching on the otherwise seamless glass trackpad panel below the keyboard, again addressing a design issue with the previous XPS design, which left users guessing exactly w…",

From the lush greens of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater to the smattering of golds, blues and black in Death Stranding , he has spent decades working on games that stand out from the first screenshot. It's no surprise then that Asus' most recent collaboration with the creator looks pretty snazzy. Announced at CES 2026, Asus' collab with Kojima Productions includes custom colourways for the ROG Delta II gaming headset, Keris II gaming mouse, Scabbard II mouse mat, a custom carry case, and finally the ROG Flow Z13 . This collaboration is a very white and gold affair, with iconography largely left to Kojima Productions' iconic Ludens character. Designed by long-term Kojima collaborator and Kojima Productions lead artist Yoji Shinkawa, Ludens is somewhat of a high-tech knight figure and effectively the mascot for the company. Shinkawa says, \"I wanted to create a gadget that belongs to Ludens\", and he says the tech \"has its essence.\" The only real letdown for me here is the presence of the ROG Flow Z13.

That's because vendors use basic items for cases and fans to cut costs wherever possible. But what happens when a PC manufacturer doesn't skimp on the goodies and goes all out to impress? Well, you get something like the new Asus ROG G1000 : a hulking monster of a rig with three holographic fans. Asus calls the setup AniMe Holo, claiming that it's the \"world’s first holographic fan system in a prebuilt gaming PC\". The G1000 boasts one 380 mm fan with 720 LEDs and two 215 mm fans with 404 lights. These don't blast air around the PC; instead, they spin up to a point where you visually can't see the blades in motion and via a button on the top panel (or through Asus' Armoury Crate software), signals are sent to the lights to create patterns, animations, and so on before your eyes. I'm doing a poor job of describing it, so watch Asus' video above to get the full picture (if you pardon the pun). Whether it looks as crisp as that in real life is anyone's guess, but the general consensus in the PC Gamer HW office is that it looks kinda neat. Of course, having such b…",

And there is at least one interesting way to use it for gaming. The Zephyrus Duo . Fit with two 16-inch, 3K, 120 Hz, OLED screens, and one of which sits right where a keyboard usually would. The entire laptop is hinged: able to rotate up to 320° with a kickstand on the rear to sit it upright. In the promo materials, Asus shows how one might use the second screen in a number of different ways. Including laying it flat for a large tablet surface, setting it upright in 'Book Mode', or flipping it into an A-frame via 'Tent Mode' and playing local co-op games with a friend on both sides of the device. Hey, that's… actually pretty neat. There is a keyboard and trackpad. These are included on a separate, detachable slab that can be attached magnetically over the second screen. It can also be used separately via Bluetooth. The keyboard offers the same 1.7 mm key travel as normal Zephyrus laptops.

Every new piece of technology, whether that's a laptop, graphics card, mouse, keyboard, BBQ, whatever, is now presented as being powered by AI or comes with an AI assistant, or just has an 'AI' sticker on the box.

Ah, it's nice to have a win over the endless AI guff, isn't it? Anyway, headline news is that Intel is claiming up to a 77% integrated graphics performance boost over the previous Lunar Lake-based Intel Core Ultra 9 288V with the top end chips. That's a pretty bold statement, given how impressed we were with Lunar Lake's gaming performance overall. (Image credit: Future) Intel has also promised much improvement in its GPU driver stack, which, if true, could make these mobile beasties a force to be reckoned with for slim and light gaming machines. Key to the claimed performance figures are the architectural changes under the silicon hood.

If I give you one thing to walk away with, it's the following: the consumer business is important to Dell.\" The whole briefing felt very much like a mea culpa from the massive PC box shifter, but it looks like the company is putting its product where its marketing mouth is, what with the return of the XPS brand, reining back its effusive AI marketing, and throwing cheaper Alienware notebooks out into the wild.

When it comes to boost clocks, the latter can hit 5.7 GHz, whereas the former topped out at 5.5 GHz in the tests I carried out in my review of the 9950X3D . This suggests that the CCDs rolling off TSMC's production lines are generally very high quality, resulting in a surfeit of CCDs that, when they've also gone through the V-cache packing routine, are more than capable …",

    "body": "At this year's CES event, AMD hasn't really introduced anything completely new in its consumer CPU portfolio. They've either rebadged old chips or just expanded current ranges with a few more models. However, the Ryzen AI Max series of APUs has picked up two extra processors, and one of them could well be the best chip to fit into any top-tier handheld gaming PC. As a quick refresher, Ryzen AI Max processors (aka Strix Halo ) comprise one or two core chiplets (CCDs) plus a huge input/output chiplet (IOD) that houses a pretty beefy GPU. It has 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units (2560 shaders), with 64 MB of Level 3 cache, and a unified memory bus that's 256-bits wide. (Image credit: AMD) Up until now, the only entry in the series that sported the full 40 CUs was the very expensive Ryzen AI Max+ 395 . That all changes with the two new chips: the Max+ 392 and Max+ 388. The former has two CCDs for 12 cores, 24 threads in total, whereas the latter uses a single CCD sporting 8 cores, 16 threads. The current Ryzen AI Max 385 is also a single CCD chip, but its GPU only houses 32 CUs. With the Max+ 388, you're getting the best Strix Halo processor for gaming: 8 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores/CUs.

It's been designed to 'completely ignore the concepts of balance in favour of extremes', according to the launch presentation I just attended, and boy howdy has MSI refused to do things by halves. Well, we are in Vegas , after all. For a start, there's an 8-inch display mounted to the card itself, which has eschewed a regular air cooler for an external 360 mm radiator with a three fan cooling arrangement. It's fed by a newly-designed pump that MSI says delivers 71% increased flow over previous GPU pump iterations, which is in turn attached to a full copper, full cover cold plate arrangement designed to keep things frosty. With a carbon fibre plate on the back, naturally. And frosty it'll need to be, as this beast is built to draw huge amounts of power.

The rebrand didn't last long: after a fierce outcry from people who correctly thought the new logo sucked, Corsair swapped to a refreshed take on the sail logo, which it's been using ever since. Corsair was established in 1994, and made about $1.4 billion last year—which I bring up because today Microsoft, a slightly bigger company, has slipped on its own rebranding banana peel. The company is seemingly all but ditching the Office name—which it introduced four years before Corsair existed, and which drove more than $30 billion in revenue just last quarter —with a catchy new name: \"Microsoft 365 Copilot app.\" Copilot is, notably, a thing that already exists! But as part of the ongoing effort to juice AI assistant usage numbers by making it impossible to not use AI, Microsoft has decided to just call its whole productivity software suite Copilot, I guess.

We've all been there. Late on Sunday, reports started emerging on Reddit and elsewhere that players were unable to login to League of Legends, with their attempts stalling out indefinitely at the game's initial loading screen. While Riot shortly said it was \"looking into the issue,\" players quickly narrowed in on the root of the problem after checking the client's error logs: Windows was rejecting its connection attempts because of an expired SSL certificate. SSL—short for \"Secure Sockets Layer\"—is a security protocol for establishing encrypted connections between a server and client.

So, if TMR isn't your thing for whatever reason, the MX 8.2 will allow you to swap between both magnetic and mechanical switches. If you stick with the Cherry MK Crystal Magnetic switches, you'll enjoy \"ultra-smooth linear input with 0.01 mm precision\" alongside an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate. The wireless, tenkeyless MX 8.2 Pro TMR keyboard will cost about $250 when it releases on January 29, though it won't be lonely in the lineup for long. The K5 Pro TMR keyboard—a follow-up to the wired Cherry Xtrfy K5V2 from 2024—will drop later in the Spring. This 65% board will also offer MK Crystal Magnetic switches, plus a polling rate of up to 8,000 Hz. Pricing has yet to be confirmed. Magnetic tech isn't exa…",

The standard TR100 is a dual-chamber, Mini-ITX case, which is to say it's a compact bit of tech. At $150, it's also a reasonably priced start to a small build. Even if the rest of your build will be torturously expensive. The Koralie edition offers much the same, except at a currently unknown price point. Each case is numbered and signed, and the presence of a store page implies that some will be able to purchase it, but we don't have much more on it just yet. The case itself is blue with a striking symmetrical design, which Thermaltake says is inspired by \"Mediterranean, Asian, Art Deco, and Indigenous aesthetics\".

Spokesman Brad Callaway told the arcade industry's RePlay magazine that Rosen died December 25, 2025, at his home in Los Angeles, surrounded by family. Rosen was a former US airman stationed in post-war Japan and the Far East, and after his service ended in 1952 stayed in Japan, first founding the company Rosen Enterprises, Inc., which sold Japanese art in the US market and also had a successful business in photo booths called Photorama. In 1957, the company's focus changed to importing coin-operated amusement machines to Japan, which proved lucrative, and establishing its own venues. \"Right off the bat, the machines were tremendously successful,\" Rosen told Next Generation Magazine in 1996 . \"At this point, I was opening up arcades with these shooting and hunting games throughout Japan, and we were fortunate… I don’t know [how many we had], but by the time I left, there wasn’t a city in Japan that didn’t have one of our arcades.\" In 1965, Rosen Enterprises merged with Nihon Goraku Bussan, which used Sega as a brand name for coin-op machines: the name comes from a contra…",

You need to layer up properly so all your pointy metal armour bits don't hurt your delicates. It could have been even more persnickety. In a chat with PC Gamer , Warhorse co-founder and KCD2 executive producer Martin Klima recalled a scrapped system that would have seen Henry gain and lose weight depending on how much you ate, preventing you from wearing certain items of clothing and armour. \"Currently in the game as we released it, all men wear the same clothes you do… basically, you can put on anything that you find,\" Klima said. But earlier in development, Warhorse toyed around with a different system: \"Some NPCs would be fat and some would be thin, and then the clothing they wear would be either too large or too small for you.\" But ol' Henry would be malleable.

With a screen being so close to your eyes and intended to give such a huge screen digital experience, this feels very low given how large the virtual screen will be. Still, the display is impressive, with the Xreal R1 AR being the first 240 Hz gaming glasses. A Micro-OLED screen should look mighty impressive, but font fringing is a worry on OLED panels, especially at lower resolutions. These are designed as gaming glasses, so that should be less of a worry, but it's certainly something I'd consider if I wanted to use them in a productivity capacity too.

    "body": "Capcom couldn't have hoped for a better environment to release Monster Hunter Wilds into. Monster Hunter was already ascendant: World was a breakout success that thrust the series into global awareness, and after glutting itself on Elden Ring the gaming public had a mainstream interest in precise, demanding third person combat and systems-heavy buildcraft. At launch, that math held true. In three days, Monster Hunter Wilds had sold a triumphant 8 million copies—the fastest-selling launch in Capcom's history. 10 months later, the story of Monster Hunter Wilds has a very different tone. On Steam, its review rating hangs at a middling Mixed, having intermittently plunged to Mostly Negative when updates either neglect or worsen the game's profound performance issues. By July, its sales had collapsed—and after news broke that it had gone from 10 million launch sales to less than 500,000 in a quarter, Capcom's stock price plummeted alongside. (Image credit: Capcom) When I spoke to Wilds art director and executive director Kaname Fujioka in December 2024, he said Wilds was an attempt to ensure that the world can \"truly become fans of the franchise.\" It was aimed at securing Monster Hunte…",

Is there evidence for this? Nope— quite the opposite, actually —but it endures because it jibes with the worldview of certain Fallout fans who see Bethesda as perverting the series. Regardless, here's one more bit of evidence for the 'Howard doesn't hate Obsidian' pile: in a chat with Game Informer (via GamesRadar ), Howard said that, when it came to a non-Bethesda studio making a Fallout game, it was Obsidian or bust. \"They were the only choice,\" said Howard. \"They had done something similar with Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well.\" In 2004, Obsidian put out Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2—a follow-up to BioWare's KOTOR 1 that more than a few people (myself included) came to regard as their favourite of the two games, and that despite the fact Obsidian had barely over a year to make the whole thing.

Two: anime melodrama. If you love characters scream-crying through their emotional beats more than reading FromSoft flavor text like \"If the soul is the source of all life, then what distinguishes the humanity we hold within ourselves?\" , this action RPG holds great potential for you. I can't say that the anime Dark Souls angle grabbed me in the three hours or so I spent playing it at a preview event in December, but Code Vein 2 is also, depending on how you choose to play it, Dark Souls But You Have a Gun. Now that's got some pull. It feels like wielding a forbidden instrument. Illicit. I'm harnessing a power typically reserved for comedic punctuation. Do I just think that because I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark at a young age and instantly formed a new personality the moment Indiana Jones Smith & Wesson'd that sword guy into oblivion?

The DLC is split into levels in which you need to find clues and solve puzzles, but its open-world nature means you can explore at your own pace too. You're able to venture through Mirkwood forest, the Starcourt Mall, and even throw yourself into the Upside Down if you're feeling brave. It's actually scarier than the Nether, especially when you've got a pack of demogorgons on your tail. As you make your way around the world and solve the various puzzles tucked away, the world will \"evolve\" to give you new areas to explore as well. To coincide with the setting, most of Stranger Things' iconic characters are available to play as too, and each comes with unique abilities to help you make your way through Hawkins.

The game got a poor reception, including from us. Steven Messner scored the game 55% in his Anthem review and called it \"deeply flawed and frequently frustrating,\" though very pretty indeed (I am often described the same way). BioWare pledged to \"reinvent\" the game around a year after release until another year later in 2021, when EA execs said 'Actually, hold that thought', and cancelled development entirely. Despite all that, the game's servers have been up and running for all that time; the world's slim supply of Anthem-heads have been able to get their fill for years. But it's all about to come to an end. Anthem's servers are set to finally judder to a halt on January 12, 2026, putting an end to any way to play the game.

For the unfamiliar, Troika is a very 'realheads know' sort of studio: Its games presaged the similarly buggy (and occasionally unfinished) early work by Obsidian, which was also founded by ex-Interplay devs. But, also like Obsidian, Troika's games were ambitious, imaginative, and unforgettable. They had strong word-of-mouth reputations on RPG forums, and all three of its games have received essential fan patches and laudatory reappraisals, with the Big Kahuna arguably being the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines . \"We had a lot of feature ideas, we did not edit ourselves at all, and we were a small team,\" Cain summarized at the beginning of the video. \"Every time Troika went to make a game, whether it was Arcanum, or Temple of Elemental Evil, or Bloodlines, there were just so many things we wanted to do.

It maybe also doesn't hurt that getting to know this guy post-mortem can get you kitted out with his sick armor and custom rifle ⁠—Bethesda even made a limited run of statues of the character . Scattered throughout New Vegas' Honest Hearts expansion, Clark's journals are an autobiographical account of the bombs falling and his experiences (and eventual death) in the world that followed. It includes the loss of his family, his adventures as a solo survivalist, and run-ins with various others, like a group of children that he becomes caretaker for in his old age, unwittingly laying the groundwork for a new tribal culture you meet in the present day, the Sorrows. For New Vegas lead writer John Gonzalez, it was one of the only things he wrote for the RPG's lauded series of DLCs before leaving Obsidian in March 2011 to work on Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.
