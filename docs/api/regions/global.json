    "body": "Game developer Rebecca Heineman has died after being diagnosed with cancer last month. The news was shared to Bluesky by Heineman's friend, Heidi McDonald , while the most recent post on Heineman's GoFundMe is a goodbye message stating that her health was rapidly deteriorating, and she was entering palliative care. Heineman was 62, and the GoFundMe will remain live to help her family make final arrangements. Born in 1963, Heineman initially made a mark on the industry by winning a national Space Invaders tournament in 1980 in New York, becoming the first formally recognized US champion of any videogame. She went on to have a far-reaching career, being credited on 67 games according to MobyGames . Heineman co-founded Interplay in 1983 alongside Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell. The developer and publisher was the source of many foundational PC games, including Wasteland, Fallout, and Baldur's Gate. Heineman designed and programmed a number of games at Interplay, with her most prominent design credit being The Bard's Tale 3: Thief of Fate. Heineman's friend and colleague from Interplay, Brian Fargo, shared a remembrance of the developer on X. \"Rebecca Heineman sadly passed a…",

None of the suspicious lines of CS:GO code or yarn-webbed conspiracy board YouTube videos have actually preceded an announcement of the fabled Half-Life 2 sequel. And yet, here we all are again, charging down the field with renewed gusto following Valve's big hardware announcements . Given how many times we've ended up flat on our backs behind an unkicked football, I cringe to say this, but it's not unreasonable to believe that a new Half-Life game will be announced within the next year or so. The recent excitement on the Half-Life subreddit is partially due to misunderstandings (reporter Jason Schreier does not in fact have insider information about an imminent announcement), but is at least somewhat justified by the facts: The idea that Valve might release a new Half-Life game is no longer in the realm of pure imagination, as it put out the VR-only Half-Life: Alyx in 2020 The Half-Life: Alyx ending (spoilers) very much leaves the door open for future Half-Life games Five years is enough time to have made a new Half-Life game (although barely,…",

Some crash and burn on day one while others are kept alive by players, modders, and community creators long after they might have otherwise slipped away. A few games, however, have lived on for decades, kept alive not just by passionate fans but by developers who have never thrown in the towel or dusted off their hands and said \"done.\" These games have, against all odds, managed to withstand the test of time. They're still being worked on after 20, 30, even 40(!) years. When we first wrote a version of this list in 2018, all of the games we included had been updated that year. Amazingly, seven years later they're all still alive, even if updates are a bit fewer and farther between. But almost every entry on this updated list has either been updated in 2025, or in the last couple years, with its development history making us pretty sure they'll still see another patch in the second half of this decade.

I love it so much. Demon King producer Andy Han got me in touch with Daifuku so I could find out how you make a game that sounds like literal hell. The answer, it seems, is some incredibly creative (and occasionally painful) sample work. \"Making the sounds was basically just layering, spectrally morphing and manipulating samples until I found something I thought sounded cool,\" Daifuku said. \"Most of the sounds I made were simply happy accidents, such as the Nure-onna gasping before she feeds, which was me accidentally eating very stale banana chips.\" Unfortunately, the exact scene Daifuku is referencing is not on YouTube, but I'm pretty sure you can hear the gasp in question (followed by some stomach-churning slurping) at the 57-second mark of this trailer for Labyrinth of the Demon King. \"I thought…",

The filing claims Kim went so far as to consult with AI to figure a way out of paying, but even ChatGPT told him he was probably stuck. The legal dispute between Krafton and Subnautica designer and director Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire has been dragging on since July, when all three very suddenly left their positions . While the departures were initially presented as amicable, it quickly became clear that it was anything but. Legal action was filed by both sides and it's gotten very messy: Krafton initially said the three were fired because of the state of Subnautica 2 and their insistence on releasing it before it was ready, but in September it seemed to drop that claim in favor of focusing on allegations the founders had \"deceived\" Krafton , including that they'd downloaded confidential informatio…",

Notorious for showing up right after a controversial balance patch last year , the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur has been released from its cage and it might be the reason WoW Tokens are currently sold out in the UK. The mount was extraordinarily popular last time. Players were crowding the streets with it, which led some other players to despair as this absurdly priced microtransaction seemingly got more attention than a botched patch. That's not exactly the case this time, but there are still people who hate that it even exists. Most of the fervor for the dinosaur mount is because it comes with an auction house and mailbox attached to it, unlike almost every other mount in the game.

The problem is they keep getting cancelled before anyone gets to see them. \"People often ask me why I don't make a sequel to Nier, or why I'm not working, but that's because I've had so many projects that have been discontinued lately,\" Yoko said via machine translation. \"Even though I was working, it wasn't released to the public. I'm getting paid, so it's not a problem for me personally, but because my output isn't being released to the public, people see me as not working.\" While that's particularly disappointing for anyone hoping for more Yoko Taro-brand weirdness, the Nier creator is just one of many game developers who've recently had to watch their work evaporate. 2025 has continued a years-long rash of game cancellations, studio closures, …",

Joseph O'Connor, now 26 years old, hijacked over 130 accounts, including those of Apple, Uber, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Kanye West. Alongside other hackers, three of whom have been charged, they then impersonated the companies / individuals in question and used the accounts to promote a classic \"double your money\" scam. The hijacked accounts would send tweets asking followers to send Bitcoin to digital wallets, promising that the money would be doubled and returned. An estimated 350 million Twitter users viewed these dodgy tweets and, over 15-16 July 2020, a total of 426 transfers totalling 12.86 Bitcoin was made to the wallets. This would have been worth around $110,000 in 2020: now the value would be more like $1.2 million. The hack itself, as they often are, was more down to social engineering than cyber genius.

The second is Secure Boot, which you may also recognise from the Battlefield 6, err, fiasco , as it needs to be properly enabled on your machine before you can play the game. The third is Virtualization-based Security (VBS), which is used to keep vital parts of Windows (like the kernel) in an isolated environment.

Japanese actor and model Konatsu Kato lends her voice and likeness to protagonist Shimizu Hinako in Silent Hill f. But Kato has also been livestreaming her own playthrough of the game since October, fulfilling a promise she made to fans earlier in the month. Her streams have since gone viral, with the VODs of her streams receiving millions of views on YouTube . As reported by Automaton Media, part of the reason behind the popularity of Kato's streams is her specific journey with the game. More than just being about her reactions and opinions, Kato is not a regular gamer, so Silent Hill f has proved a bit of a baptism of fire for her.

There are a few significant tweaks here, but the things that stand out to me are: yet more fixes for the game's A-Life system and a whole new difficulty. That's in descending order of importance, so far as I'm concerned. The A-Life fixes sound a lot more interesting than GSC's prosaic \"Fixes and improvements to the A-Life system\" makes it sound. If you're not familiar, A-Life is the name GSC gives to the systems in all its Stalker games that, more or less, let the games' beasts and NPCs pursue independent lives and objectives.

Probably the biggest tribute I can pay Phasmophobia, though, is that it's still on my SSD. I don't play it all the time, but it's one of those games where someone suggests it as a palate-cleanser after some sweaty PVP, and everyone's instantly on-board.

    "body": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 came under intense fire last week, with players and developers alike criticising Activision Blizzard's use of generative AI to produce many of the game's calling cards. Now, US Congressman Ro Khanna has weighed in on the furore, calling for proper regulations on AI use in the wake of the controversy. Responding to the social media post that triggered the debate on X (via Eurogamer ) Khanna stated: \"We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. They should share in the profits. And there should be a tax on mass displacement.\" This is not a new position for Khanna, who has been calling for regulations on how generative AI is both created and deployed in the US. In an interview with the Verge last year , Khanna provided a detailed explanation of his position on AI. He criticised both the datasets genAI systems are trained upon, pointing out that models up to that point had been \"trained with generative AI on everything on the Internet without necessarily distinguishing what is true from false\", as well as how the technology makes it e…",

Before they ended up making a live-service multiplayer shooter (and more recently, the superhero phenomenon Dispatch ), the founding members of AdHoc Studio were originally working on a new Splinter Cell game.

The problem, for PC gamers at least, is that Madness Returns has a pretty rough port that's only gotten harder to work with since its release in 2011; until now, anyway. Modder Wemino has undertaken the noble task of brushing up the port themselves, and released the initial build of their custom MadnessPatch Friday. It's remarkably feature-rich for a fanmade patch: not only does it improve textures, force subtitles to scale correctly above 720p, and adjust the camera for ultrawide resolutions, it also addresses crashes, fixes up broken physics at high framerates, and helps the game run in windowed mode without it throwing a fit.

Metal Gear Solid really blew the doors down, but it's the 2D, 8-bit Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 for Japanese MSX computers where the series began. You can observe the beginnings of Hideo Kojima's signature style, particularly in Metal Gear 2, and these are the games that actually show Snake's battles with Big Boss⁠—as well as body double and MGS5 protagonist, Venom Snake⁠—that would reverberate for the rest of the series.

Even before big-budget studios were employing whole-ass orchestras to perform grand symphonies, composers were making full use of synthesizers and sound chips to create pieces that would've had Beethoven telling all his pals \"Have you heard that One Winged Angel? It's pretty good.\" Videogame music is home to so many bangers that it would be a huge disservice if they were forever confined to the games they were created for, which is where the humble videogame concert comes in. It's a chance to hear your favourite tracks brought to life by an in-person orchestra, often complemented by visuals from the game and maybe even a guest appearance from the composer themselves.
