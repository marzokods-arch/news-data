I can't imagine playing Diablo 4 without sanctification, a new crafting system that is technically exclusive to the season but shouldn't be because it's almost perfect. It is responsible for dramatically improving the core loop of the game in ways I wasn't really expecting after playing with an unfinished version on the test server a few months ago. Sanctification is essentially a way to gamble with items for a chance at extraordinary outcomes. You take a piece of gear to a special forge and roll the dice to see what new bonuses are added to them. And those bonuses aren't always some extra strength or maximum life; they can add effects from the best items in the game. A forgettable pair of gloves can become the most powerful gloves you've ever worn, if you're lucky enough. This means every piece of loot is an opportunity for something amazing.

Justin Theroux, who plays Robert House (one of the apparently two Robert Houses that have appeared in the show so far) may have just tipped us off to an exciting upcoming Fallout: New Vegas cameo. The revelation took place on the \"Fake Fallout Talkshow,\" which you'll find hidden on Prime TV's Fallout show page on the \"Extras\" tab. It's a short talk show—a fake one—hosted by comedian and actor Jon Daly as his \"Snake Oil Salesman\" character, the shady vagabond best known for having sex with chickens and giving Thaddeus the elixir that ghoulified him. There's some real Between Two Ferns energy to the fake show, with the Snake Oil Salesman asking inappropriate or insulting questions: in one episode, he asks Ella Purnell how much money she makes, and repeatedly badgers her about what it's like being on Stranger Things, a show she does not appear on.

I think KCD really fits into that trend.\" (Image credit: Warhorse Studios) So Warhorse isn't surprised we loved KCD2 as much as we did. Klima says the \"deep gaming audience\"—I think that's you and me—is getting older and more experienced, more prone to venture out beyond the familiar. \"In general, I think you can only eat so much popcorn,\" said Klima, \"and once you discover that there is more rarefied food available, then you are no longer so keen on popcorn.

Fallout 4 (Image credit: Bethesda Softworks) I devoured every episode of the Fallout TV series when it came out. After it wrapped up, all I wanted to do was head back into the Wasteland and explore to the dulcet sounds of The Ink Spots. Set in an irradiated Boston, you'll build settlements, kill Deathclaws, and befriend a cast of compelling companions, like our synth buddy Nick Valentine.

You can keep track of them yourself via the work of our diligent hardware team, but the rampant use of generative AI by big tech has led to such sharp increases, you could basically watch them climb in real time. This has also impacted Larian, of all people. That's per an interview with TheGamer , wherein Larian CEO Swen Vincke told the site that it's facing issues with \"the price of RAM and the price of SSDs and fuck, man. It's like, literally, we've never had it like this\". The problem is, it seems, the slow pace of game development—especially if you're Larian, you're going to be designing architecture for a game that'll be both simultaneously coming out in a few years but also releasing now, so figuring out a level of optimisation that's reasonable (while still making the thing look good) takes a bit of soothsaying. \"It kind of ruins all of your projections that you had about,\" he explains, \"because normally, you know the curves, and you can protect the hardware. It's gonna be an interesting one. It means that most likely, we already need to do a lot of optimization work in early access that we didn't necessarily want to do at that point in time.\" …",

Why? Crandall, who has worked at Kingston for 29 years, says the company is experiencing NAND wafer price spikes the likes of which have never been seen before. In conversation with Mark Hachman on The Full Nerd Network podcast , Crandall got specific, saying there's been \"a 246% increase in NAND pricing as compared to Q1 of 2025.\" He later goes on to elaborate, \"We just recently saw a 70% increase in NAND costs over… I think it was a 60-day period. So, that 250% I mentioned earlier—70% of that was increased within the last 60 days.\" As NAND flash chips make up about 90% of a single SSD's Bill of Materials cost, that's an especially eye-watering uptick for both businesses and general consumers alike. As such, Crandall offers a word of advice to anyone considering upgrading their rig's storage: \"Do it now and [don't] wait, because prices are going to continue to go up.\" In other words, we've yet to see just how high SSD prices can go.

And at first glance, a report that Nvidia is planning on cutting discrete GPU production by up to 40% just seems like a case in point. However, while it is all RAM-related, it's not necessarily bad tidings. The claim in question was posted on the Chinese Board Channels forum (via Benchlife and Overclock3D ) and basically claims that Nvidia is set to reduce the supply of its gaming GPUs by between 30% and 40% in the first half of 2026, compared to the volume of output during the same period in 2025. That's not surprising given that the DRAM supply problems, affecting the entire computing industry, will result in fewer desktop and laptop PCs being shipped next year. Given just how many of them typically sport an Nvidia discrete GPU, either soldered onto the motherboard or in the form of a third-party graphics card, the demand for RTX Blackwell chips is obviously going to plummet. However, there's not exactly a huge shortage of GeForce RTX 50-series cards at the moment, with the exception of sensibly priced RTX 5080 and 5090 models.…",

Maybe it's the sicko Destiny 2 player in me talking, but character fashion is properly important.

    "body": "Seems like everywhere you look there's a fresh scam on the hardware marketplace, and it's becoming increasingly difficult for even the most vigilant PC Gamer to avoid. Case in point, one unlucky shopper thought they were getting DDR5 RAM at a decent price, only to have sticks of DDR2 memory with shoddy printed labels mimicking DDR5 heatsinks turn up at their door. The shopper in question goes by the handle BravoNorris, and had scooped up the last four available XPG Caster 32 GB DDR5-6000 CL40 kits from Adata, each containing two sticks of 16 GB memory. All were sold as new and sealed from Amazon Spain. After selling one, and installing another, BravoNorris opened a third box only to find the sticker scam in their hand. That's when they reached out to VideoCardz with the story . This third box was plastic-wrapped like the other three, and had shipped from the same point of origin in Ireland. However, this box contained two old sticks of DDR2 memory with DDR5 heatsink stickers that could fool someone only checking the product through the packaging window. BravoNorris also found a small plate of metal inside the box, likely placed to account for the weight discrepancy. As such, what'…",

Good news to anyone in the former group: Arctic has just launched a new paste, and some suggest it's one of the best. Arctic's MX-7 is a non-conductive and highly viscous paste. A higher viscosity than MX-6 but not as viscous as MX-4. I'll stop saying viscous now. The company suggests it can lower CPU temperatures by as much as a couple of degrees versus MX-6 in its own testing, though we have a third-party test to take a look at in a moment. MX-7 is already available to purchase in a variety of sizes. I'd normally round prices, but since we're talking pennies between some of these sizes, here they are in full: 8 gram - $8.59 4 gram - $7.39 4 gram with cleaning wipes - $9.59 2 gram - $6.89 Why you'd buy anything other than 8 grams with these sorts of prices is beyond me. Grab some isopropyl and a big tube, and you're sorted for cleaning and reapplication for years to come. Arctic recommends a cross pattern for applying MX-7. Who am I to go against the company that makes the paste—nah, I'm still going to do a big line down the middle. You can't teach an old dog new tricks. Generally…",

It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions,\" he says. In mitigation, Enzor-DeMeo also says that the AI element in Firefox will be optional. \"First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off,\" Enzor-DeMeo explains. While Mozilla says that the transition to AI will be a three-year process, it's also clear that they don't plan to hang about. \"We will move with urgency. AI is changing software. Browsers are becoming the control point for digital life. Regulation is shifting defaults. These shifts play to Mozilla’s strengths,\" Enzor-DeMeo goes on.

As you can find out for yourself by opening Steam and clicking the big \" Steam Replay \" button on the storefront, the percentage playtime spent by all Steam users in 2025 on games, released in the same year, was 14%. Valve doesn't share its exact working, here, but I'm happy to assume that the company makes an effort to bar completely inactive accounts in these tallies, because Steam's been kicking for over 22 years at this point—if it didn't, that number would be a lot smaller. I'm also made more reasonably confident by the fact that this is a pattern that's held (somewhat) stable for four years now—with only one outlier in 2023. As we noted last year , the historical data for this same statistic are as follows: Players spent 17% of their time on same-year releases in 2022… 9% in 2023 and 15% in 2024. With 14% of players doing so in 2025, it's starting to become a safe bet to assume that number will, on your average calendar year, hang around the 15% mark. As far a…",

While there is a spare key you can grab on the way, it has a similar problem to Armored Transports—the one quest I have still not completed for this very reason. If you lose the key, it's basically up to RNG whether you get another, so you're a bit stuck. Luckily, the locked room at Pilgrim's Peak, where you have to go, has a lot more foot traffic, so chances are even without the key, you'll still be able to get it. No free loadout this time; you'll want a safe pocket to stow the key Apollo gives you until you need to use it. Otherwise, here's how to complete Groundbreaking, including where to find the locked room, and how to find the building pictured on the whiteboard.

But right off the bat in Fallout Season 2, Episode 1, we get to see a location I remember fondly from one of the Fallout games—and surprisingly, it has absolutely nothing to do with New Vegas at all. Thinking about it, this location is probably the place I've spent the most time out of all of the Fallout games I've played. When it showed up in the episode, I immediately got a buffout-sized dose of nostalgia. As the kids say, it hit me right in the feels. (Apologies if the kids no longer say this.) In Episode 1, Lucy and the Ghoul are following Hank's bloody footprints through the desert from California to Nevada, and they discover he made a stop at a location players of Fallout 4 are sure to recognize: the Starlight Drive-In Theatre.

Case in point: Hank MacLean, played by Kyle MacLachlan in Prime Video's Fallout series. Hank is the ultimate business zealot. Before the bombs fell, Hank was so dedicated to his work at Vault-Tec that he voluntarily had himself cryogenically frozen for a couple centuries. He got thawed out, married a Vault-dweller named Rose, had two kids, and then murdered 30,000 people with an A-bomb. All in the name of business. And he was just getting started! In the final episode of Season 1, Hank saw his daughter learn what a monster he was, left her behind to mercy-kill her ghoulified mother, then stomped his way across the desert to reach New Vegas. As Season 2 begins we see that Hank has not been shattered by the consequences of his evil acts: he's actually invigorated and ready for more. Discovering that the front desk at Vault-Tec has collected over 400,000 unread messages over the past two centuries actually b…",

Rex, and one of the most mysterious cut locations from Fallout: New Vegas . I'm of course talking about Vault 24. Over the course of Fallout's life, there have been many iconic Vaults mentioned and featured in games. Many were the childhood homes of our protagonists and player characters—like Lucy's own Vault 33, or Vault 13 from the OG Fallout. But the vaults run the gamut from capsules of Americana to harrowing psychological experiments. Here are just some of the more interesting examples: Vault 4 (TV Show): In season 1, we saw Lucy and Maximus explore Vault 4, the previous home of a group of scientists who experimented with mutants and Wastelanders. Vault 11 (New Vegas): A social experiment took place to see how willing people would be to sacrifice others for the safety of the majority.

The topic came up in a recent interview with IGN , and Howard was pretty clear it's a 'no' from him: \"They've offered me a whole bunch, even in Season 1,\" says Howard. \"I was going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things. I think I'm best behind the camera.” Spoiler alert for Season 1, obviously. This scene is one of the revelations that occurs towards the end of that season, and is a flashback to how Vault-Tec executives and various other business big-hitters divide the various vault experiments between themselves before they agree to drop the bombs. Having Howard in there would've seemed like a pretty neat nod to me, but perhaps an executive from a company owned by Microsoft participating in a corporate carve-up to humanity's detriment would've been too on-the-nose.

Distressed elves seem to spawn at random intervals, but you'll be notified they're out there with an \"elves have appeared around the map\" announcement at the start of a new day.

By provoking controversy, Horses has clearly done part of its job as a work of art, although after playing it, I was disappointed that it didn't fully take advantage of its potential as a game. It's visually strong and thematically coherent, and a fascinating attempt to explore topics and tones in games that have often been reserved for film, but it struggles to integrate the experience of the player in a way that doesn't distract from its point. The horses are people, if you hadn't noticed yet In Horses, you play a young man, Anselmo, who's sent to stay and work for two weeks on a farm. The farm is populated mainly by naked humans wearing horse masks. Bad things happen on the farm. To be extremely blunt about Horses' themes: this is an intentionally disturbing game about fear, repression, inherited violence, and societal control.

AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node.

    "body": "Fallout Season 2 is about to drop on us like an A-bomb (here's how to watch it , with a note that Episode 1 is arriving earlier than expected ). Some lucky ducks, however—PC Gamer included—have already seen the first six episodes of Prime TV's eight-episode season. Our verdict is already in: Weekend/AU Editor Jody MacGregor was worried that Season 2 couldn't live up to the first season, but wasn't disappointed. \"Fallout hasn't simplified itself for second-screen viewers—it's still a show you need to pay attention to keep up with, and more importantly it's a show worth paying attention to,\" he says in his Fallout Season 2 review . \"The first season was full of great bits where the stars were absent, when it bounced back to Norm or over to Wilzig and Thaddeus and all the rest,\" Jody says. \"Season 2 carries on some of those stories—Norm continues to be a highlight—and introduces new ones, like what Hank's actually up to in Vegas, which are as interesting as the activities of the core trio.\" Even the fan service is handled well: \"I imagine someone has a list of 'things that happen in Fallout games' with 'be addicted to chems' written on it near 'get a rocket-assisted super sledge',\" J…",

You'll also have to find the underground tunnels in the Spaceport and then activate a terminal with the Flushing Terminal Key afterwards. I'll run through all the steps below. You can bring a free loadout to this if you want, considering even if you die and lose the key, you should be able to get it again since all the quest has to be completed in one round.

But there are some frustrating oversimplifications, some notable omissions and at least one example of unforgivable marketing nonsense involving Microsoft's Copilot+ PC standard. Titled \" How to optimize your gaming PC setup ,\" the guide touches on most key hardware issues, albeit with one fairly obvious omission. It kicks off with CPU and GPU recommendations. Frankly, an actually useful guide to all the currently available CPU and GPU options would make for a lengthy dissertation on its own. So Microsoft boils it down, thus: Entry-level gaming (1080p, medium settings) CPU: At least a modern quad-core like AMD Ryzen 5 5600 or Intel Core i5-12400 GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1660 Super or AMD Radeon RX 6600 Mid-range gaming (1440p, high settings) CPU: 6-core or better, such as AMD Ryzen 5 7600 or Intel Core i5-13600K GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti / 4060 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT High-end/4K gaming CPU: 8-core or better, like AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D or Intel Core i7-13700K GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4080 or AMD Rade…",

Sure, it's expensive and difficult to get used to, but if you can afford one and commit to its steep learning curve, I reckon it's one of the very best ergonomic keyboards around. So when ZSA offered to send over its Voyager keyboard, along with its new Navigator trackball module, I had high expectations. Essentially, the Voyager is a pared-down Moonlander, with all excess fat trimmed away to leave as minimal a keyboard as possible. \"Laptop-friendly,\" says ZSA's marketing. \"Goes anywhere—on your desk or on the road.\" I certainly can't argue with that because with just 52 keys and a total thickness of just 16 mm (0.62 inches), the Voyager is as whisper-thin as you could want. However, both the thickness and key count result in some notable compromises. For example, there's no wireless connectivity option because batteries would add to the weight, cost, and size of the keyboard. With such few keys, you have to make full use of the Voyager's layer system to access standard options such as function keys. On the plus side, the ZSA Voyager comes with multiple USB cables of…",

It's more pressure,\" he said. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing,\" Vincke added. Vincke has previously admitted that Larian planned to work on another D&D game following Baldur's Gate 3 ; ultimately the team wasn't excited about spending years working on a sequel and pivoted to a new project, which we now know was Divinity. There will still be similarities between BG3 and Divinity—Larian confirmed it's sticking to turn-based combat—but if you think that means developing its next intricate RPG will be easier, you'd be wrong. Larian was wrong, too. \"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this.'

It feels a little K-Pop Demon Hunters in tone, and I'm definitely interested to see what other tracks People of Note has tucked under its belt. That's partly because Jason Charles Miller—a name you'll most certainly recognise if you're as Final Fantasy 14-brained as I am, vocalist behind tracks like To The Edge and Close in the Distance—is the co-writer behind nine of the songs in People of Note.

We first reviewed the RTX 3060 way back in February 2021 . So, it's had an exceptionally long run of nearly five years.
