These screening systems are designed to stop people from purchasing genetic sequences that could be used to create deadly toxins or pathogens. But now researchers led by Microsoft’s chief scientist, Eric Horvitz, says they have figured out how to bypass the protections in a way previously unknown to defenders.&nbsp; The team described its work today in the journal Science . Horvitz and his team focused on generative AI algorithms that propose new protein shapes. These types of programs are already fueling the hunt for new drugs at well-funded startups like Generate Biomedicines and Isomorphic Labs, a spinout of Google.&nbsp; The problem is that such systems are potentially “dual use.” They can use their training sets to generate both beneficial molecules and harmful ones. Microsoft says it began a “red-teaming” test of AI’s dual-use potential in 2023 in order to determine whether “adversarial AI protein design” could help bioterrorists manufacture harmful proteins.&nbsp; The safeguard that Microsoft attacked is wh…",

A record 58% of S&amp;P 500 companies mentioned AI in their second-quarter earnings calls, according to Goldman Sachs. But it’s difficult to walk the talk. Just 5% of generative AI pilots are driving measurable profit-and-loss impact, according to a recent MIT study . That means 95% of generative AI pilots are realizing zero return, despite significant attention and investment. Although we’re nearly three years past the watershed moment of ChatGPT’s public release, the vast majority of organizations are stalling out in AI. Something is broken. What is it? Date from Lucid’s AI readiness survey sheds some light on the tripwires that are making organizations stumble. Fortunately, solving these problems doesn’t require recruiting top AI talent worth hundreds of millions of dollars, at least for most companies. Instead, as they race to implement AI quickly and successfully, leaders need to bring greater rigor and structure to their operational processes.

    "body": "This is today&#8217;s edition of The Download , our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology. OpenAI is huge in India. Its models are steeped in caste bias. Caste bias is rampant in OpenAI’s products, including ChatGPT, according to an MIT Technology Review investigation. Though CEO Sam Altman boasted about India being its second-largest market during the launch of GPT-5 in August, we found that both this new model, which now powers ChatGPT, as well as Sora, OpenAI’s text-to-video generator, exhibit caste bias. This risks entrenching discriminatory views in ways that are currently going unaddressed. Mitigating caste bias in AI models is more pressing than ever. In contemporary India, many caste-oppressed Dalit people have escaped poverty and have become doctors, civil service officers, and scholars; some have even risen to become the president of India. But AI models continue to reproduce socioeconomic and occupational stereotypes that render Dalits as dirty, poor, and performing only menial jobs.

So he turned to ChatGPT. He was surprised to see that in addition to smoothing out his language, it changed his identity—swapping out his surname for “Sharma,” which is associated with privileged high-caste Indians. Though his application did not mention his last name, the chatbot apparently interpreted the “s” in his email address as Sharma rather than Singha, which signals someone from the caste-oppressed Dalits. “The experience [of AI] actually mirrored society,” Singha says.&nbsp; Singha says the swap reminded him of the sorts of microaggressions he’s encountered when dealing with people from more privileged castes. Growing up in a Dalit neighborhood in West Bengal, India, he felt anxious about his surname, he says. Relatives would discount or ridicule his ambition of becoming a teacher, implying that Dalits were unworthy of a job intended for privileged castes. Through education, Singha overcame the internalized shame, becoming a first-generation college graduate in his family. Over time he learned to …",

    "body": "In Seattle, a meteorologist analyzes dynamic atmospheric models to predict the next major storm system. In Stuttgart, an automotive engineer examines crash-test simulations&nbsp;for vehicle safety&nbsp;certification. And in Singapore, a financial analyst&nbsp;simulates portfolio stress tests&nbsp;to hedge against global&nbsp;economic shocks.&nbsp; Each of these professionals—and the consumers, commuters, and investors who depend on their insights— relies on a time-tested pillar of high-performance computing: the humble CPU.&nbsp; DOWNLOAD THE REPORT With GPU-powered AI breakthroughs getting the lion’s share of press (and investment) in 2025, it is tempting to assume that CPUs are yesterday’s news. Recent predictions anticipate that GPU and accelerator installations will increase by 17% year over year through 2030. But, in reality, CPUs are still responsible for the vast majority of today’s most cutting-edge scientific, engineering, and research workloads. Evan Burness, who leads Microsoft Azure’s HPC and AI product teams, estimates that CPUs still support 80% to 90% of HPC simulation jobs today. In 2025, not only are these systems far from obsolete, they are experiencing a technol…",

CPUs still handle 80% to 90% of HPC workloads globally, powering everything from climate modeling to semiconductor design. Far from being eclipsed, they’re evolving in ways that make them more competitive, flexible, and indispensable than ever. The competitive landscape around CPUs has intensified. Once dominated almost exclusively by Intel’s x86 chips, the market now includes powerful alternatives based on ARM and even emerging architectures like RISC-V. Flagship examples like Japan’s Fugaku supercomputer demonstrate how CPU innovation is pushing performance to new frontiers. Meanwhile, cloud providers like Microsoft and AWS are developing their own silicon, adding even more diversity to the ecosystem. What makes CPUs so enduring? Flexibility, compatibility, and cost efficiency are key. As Evan Burness of Microsoft Azure points out, CPUs remain the “it-just-works” technology. Moving complex, proprietary code to GPUs can be an expensive and time-consuming effort, while CPUs typically support software continuity acros…",
