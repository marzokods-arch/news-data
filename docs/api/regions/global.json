And in a recent interview, CEO Lisa Su tells us that one such choice was betting almost everything on chiplets. The interview took place on Reid Hoffman's YouTube channel , a venture capitalist and co-founder of LinkedIn, amongst many other strings to his bow. The two hosts chatted with AMD's CEO, Dr Lisa Su, about her past and what led her to become a chip engineer, as well as all things AI, of course. For me, the most interesting part was when Su talked about AMD's decision-making process, which ultimately led to the likes of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D being the most sought-after CPU by PC gamers. \"We were in a place where the world in semiconductors, for 30 years, really was driven by Moore's law—the idea that every two years or every 18 months you could double the productivity—and so it was all about scaling, scaling, scaling, scaling.

Specifically, it's introduced a new free trial system for its premium accounts, which it's somehow gone without since introducing subscriptions all the way back in 2007. It is, it must be said, a bit of a miserly trial. No full week here, instead you get just three days to enjoy all the fruits of premium, after which it's either pay up or sling your hook. You can choose a trial for both Nexus' monthly and yearly plans. Just to be clear, the only difference there is whether it charges you for a month or a year when the trial ends if you don't cancel. You'll also need to enter valid card details to make it all work. You've done this dance before—it's how free trials work pretty much anywhere else online. What does Nexus premium actually get you? Well, the number one feature as far as I'm concerned is uncapped download speeds. As it stands, Nexus users who use an adblocker can download at a mere 1.5MB/s.

    "body": "While repkits are your main source of healing in Borderlands 4 , legendary repkits like the Triple Bypass turn them into offensive tools. Sometimes, though, you do just want some healing, and the Kill Spring does just that in spades. This legendary repkit keeps you at full health thanks to seeking healing orbs. That might sound a little boring, but it's the perfect addition to glass cannon builds or those with skills that give you bonuses based on your health. Like the Bod legendary shotgun, it's a bit of a pain to get though, so here's what you need to do. How to get the Kill Spring in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get the Kill Spring legendary repkit from the Axemaul boss at the end of the Toil of Spoiling Vis mine, in the centre of Dominion's Carcadia District , near The Lockaway safehouse. To unlock the Dominion region, you must first complete all three outer regions' main missions: Fadefields, Terminus Range, and Carcadia Burn. Just progress the campaign and you'll eventually enter Dominion—it'll take upwards of 25 hours, if not more, for most players. When you do finally unlock Dominion, it'll be through the C…",

However, if a purported idea being considered by the Trump administration comes to fruition, they will all need to massively reduce imports and switch to locally-made chips to avoid being hit with a fresh tariff. That's according to a report by the Wall Street Journal , which claims that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has already mooted the idea with various executives within America's semiconductor industry. If we use Nvidia as an example, it currently relies almost exclusively on companies outside of the US for all the chips and other electronic components that are used to manufacture its graphics cards and AI data servers. Its GPUs and CPUs are made by TSMC in Taiwan, with circuit boards and the host of parts that are fitted to them produced in China.

Origins is essentially Habbo Hotel's answer to WoW Classic—a stripped-back version of the social MMO that's closer to its original browser days than… whatever NFT nonsense it was touting around back when that was a thing. It's described as \"Habbo as it was in 2005, lovingly restored,\" launching last summer as a standalone launcher for PC.

Sometimes the games I'm torn between are very similar; this is not one of those times. As for the nitty-gritty balance changes: The Ippy Slide (a quite frankly horsecrap option that let dribblers clown on defenders without much counterplay) is dead and buried, and SloClap's \"reduced how quickly players can snap to the ball while using extra effort\" so that volleys are a smidge weaker. There's also a 3v3 ranked matchmaking mode—though I'm not entirely sure this was the play. There's no current option to queue for both 3v3s and 5v5s at the same time, meaning you're gonna be splitting your playerbase in two.

It's technically a legendary shotgun, sitting alongside greats like the Hot Slugger , Hellwalker , Rainbow Vomit , and Convergence , but it's also everything . The Bod's whole deal is that it counts as a shotgun, assault rifle, sniper, pistol, and SMG all at once. As for why that's somehow incredibly useful, I'll get into that later, as it's quite build-dependent. Unfortunately, it'll take you at least around 20 hours before you can get the Bod as it's in the final region you'll unlock. So, here's where you need to go to unlock this legendary shotgun. How to get the Bod in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get the Bod from the Axemaul boss at the end of the Toil of Spoiling Vis mine, in the centre of Dominion's Carcadia District , near The Lockaway safehouse . If you're wondering where this is, it's the Timekeeper's city at the centre of the map, which you'll unlock after completing all three outer regions' stories: Fadefields, Terminus Range, and Carcadia Burn.

Called Uprising, it seems like RGG Studio's attempt at delving into a more modern fighting game formula with \"dynamic momentum-shifting opportunities,\" according to the presentation. These opportunities come in the form of new mechanics Flowguard, Break and Rush, and the Stunner and Stun Combo systems. The first is a \"new defensive system designed with stylish movements,\" which RGG Studio says \"expands options and introduces fresh dynamics for offense and defense beyond traditional guarding.\" Flowguard's defensive options are closely tied to Break and Rush, which seems to be the main selling point behind Uprising. It's essentially a part break system—repeatedly damaging the same body parts—like the head, body, and legs—will eventually open up huge vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to gain access to \"powerful offensive o…",

Although the technology will initially be limited to the Asus ROG Xbox Ally handhelds and games purchased through the Xbox app, an update to Agility SDK means that other vendors and merchants can now get started on supporting it too. Microsoft's Agility software development kit (SDK) is a collection of tools that game developers can use to implement the latest DirectX features, without having to wait for them to be integrated into Windows itself. In the latest 1.618 version, Agility now supports Advanced Shader Delivery, which was announced last month . The rather unassuming name is for a complex database system that will hopefully be the ultimate solution to all problems relating to shader compilation. Modern 3D graphics involve tens of thousands of different shaders, and APIs such as DirectX, Vulkan, or Metal generate them in a common format. For your graphics card to be able to process them, they need to be compiled specifically for that hardware. For gaming PCs, that process is carried out by the GPU drivers, a…",

This is not, despite what my enemies might tell you, because I'm very scared of its many difficult bosses, but is in fact because I'm a man of stalwart principle. The monsters at Team Cherry removed Hornet's shaw. In the original Hollow Knight, Hornet was a chatty sort. During her boss encounter, she'd flit about the stage barking classic lines like \"Shaw!\" and \"Haa!\" and \"Adino!\" and \"Hegale!\" But in Silksong, where she's the protagonist, she's a rather taciturn sort. Which is a crime. But that crime has now been rectified: a modder named Nai has created HK Hornet Voice Restored (via GamesRadar ), happily restoring our heroine's barks. Now, your many attacks will be accompanied by all the hegales and adinos you could dream of. Which is, ah, maybe a bit annoying, actually? This might get me blacklisted for life, but if there's one thing I've taken from HK Hornet Voice Restored, it's that actually Team Cherry might have had a reason for yoinking her voice away when players are in control of her. Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled that anyone who wants to play with these voicelines can, but I think I've learnt a valuable lesson about gett…",

    "body": "Often, there's no unique selling point to a gaming mouse: it either offers good quality for a great price, or it doesn't. But occasionally, there's something new enough about a mouse, or something that it does well enough, to give it that very definite selling point stamp, and I think that's the case here with the Corsair Sabre V2 Pro. I already wrote about this upon its launch, but the Sabre V2 Pro Ultralight Wireless feels like a significant leap forward for mainstream lightweight gaming mice, just like the original Logitech G Pro X Superlight was way back in 2020/2021. That's because it's seriously light and it hasn't been poked full of a million little holes. I remember when I first used the G Pro X Superlight and was impressed by the fact that it weighed only 63 g and was still full-bodied and felt very sturdy. 63 g is old news these days, but flip those digits around and you can impress me once again. That's what the Sabre V2 Pro has done. Some won't get the appeal of an ultralight gaming mouse, and that's fair enough. I think there's definitely something to be said for the argument that the lighter a mouse is, the flimsier and cheaper it can feel, even if the materials are …",

The only wildcard, each commanding officer's slow-charging heroic power, can swing the tide of a battle but is still relatively tame—like gaining a couple extra tiles of range on artillery strikes for one pivotal turn. Give a small team of brilliant game designers the remit to make chess with toy soldiers, and I think this is what they would come up with. And yet it is not my favorite Advance Wars. My favorite, Advance Wars: Dual Strike for the Nintendo DS, is more the Chess 2 of strategy games. More units, more powers, combining those wildcard bursts in ways that drag matches out into dizzying swingy battles like games of Risk where someone's turning in their bonus cards every freaking turn . Forget perfect: I loved the bombast of Dual Strike being messily over-the-top, and on a visit to indie studio Area 35's Tokyo office ahead of TGS this week I immediately clocked that its new entry in the Tiny Metal series takes after my one true love.

From the looks of it, Petit Planet gives us all a little corner of the galaxy to decorate and nourish. Over time, new neighbors show up and shape the world with you. Their friendship impacts how your planet grows, and you'll do all of the day-to-day basics like gardening, crafting, and decorating while seeing your little cosmic community thrive. Petit Planet release date details and speculation (Image credit: HoYoverse) Does Petit Planet have a release date? No, there's no release date for Petit Planet yet. HoYoverse hasn't even given us a general window yet, so all we can do is speculate and look at some of the developer's historical timelines. Its more recent games, like Honkai: Star Rail and Zenless Zone Zero, saw around two years between their first reveal trailers and their release dates.

I would cackle as the onesie-ed, erstwhile binge watcher slid haplessly down muddy slopes in the least dignified way possible. Sometimes I would just stand still and rotate the analog stick so that he'd do that weird whooshing wormy dance that looks so pathetic. It's fun to make Nate do dumb things and laugh at him. And get a load of his stupid walk. What an absolute loser! If you can imagine, it gets much darker than this. Baby Steps is the bleakest game I've ever played. Before being transported to a bizarre mountainous landscape full of illogical obstacles and donkey men with laddish Australian accents, Nate is a 35-year-old man living in his parents' basement.

You will be able to preorder both the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X as of today, with the standard Ally fetching $600 and the Xbox Ally X costing $1,000. The cheaper of the two devices, the white $600 ROG Xbox Ally comes with a Ryzen Z2 A processor, which offers eight RDNA 2 cores and a boost frequency of up to 1800 MHz. This is almost the same as the Steam Deck , which comes in at half the price, and benefits from the lightweight, Linux-based SteamOS. Not a good start for Microsoft. Up next is the black ROG Xbox Ally X, which has the new Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip in it and comes in at $1,000. This chip was recently benchmarked against the Z1 Extreme , which you will find in the still rather great original ROG Ally X. Despite the upgrade to three Zen 5 and five Zen 5c cores (as opposed to eight Zen 4), the Z2 Extreme only sees a performance uplift of 12% in Cyberpunk 2077 with both machines at 25 W.

The top-spec ROG Xbox Ally X , meanwhile, is $1,000. Sorry, what? Lest you have forgotten, the basic ROG Xbox Ally runs AMD's \"new\" AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip. Entirely contrary to the implications of the \"Z2\" branding, this is a very elderly SoC indeed. The Z2 A rocks four AMD Zen 2-era CPU cores and eight RDNA 2 graphics compute units. Sounds familiar? It sure does, because those are exactly the same details as the Van Gogh APU (Aerith) in OG Steam Deck circa 2022 and also the die-shrunk version of the same chip in the Steam Deck OLED (Sephiroth) . Of course, Valve has just cut the price of the basic 256 GB LCD Deck to a mere $319 . So, that's twice the price for precisely no additional gaming performance, if you go with the ROG Xbox Ally. Great. For the record, in the UK, that's £499 for the ROG Xbox Ally and £279 for the Deck. Doesn't look much better, does it?

If that weren't enough, its $30 price tag ($26 for preorders) only looks more ridiculous when you consider that the entire mainline series⁠—Deus Ex, Invisible War, Human Revolution, and Mankind Divided⁠— can be had for less than $10 on Steam ⁠. I'm not including Mankind Divided's throwaway DLC or the port of dumpy tablet prequel The Fall in this calculation. Sorry to all five Deus Ex: The Fall fans. The announcement of Deus Ex Remastered made me very sad, a moment of genuine joy and surprise immediately deflated by the piece of work on offer. No one sets out to make a bad game, but I wonder what led to its seemingly sorry state, and if anyone at Aspyr, Eidos Montreal, or Embracer is surprised at the response. It looks like Deus Ex remade in its 2004 sequel, Invisible War, a \"what-if\" Doom 3 mod recreation of the levels, or, indeed, if the the infamous, long-dead Project HDTP was unleashed like a mummy's curse⁠—HDTP may have a genuine claim to being the first laughably bad retro game \"HD texture\" rework.

It debuted the following year with multiplayer maps for Return to Castle Wolfenstein —which, for the record, were excellent. That focus continued through projects including the Enemy Territory games, Brink , Dirty Bomb , and the multiplayer components of Gears of War 4 and Gears 5 . Chinese holding company Leyou acquired Splash Damage in 2016, and was then acquired itself by Tencent in 2020, which is how Splash Damage got there.

Initially, you only have a 20% chance of flipping heads. This is, as the name suggests, unfair. (Image credit: Heather Flowers) It will likely take thousands of flips, and you'll have to manually click for each one. Thankfully, flipping heads rewards you with money. With that money, you can purchase upgrades, increasing the coin's value, your flip speed, your cash combo multiplier, and—crucially—increasing your chance of flipping heads. As the game itself tells you, \"this is the entire game.\" You flip, and then you upgrade your flips, and then you flip until you win. But Unfair Flips isn't really about flipping heads, or incrementally upgrading your odds and income, or stacking combo multipliers for a jolt of post-Balatro dopamine. Unfair Flips is a game about negotiating the temptations of superstition. (Image credit: Heather Flowers) It's a game about the human mind's instinctive drive to find meaning where there is n…",

The update has sparked a new round of performance complaints, though, as quite a few players are reporting that instead of being improved, their in-game performance is worse than ever. One of the less-great things about PC gaming is that the nigh-infinite number of potential hardware configurations means that somebody, somewhere, is always going to have problems with a new game launch or update. In this case, though, the problems seem fairly widespread, with reports of diminished frame rates and increased stuttering coming in on Steam , Reddit , and X alike. Some users do say they've seen an improvement in frame rates, or at least that things are more or less the same.

The Vanguard 96 range is giving me some serious deja vu, in part because the foundations of its design are very similar to the K70 series of keebs (and I reviewed the Corsair K70 Pro TKL last March). For instance, these keebs enjoy the same MGX Hyperdrive Hall effect switches that also featured in that earlier K70 range.

The trick to gathering the emas is to look for the odd one out; all the other wrong emas will repeat throughout the alleyways, and knowing that you won't find them in the order that they come in on the clue page, then it's smooth sailing. Unless you're playing on Lost in the Fog level difficulty, then you have a whole world of pain in the form of a confusing riddle waiting for you—godspeed.

With the launch of the new 500+ , Raspberry is hoping to attract even more computing hobbyists to the fray, though what one modder has managed to achieve already suggests that its appeal could be even bigger than expected. The Raspberry Pi 500+ is a fairly decent update on the previous Pi 500 , changing the basic keyboard for an RGB-toting mechanical setup, doubling the system RAM from eight to 16 GB of LPDDR4x, and fitting an NVMe M.2 slot to the Pi 5's circuit board. This last aspect is the point of note here, because of what software engineer and modder Jeff Geerling chose to do with it. Rather than use it for the intended addition of a small SSD, Geerling took advantage of the fact that the M.2 slot is just a physical interface for a PCI Express connection. That means, with the help of an appropriate adapter, you can stuff pretty much any PCIe device into that slot, and the Pi 500+ should recognise it. In Geerling's case, the stuffing comprised an OCuLink cable, an external GPU dock, a Radeon RX 7900 XT , and a mere 15 lines of ad…",

It's primarily an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, where the masked killer Michael Myers hunts down four residents, though this time around there will also be a singleplayer component recreating scenes from the film. This seems to be very much the OG Halloween, with no nods to the many sequels in the first trailer (though I could've well missed some), and is I believe the first game based on the film since a curious Atari version from 1983.

The selling point here is its 'InfinitePlay' hot swappable battery system.
