While NVIDIA still isn’t ready to publicly commit to a new Shield TV, the company has started sharing a little about what a hypothetical new box might change. One big focus could be better hardware support for modern codecs. There are maybe three kinds of Android TV users out there. We’ve got our Google fans, who will go with a device like the Google TV Streamer largely because — much like Pixel users with their phones — they want first look at all of Google’s latest features. Then we’ve got the budget crowd who just wants to find the most affordable streaming solution around. But then, there are the power users. They want hardware with versatile ports, the performance to game on their TVs , and they want to buy from a company that’s going to follow through with software support. And for a long, long time, that’s meant pretty much one option: NVIDIA Shield TV . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Marsalis will continue to serve as artistic director through the 2026–27 season, the organization said, after which he’ll remain on staff in an advisory role through June 2028. He will also continue to serve on JALC’s board of directors and perform with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra on occasion. The transition marks a significant milestone for the organization Marsalis founded in 1987, when he was already a multi-Grammy winner at just 26 years old.

That multiple refers to how many times net label share and net publisher’s share (a.k.a. gross profit) can be divided into the valuation price. While publishing deals usually carry a higher multiple than master‑recording royalties, that gap has been narrowing in recent years. Today, music assets generally trade — depending on the catalog’s heritage and the rights involved — in a 12‑ to 18‑times‑multiple range, though superstar artists and songwriters have been known to achieve above 20‑times multiples.

The DSN also provides radar and radio astronomy observations that improve our understanding of the solar system and the larger universe. Through&nbsp;Artemis, NASA is establishing an enduring presence in space and exploring more of the Moon than ever before. To achieve this, Artemis missions rely on both the Deep Space Network and the Near Space Network . These networks, with oversight by NASA’s SCaN ( Space Communications and Navigation ) Program office, use global infrastructure and relay satellites to ensure seamless communications and tracking as Orion launches, orbits Earth, travels to the Moon, and returns home.

Nitrogen, Earth’s biosphere The study , published in Nature Communications on Jan. 22 , focuses on a type of metabolism called nitrogen fixation, or diazotrophy. This process is what converts biologically unusable nitrogen in Earth’s atmosphere into molecules that all living organisms use to survive. On Earth, there is a select group of organisms called diazotrophs that can perform nitrogen fixation. This group is a motley crew of bacteria (and a few archaea and eukaryotes) that are found dotted across different branches of the tree of life. Some diazotrophs are free-living organisms tha…",

Sure, it was probably a little too expensive, but the hardware felt brilliant, and I finally figured out how to use a device like this as a regular phone, which kind of justified the whole experience. Now, though, I think Samsung has jumped the shark. Its Galaxy Z TriFold is as ambitious as its price is eye-watering, and I don’t see how anyone can justify buying one at launch. Here’s why I’d rather exercise a boatload of caution.",

Maybe you got started swapping out your old lights for some fun new voice-controlled bulbs with a full spectrum of RGB colors. Or maybe you set up that doorbell cam to let you know when deliveries arrive. For my money, though, one of the most impactful, easiest, and affordable upgrades can be a smart lock — no more carrying around keys (and worrying about losing them), simple to grant access to guests, and a nice, logged record of your comings and goings. Nuki has already been a great option there for users in Europe with its Smart Lock Ultra , and now it’s bringing its Smart Lock to the US. I tested it out for a few months to see how it holds up.",

My Google Home setup is limited to a glorified kitchen timer; I don’t have the patience to set up light routines or safely store offline camera footage. I own a few pieces of connected kit; my robot vacuum cleaner seems harmless enough, and I’ve even hesitantly installed a smart thermostat to cut my energy bill and keep my house warmer. But that’s it. One line I’ve certainly never dared to cross is installing a smart lock on my door. I can’t convince myself of the benefits over a good old-fashioned key, especially given some pretty reasonable concerns about service outages or somehow locking myself out of my home (though I have managed that with a regular key, to be fair).

The Find N6 foldable could come in Orange and Titanium colors. 2026 could be a big year for OPPO, as the company is widely rumored to be launching several of its top Android flagships globally. This includes not only its foldable flagship, the Find N6, but a wider foldable expected to be called the Find N7 , as well as phones like the Find X9s and Find X9 Ultra in its flagship lineup. As we inch toward these launches, a new leak sheds more light on the colors we can expect on some of these phones, as well as their global release timelines.

More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

The feature uses Gemini to generate video essays from various sources. Infographics also get a boost on NotebookLM’s mobile apps. NotebookLM is undoubtedly beneficial for anyone who relies on extensive research, manages large volumes of study material, or simply wants to consume information more easily . Its generative features especially make learning fun and engaging by creating podcasts , videos, or infographics using Gemini. Google is now making these NotebookLM features more accessible to users by bringing them to mobile apps. With a new update, Google is expanding NotebookLM’s Video Overview to its mobile apps for Android and iOS. That means you can ask NotebookLM to generate AI videos that summarize any source material supplied using the mobile app.",

If you saw an SOS icon instead of your usual 5G bars last Wednesday, you probably felt cut off from the digital world. Verizon has since fixed the problem and restored service , but the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now starting its own probe. Regulators have officially launched an investigation into the 10-hour blackout that sidelined millions of customers and, more critically, potentially blocked access to 911. On the afternoon of January 14, Verizon’s wireless voice, text, and data services failed for users across the country. Outage reports quickly rose on trackers like Downdetector, reaching hundreds of thousands in just a few hours. Many customers saw only the SOS icon instead of signal bars, which meant they could still call emergency services, but regular calls and data did not work.",

Rugged phones are rarely shy about excess, but 8849’s Tank X pushes the envelope. Alongside its oversized battery and reinforced frame, the phone adds an unusual headline feature: a built-in 1080p projector. The integrated DLP projector displays a 1920×1080 Full HD image at around 220 lumens, and supports keystone correction and laser auto-focus up to roughly 4 meters, helping keep projections sharp and properly aligned with minimal manual adjustment. While it’s certainly not going to replace your TV, it’s a notable step up from the dim, novelty projectors previously attached to smartphones, and one that could prove genuinely useful for camping trips or quick presentations in the field.",

The change introduces a new “geofenced variable power” category, allowing higher power and outdoor use under specific conditions. While little will change overnight, the decision could improve future Wi-Fi performance for your phone, smart home gear, and more. Wi-Fi doesn’t usually make headlines unless something breaks, but this week it got a boost that could shape the next wave of connected gadgets. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has voted to expand how unlicensed devices can use the 6 GHz band, a move that could make future Wi-Fi gear faster and more flexible than what we have today. As Fierce Network reports, the FCC’s decision creates a new category of unlicensed devices called geofenced variable power (GVP). This allows certain products to use higher power levels than before, including outdoors, as long as they rely on location-based controls to avoid interfering with existing users of…",

A much larger cover screen is also said to be coming, while the inner screen could grow to 7.5 inches. The camera setup could get its own dedicated space instead of sharing it with the outer display like before. HUAWEI’s follow-up to one of the most unconventional flip phones of recent years seems poised to push its weird-but-wonderful design even further. A new leak suggests the HUAWEI Pura X2 would be a rethink of the form, especially how you interact with it before and after unfolding. When HUAWEI launched the first Pura X in 2025, it stood out by offering a wide 16:10 inner display instead of the usual tall, narrow screen.

That change is the removal of support for .3ds files, which is by far the most common ROM file type for Nintendo 3DS games. The team claimed this was to distance the project from its predecessor’s dubious roots in piracy, but in practice, all you needed to do was change the file extension from .3ds to .cci, and it still worked, provided the files were not encrypted.",

The age of PC emulation on Android is upon us, with new translation layers and software allowing you to play Steam games on your phone or Android gaming handheld without any fuss. Now, for the first time, you’ll also be able to play titles from the Epic Games Store library, thanks to a nightly update from GameNative. And if you’re like me, that amounts to literally hundreds of free games claimed over the years. While support is still experimental, the setup is fairly straightforward. After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration. From there, it will open a browser where you can log in to your Epic Games account. Then, you need to copy an authentication key, paste it into GameNative, and it should automatically populate your game list (give it a minute if you have 500+ games like me).",

Multiple users on Reddit have confirmed that issues with their Galaxy Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic have resolved. The update also brings the January 2026 security update. The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",

The 7-inch gaming handheld remains one of the best on the market more than a year after release. The AYN Odin 2 is now being discontinued, following the Odin 2 Mini. AYN made two major announcements via Discord this morning, and the news is bittersweet for handheld fans. Starting with the good news, the company is running a sale on the Odin 2 Portal, which remains our pick for the best retro gaming handheld you can buy a year after release. The sale starts now, and it will continue through the Chinese New Year, ending on February 25. The company is framing this as “a token of our appreciation to our users,” but it may also simply be clearing stock. While supplies last, the 8+128GB Base model costs $249 (down from $329), the 12+512GB Pro model costs $369 (down from $399), and the 16GB+1TB Max model costs $449 (down from $499).",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Nothing’s co-founder and CEO Carl Pei has confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship this year. Instead, it will focus on its Phone 4a series and audio products. Pei says the decision is backed by the intensifying competition to acquire smartphone components. The Nothing Phone 3 can be classified as less than a success. While it excelled in terms of fun, quirky features , the Phone 3 did not thrive in terms of practicality or value. Despite its novelty, the non-flagship chipset and an $800 price tag easily made the phone feel impractical . And Nothing appears to have taken the verdict to the heart, to the effect that it is taking 2026 to mull over flagships instead of releasing one. In a recent video shared on the official Nothing YouTube channel, co-founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship phone in 2026. This could be a shocker for Nothing fans, as it seemingly was for the staff member speaking with Pei on the talk show. But coming from the outspoken CEO himself, there’s little room for realignment.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Global smartphone chipset shipments are expected to fall 7% in 2026, but industry revenue is still set to grow in double digits. AI-driven data center demand is pushing chipmakers toward high-margin HBM, driving up DRAM prices and squeezing phone makers. Budget phones under $150 are taking the biggest hit as rising costs make low-end devices harder to sustain. The smartphone industry is facing a paradox. Counterpoint Research reports that global smartphone chipset shipments will drop by 7% in 2026. Normally, fewer shipments would mean trouble for the industry , but this time, manufacturers are still expected to see double-digit revenue growth. So, why are shipments dropping? Part of the reason is the growing demand from data centers . As AI becomes more common, chipmakers are shifting their resources to produce high-margin HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for large server farms. This shift has caused DRAM prices to rise sharply, making it harder for manufacturers to create affordable phones without taking a loss.",

The company says the issue affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under rare conditions. Manual and automatic Call Screen still work, and callers can continue using standard carrier voicemail instead. Most recent Pixel features have been welcome additions, but one meant to handle missed calls has instead caused a bit of a privacy snafu. Over the past few months, some users reported that callers could hear background audio during missed calls, rather than being cleanly prompted to leave a message. Google has now confirmed the issue and says it’s disabling Take a Message on the affected devices. In a post on its support forums , Siri Tejaswini, a Google community manager, said the company investigated the reports and confirmed they affect “a very small subset” of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under “very specific and rare circumstances.” Out of caution, Google is disabling Take a Message and its next-generation Call Screen features on those phones.",

As with other E Ink displays, the result is glare-free, backlight-free, and easy on the eyes, making it better suited as wall art than an LCD or OLED screen. Through the SwitchBot app, users can upload and organize artwork, store up to 10 images locally, sync new content, and schedule images to cycle on and off at given times of day.

    "body": "TL;DR A new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 series’s launch pricing may be the same as last year’s S25 series, at least in some markets. This is contrary to earlier reporting that suggested increased RAM prices would lead to higher S26 prices for consumers. The leak in question deals with pricing in Euros, and we can’t be totally sure what it means for US pricing. RAM prices have been soaring in recent months , a trend that’s caused product delays and fueled concern that new consumer electronics of all kinds will see reduced memory, higher sticker prices, or both. It was reported in November that the upcoming Galaxy S26 series was likely to see a RAM-induced price hike versus last year’s S25 phones, but a new leak suggests that might not be the case. Leaker Roland Quandt posted today on Bluesky that pricing for S26 base models will be “pretty much the same” as the S25 at launch, at least in European markets. His post goes on to say that the S26 Ultra may actually be less expensive, coming in about “100 Euro cheaper for 256 and 512GB” models, though he’s expecting the one-terabyte version’s pricing to remain the same.",
