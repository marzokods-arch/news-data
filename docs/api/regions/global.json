To Nvidia, it represents a significant portion of its $5 trillion valuation. To Senator Bernie Sanders, a meteor metaphor. Say that three times fast. In a recent conversation with Axios (via Futurism ), Sanders ponders the potential downsides of such a technology. He tells host Alex Thompson, \"I worry… what the enormous transformational impact in our economy will be through AI and robotics.\" When questioned on whether he thinks OpenAI, the owner of ChatGPT, should be broken up, he says, \"yeah, I do\". He suggests it's deeper than just that, though and that AI in general is \"like a meteor coming to this planet. We gotta be prepared to deal with it in all of its complexity.\" Just this week, OpenAI completed its restructure towards a for-profit entity, which the OpenAI website says \"gives us the ability to keep pushing the frontier of AI, and an updated corporate structure to ensure progress serves everyone.\" It will be controlled by OpenAI's non-profit wing, though this allows it to shift goals as a company and seek extra funding.

Increasingly, market observers think the whole AI thing is a bubble set to catastrophically burst . Or maybe AI is the real deal, and an apocalypse of a very different kind will be upon us soon enough . But one thing is for sure. Whatever the outcome, there's no doubting Nvidia will have been absolutely pivotal. It dominates the AI industry when it comes to both hardware and the software development platforms on which it is all built. But as I watched CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address at the GTC event yesterday , his narrative around Nvidia was just a little too neat, a bit too cute.

I'm pretty sure that's what I'm supposed to say as a certified fan of ye olden dayes , anyway. Sometimes I feel like my job is to make sure these new-old games are digested in the \"correct\" way.

As you'd expect from a battle royale, the types of skirmishes you'll get into in Battlefield Redsec are more varied, so you'll need guns to compete in a variety of different situations. SMGs and shotguns may be lethal up close, but you're going to want something with a bit more damage at range to pick up the slack when you're in a long-distance relationship with your enemy.

Charts on pcpartpicker.com are telling: since mid-2025, DDR4 and DDR5 consumer memory kit prices have been climbing, with particularly notable spikes since September. That's true all the way from DDR4-3200 kits up to DDR5-6000 ones. To take one concrete example, this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 kit on Amazon , which was stable at $95 or less throughout most of the year, but from mid-August onward started climbing. Now, it's up to $184, which makes for a 94% increase. This, after a good few months of sustained DDR5 price drops through the tail end of 2024 and first half of 2025. DDR4 isn't safe, either, as this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4-3600 kit on Amazon shows.

Well, I'd argue it's when you need to strap a bunch of external devices to it in order to get the most out of it, which is exactly what's happened to the Strix Halo-powered OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex . It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

Should an eagle-eyed shopper scoop a downright unreasonably priced bit of kit, it's often a toss up as to whether the supplier will either cancel the order, or quietly honour the few orders that get through before promptly updating the listing and acting like nothing happened. Either way, most companies would avoid making much noise about it. Apparently, London-based Gotraka isn't like most companies. One lucky Redditor spied an absurdly good deal on the black midi version of the Fractal Design North PC case . Gotraka normally sells this case for around £155 (about $205), but the poster snapped it up when it was briefly listed for only £20 (a little under $27). Gotraka not only honoured this incredibly low price, but even sent the buyer a note with their order. This read, \"We made a pricing mistake. You made it go viral. So we did what we believe is right—we owned it.\" Gotraka itself has since shared a blog post going into more depth about how the pricing mistake happened.

In very simple terms, that means the Vera Rubin superchip sports 60 times the number of transistors of an Nvidia RTX 5090 gaming GPU . And that is a completely bananas comparison. What's more, the Vera Rubin superchip is capable of 100 petaflops of raw compute. And that is exactly 100 times more compute than Nvidia claims for its neat little DGX Spark AI box . Oh, and it packs 88 custom Arm cores suporting 176 software threads for conventional CPU compute, too. On a side note, that Arm CPU bit (which alone is known as Vera) is interesting from a PC perspective as you might expect its custom designed CPU cores, which notably support multi-threading, could turn up in a PC processor in the future. Watch this space. At this point you may be wondering how any of this is possible. Six trillion transistors, 100 PF of compute, 88 CPU cores, all in one chip? OK, Vera Rubin is expected…",

I haven't had as long as I'd like with Embark's new extraction shooter, so this review is indeed in progress, with the final version coming sometime in the future when I've had a chance to properly experience it in all of its intersocial beauty. The premise of Arc Raiders is simple: the world has gone to hell thanks to robots and AI, so now all the humans are holed up in small communities underground, with you and other raiders occasionally popping up to the surface to gather resources to trade, create gear, and upgrade your base. On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff.

For those in a rush or who are simply stuck, here are the answers to all three of the questions, as well as what you'll get for a reward. The first dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit Elysium The answer to this is 4 .

There are a number of different pets you can find in the game, either by purchasing them from vendors, or acquiring them through sidequests. Here, I'll run through every pet I've found and how to acquire each one. Remember, if you want to pet or swap your cute and cuddly companion, you can interact with the pet barrel object in the room next to the medical suite, off to the side of the main chamber onboard The Incognito.

Options to purchase the game are gone, the recent reviews are an angry chorus of fans blindsided by Amazon's decision to kill the game, and even the screenshots have vanished. In their place is a single, static image informing onlookers that content updates are done. You can compare the page's glow-down yourself. On the Wayback Machine , a version of the New World Steam page from October 7 features 14 screenshots, three trailers, and 'Mostly Positive' recent reviews, plus options to purchase either the game's standard or deluxe edition. It's now all gone. Which is more than a little odd, since Amazon explicitly said yesterday that the MMO would remain available for purchase \"on all platforms until further notice.\" Canny readers may note that Steam is a platform, and that no notice was given that the game was being removed from it. I've reached out to Amazon to ask about this, and I will update this piece if I hear back. \"New World: Aeternum is no longer releasing content updates. Seaso…",

Though it's sitting pretty at nearly 200,000 views now, that wasn't the case during the stream; while about 20,000 tuned in for the official event as it went live, nearly 100,000 viewers were said to be watching the deepfake feed broadcast (hosted by a channel calling itself Nvidia Live) at the same time (via Tomshardware ). The stream is still up with nearly 100,000 viewers. What is YouTube doing? pic.twitter.com/4uReZrTkFD October 28, 2025 The counterfeit stream has since been removed, but CRN editor Dylan Martin posted to X about the debacle as it happened, observing that at its peak, the official upload had only about a fifth of the viewership of the deepfake feed.

During yesterday's GTC keynote presentation , Huang explained how it was—who'd a thunk it?!—Nvidia GPUs that would unlock the potential of quantum computing. Huang outlined how the individual bits of quantum computing, known as qubits, are inherently unstable, only surviving for a few hundred operations. But \"solving meaningful problems requires trillions of operations,\" Huang said. \"The answer is quantum error correction. Measuring disturbs a qubit which destroys the information inside it. The trick is to add extra qubits—entangled—so that measuring them gives us enough information to calculate where errors occurred without damaging the qubits we care about.\" In this scenario, hundreds of entangled qubits combine to form a single, error-corrected logical qubit inside a QPU or quantum processing unit.

What if I told you there's a way to get around this in the Battlefield 6 battle royale Redsec, if only you show some restraint? It's only explained in a loading screen or in-game tip (if you haven't turned those off) that you can melee downed enemies to perform a shakedown . This will play a short takedown animation that will reveal the positions of any remaining squadmates, whether it's one lone straggler or three of them. It's easy to miss the prompt, so be careful not to do a standard melee swing, as that won't reveal enemies, and you risk outright killing the downed enemy instead.

If you've ever seen a clip of an anime dog girl or a shark girl playing a game, it was probably a hololive vtuber. One of its most popular English-speaking vtubers, Calliope Mori, has over 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube, and several of its Japanese talents have even more. They won't abandon their home on YouTube, but simultaneous streams on both platforms will be more common as each vtuber makes the transition. It probably won't be long until you see hololive vtubers showing up under the most popular game categories, likely giving Twitch a significant boost in viewership.

It was at least the fifth time in the interview that Nadella said the word \"innovation,\" though at no point did an idea of any specificity precede or follow it.

One day is not enough time to confidently declare Blackwell Fields the worst map in Battlefield 6, but that hasn't stopped folks from doing it anyway . I'm enjoying its glorious exploding oil derricks and the way its rolling hills and minimal building cover emphasizes vehicle play, but its major flaw is abundantly clear, because it's the same flaw that's been grinding everybody's gears since Battlefield 6's beta: several of the maps that Battlefield 6 considers \"large\" are actually pretty small. Blackwell Fields isn't big enough. New Sobek City isn't big enough. Siege of Cairo isn't big enough. Iberian Offensive isn't big enough. Empire State isn't big enough. We're beyond coincidence. There's a serious disconnect between what DICE and the rest of Battlefield Studios believe Battlefield maps should look like and what a lot of players obviously want, and I think I've identified an important reason why. Here are the layouts of Blackwell Fields and New Sobek City , two \"large\" Conquest maps that feel cramped. Image 1 of …",

Considering that Vampire Survivors was one of the first games featured in Balatro's first Friends of Jimbo update —a collaboration that both games have followed with more crossovers than I'm willing to count—it's only fitting that Jimbo would return the favor for the update that makes Vampire Survivors more of a communal experience than ever before. Alongside the online co-op mode in which up to four players can roam freely around the map while leveling up together, the Ante Chamber expansion adds Balatro's Jimbo and a trio of rare jokers as playable characters, four similarly Balatro-themed weapons including a burning score counter and a banana barrage, and the titular Ante Chamber stage.

The second punch, delivered near the end of the year, was ZSNES, which did the same for much newer Super Nintendo games. And it was fast —even on the modest PCs of the era. \"When I was 16 years old I started learning assembly, and I got so fascinated with optimization, making everything as fast as possible,\" said zsKnight, the developer behind ZSNES, in an interview last week . While most software is written in higher level programming languages like C++ that are easier to work with, even at a young age zsKnight was skilled enough in low level assembly language to start using it to program his own emulator.
