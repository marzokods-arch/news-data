    "body": "I feel like we're in an era of trying desperately to cut cords and have things look as neat and tidy as possible. Unfortunately, the tech isn't quite there yet to make such things possible—at least not for cheap. We're past the 'tangled heap of cables' stage, but we're not quite at the 'cables? What cables?' stage. And nothing exemplifies this more than the existence of the Razer HyperFlux V2 Wireless Charging System. It's a very suave attempt to keep cables decidedly away from your desk. But it seems the technology isn't mature enough to achieve this truly affordably. Or even for a moderate price. Yes, the HyperFlux V2 looks and feels great, and it does its job, but it's very expensive at $120. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's talk about what that job is. Razer calls this a 'wireless charging system', but in simple terms, it's a charging mouse pad just like the Logitech G PowerPlay 2 . You plonk your compatible wireless mouse on top, and it keeps it charged without you ever having to plug it in. Just like the Logi pad, this is achieved thanks to a puck that slots into the bottom of the mouse, which receives the charge from the electromagnetic field created on the surface of…",

That's because it was often constrained by the limited power budget of mobile form factors. Well, it turns out the laptop RTX 4090 is quite the beast when unshackled from such constraints courtesy of shunt modding, releasing up to 35% more performance and thereby beating typical examples of laptops powered by Nvidia's latest RTX-5090 mobile chip. Our case study here is a Redditor who goes by the handle thatavidreadertrue and an Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 laptop . Apparently, thatavidreadertrue thought the Zephyrus's impressive three-fan setup could go beyond the laptop's official 150 W rating, perhaps with a dash of PTM, or a phase-change thermal pad to replace the factory thermal paste. Oh, and some shunt modding. For the uninitiated, shunt modding involves modifications to the current-sensing shunt resistor in an electrical circuit, lowering its resistance and giving the impression of lower power consumption. As per thatavidreadertrue's Reddit post, \"the laptop was shunt modded by stacking a 1 mOhm resistor on top of the 5 m…",

The \"build your own bundle\" part just means you can choose which items you want, with the overall discount rising the more you buy. Of course, getting all of them nets you the best possible price per book. It's only $11.99 / £10.70 to get the whole lot, which has a total value of $208.84 / £156.40.

Effectively, the data appears to be a broader database, rather than the result of a single new attack, and crucially, doesn't represent \"any one person, tool, or platform.\" This all stems from a new update made to Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), a website where you can check if your data has been breached.

That means starting today, Battlefield 6 is basically two games: the base multiplayer/campaign package that costs $70, and the free-to-play Redsec battle royale included within. What is Battlefield Redsec? It's a 100-player battle royale, primarily, with some Battlefield qualities that EA hopes will set it apart. \"We don't want to just be another battle royale game,\" said Ripple Effect design director Justin Wiebe in a briefing video shared with PC Gamer ahead of Redsec's launch. Destruction appears on par with Battlefield 6 maps in Redsec, vehicles serve as important power weapons, and its big ol' ring of fire will instantly kill squads who fall behind the action. Alongside battle royale is Gauntlet, a 32-player squads mode that sounds a bit more casual and familiar for core Battlefield fans. Here's the full rundown on what we know about Battlefield Redsec.

    "body": "Battlefield has always had an odd relationship with naval warfare—it's featured, just never very prominently—but it was odd to see Battlefield 6 outright ignore boats altogether. Given that none of BF6's maps take place near water, aside from a small section of Manhattan Bridge, it's not really feasible to have them added in at a later date for these maps, either. Hell, even the Season 1 maps don't have enough water for a leisurely cruise. So, no boats, much to the dismay of those of us who loved getting RHIBs beached and miss the days of Carrier Assault in Battlefield 4. Don't falter, though, as Battlefield Redsec, the free-to-play battle royale we all knew was shadowdropping alongside Season 1, actually gives us a glimmer of hope. Redsec's Fort Lyndon is the largest Battlefield map to date (if you can really call it a Battlefield map, that is), and to get around it fast, you need vehicles. This includes your bog-standard jeeps that we've seen in the base game, but also RHIBs that look straight out of Battlefield 4. (Image credit: EA) Found along the sandy banks of Marina, you can hop in these handy little dinghies to quickly travel to other areas of Fort Lyndon. Of course, they'…",

While Redsec is a free-to-play, separate experience from Battlefield 6, it does feature shared cross-progression in many forms, which'll avoid the pitfall of having to grind two games at once. Firstly, how about that download, the bane of way too many recent games? Being free-to-play, Redsec is available as a separate download on all platforms, but if you already own Battlefield 6, then you'll be able to boot it from the main menu. Hopefully this makes having two separate but inextricably linked games slightly less annoying and confusing for everyone, though only time will tell. Moving on to the main course, overall account progression is unified between both Battlefield 6 and Redsec, though there are challenges specific to each one. This means your account level and unlocked gear and customisation options are shared; you level up in one game, you'll see it reflected in the other. Likewise, the battle pass is also shared between them, letting you gain battle pass XP and unlock all t…",

As reported by Automaton Media , the developer recently appeared on a livestream where he discussed human-created music as generative AI becomes a more popular tool. \"From a technical aspect, AI can easily make music. But that's not the point of music, you know,\" he said. \"What actually matters is that there are living humans behind it all. Humans who create things can beat technology just by creating things.\" He continued: \"However, humans probably can't beat business. But we don't really need business. This idea that people need to do business while they're alive is just a result of us all being poisoned by capitalism. Which makes me think—just doing something you consider fun and putting in the effort to refine that skill is ultimately a good thing. That's my opinion at least.\" It's an interesting stance to take in the wake of stories like Krafton announcing it was going all in on becoming an \"AI-first company\" across its library of games like PUBG and Inzoi, along with EA reportedly \" urging its nearly 15,000 employees to use AI for just a…",

I'm writing to give you, the player, options of how to roleplay as the character you rolled up at the beginning.\" It's one place I can categorically say that the sequel is significantly better than its predecessor. The Outer Worlds 2 gives you a lot of incredibly distinct ways to build your character, starting with your background and initial perks, and then through all the optional flaws you'll encounter as you play, along with the perks you can pick when you level up. \"Sometimes that means you have a funny line,\" says Fielder, \"sometimes that means you get access to an area you wouldn't, or ally with somebody that you wouldn't, or you get a mission …",

    "body": "Thanks to the memory demands of AI and key manufacturers reducing production, DDR4 RAM prices have been steadily rising over the past few months. However, this rapid rise has now turned into an overwhelming surge, and in the space of just one week, DDR4 modules have almost doubled in price. We were shocked to see spot prices for DDR4 modules reach $13 when we reported on it last week. So you can imagine my surprise when I saw the spot price for a 2 GB DDR4-3200 module averaged $25 yesterday (via semiconductor analyst Ray Wang , on X). DRAM pricing surge is just completely unstoppable. DDR5 of course is noteworthy while that one company holds DDR4 production hit daily limit. No slowdown for most memory players, module makers, controller......for now at least. pic.twitter.com/nyR8euLXLQ October 27, 2025 To put that into context, you would need to spend $200 to get the eight modules required for a single 16 GB RAM stick, and that's before you include the PCB, heatsink, packaging, etc. Of course, memory vendors that don't make their own DRAM chips (e.g. Team Group and Corsair) won't be paying full prices, as they purchase in bulk and will almost certainly have a deal in place to reduc…",

No, this isn't my pitch for a funguspunk trilogy, this is actual science. Researchers at the Ohio State University recently found that mushrooms you can eat can also be trained to act as bioelectronic data processors (via phys.org ). Specifically, the team grew shiitake and button mushrooms, dehydrated these cultures for long-term use, and trained the fungi to function like organic memristors through methodical electrocution. I know that sounds wild , but that's not even the raddest part.

This thing can get wildly broken, unashamedly so. The kind of broken where at some point the graphics surrender and let themselves be buried beneath overlapping damage numbers. That's what I like about it. Realm of Ink is set inside fictional books, hence the name. Most of the people and creatures you encounter don't know they're fictional entities, which could be why the voice acting is so bizarrely over-the-top, making your average Tales dub seem artful and restrained. I have to confess I quickly zoned out on the story, though the meticulously illustrated worlds kept my interest.

The Omnilert AI gun detection system, which monitors the school's cameras, alerted the school that a gun may be on the grounds, and the authorities were informed as a result. In an attempt to explain what had happened to the students, an officer says, \"I guess just the way you guys were eating chips… Doritos or whatever, it picked it up as a gun.\" After the problem was resolved and the cul…",

So it's lovely to discover that Mechanicus 2 is shaping up to be even bigger and better. Playing the free demo currently available on Steam, I'm really impressed with how the core strategy has evolved. (Image credit: Bulwark Studios) In the first game's Adeptus Mechanicus vs Necron battles (think weirdo religious cyborgs vs ancient alien cyborgs, if you're unfamiliar), the key was a resource called cognition. Harvested from terminals and pillars in the environment, it was used to fuel special abilities and extra movement, but was shared across your whole team, forcing careful decision-making. For the sequel, that system's been ramped right up. Now, cognition is generated by units directly in ways that define their role on the team. Lumbering melee servitors, for example, grant you a point every time they take damage, while your Skitarii rangers instead generate one every time they shoot someone from far enough away.

For instance, original Halo designer Jaime Griesemer was vocally disappointed with the new remake , calling it out for mucking with the level design in a way he reckoned was deleterious for the game as a whole. Well, buckle up, because yet another Halo OG has entered the ring and this one's a lot more positive. Marcus Lehto, art director on Halo 1, 2 and 3 and \" father of Master Chief ,\" took to X to declare that he's a fair bit keener on the remake than his former compatriots. \"It warms my heart to see Halo CE like this,\" says the man himself. \"My honest impression of seeing the new Halo Campaign Evolved is this,\" wrote Lehto, \"I absolutely love where this is going.
