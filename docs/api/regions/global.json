Kravitz's role in the game was presumably meant to be revealed at tonight's Game Awards, but slipped out early in a now-deleted message posted to the official 007 X account— whoops : \"He rose from nothing, broke free, and built his own Kingdom of Aleph.

The whole point of the mode, Blizzard says, is wild, frenetic fun: getting super powerful and collecting every transmog armor appearance, pet, mount, and toy an expansion offers in a short period of time. But the decisions the company makes about the mode, including the most recent update, are often not in support of that goal. Players level up their strength so fast and so far in Remix that they're ridiculously overpowered, tackling even the toughest group content in the game solo, romping through old dungeons and raids as if they were new-player zones. In the current Legion Remix, players are called Timerunners, and the same buff they build up to become OP levelers and fighters also gives them a speed buff—they literally dash everywhere they go. So far, so good. Go fast! But not that fast (Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) But even when the first Mists of Pandaria Remix debuted last year, there were signs of trouble on the horizon.

The upcoming Steam Machine is the most pertinent recent example of this, but, to crank up the enigmatic dial, every bespoke mini PC has its secrets. Case in point, the Zotac Magnus EN mini workstation with RTX 5060 Ti, which seems to power that GPU via the PCIe connector, and not in the same way as Asus BTF cards and motherboards. The mini PC was disassembled and inspected by HKEPC , then brought to my attention by Unikoshardware and Wccftech . Apart from how impressive it is to be able to fit a discrete desktop RTX 5060 Ti into such a small chassis at all, one thing that sticks out is the complete lack of a power cable for the GPU. Looking at GPU-Z shows something interesting: \"Bus interface: PCIe x8 5.0 @ x8 5.0.\" Normally, for an RTX 5060 Ti, it would just show x 5.0. While I'm not sure what the \"@\" is all about, that's basically hinting that the x16 PCIe fingers are split into two batches of x8. And upon closer inspection of the graphics card, it is in fact split in two. As Uniko and Wccf point out, the split-off part gets fed a 19 V input, as they're not being used for…",

The Ayaneo Pocket Play is a smartphone with a sliding display that can be pushed up to reveal a d-pad, AXBY face buttons, and two virtual joystick touchpads. Ayaneo had previously teased this gaming-geared phone early last month . Now, there's a fresh blog post in Ayaneo's typically effusive style about the Pocket Play, plus a Kickstarter page . However, tech specs remain thin on the ground. We don't yet know what processor this bad boy will end up boasting, or even the device's display dimensions. However, given that Ayaneo is known for Android-based gaming handhelds such as the Snapdragon-based Ayaneo Pocket S , perhaps I won't need all three guesses to figure out this phone's headlining hardware specs. So, like most of its ilk, it will likely be an Android device. That means we won't be able to play our precious PC games on it without an emulator, such as Winlator, which is a bit of a job to set up. At least other forms of Android emulation are generally excellent these days. Though there's no gesture at a release window beyond the words 'coming soon,' I'm already intrigued.

Patch 1.6.0 targets four specific issues: Removing the zipline on Stella Montis that lets players go out of bounds. Fixing a collision that let players get through a wall in Blue Gate. Fixing material issues, which meant bullets or arcs' vision weren't blocked by some objects. Patching a gap at the Spaceport Launch Tower, which allowed players to get shot through a wall. I've had a couple of problems here and there with arc's vision or bullets not properly being blocked, although I chalked up my issues to the character movement latency that plagued my games at launch. Although this was fixed a month ago and I haven't had any issues since then. I'm also sad to see another wall exploit kick the bucket after the infamous door glitch was patched out , but I suppose it's for the best. \"We also want to give you a quick update on the patch cadence in the com…",

Now a new sentence has emerged: Magic: The Gathering's new Marvel set has a combo where you make the Incredible Hulk so, so very angry by forcing the poor guy to step on spiky caltrops over and over and over again, hurting his poor feetsies. As spotted by Wargamer , you do need to put in a little work here—the card starts off as an un-crashed out Bruce Banner that has to be transformed with six mana.

If he's attacking, untap him and there is an additional combat phase after this phase.\" Combine this with Caltrops, which deals one damage when a creature attacks, and you start to see the vision: The Hulk crashes into an enemy, roaring, frothing at the mouth.

I think this is probably the best explanation of different storage technologies and their respective latency problems that I've come across. And if, like me, you struggle a little with the (boring, let's face it) nitty gritty, but really get something out of visualisation and simple, big picture explanations, I think you'll agree.

It guides us through the three main storage types of the last few decades—tape, HDDs, and SSDs—and what causes read/write latency in each solution. Part of what makes it such a useful explanation is its use of clear, simple, moving diagrams. Not only that, but many of them are interactive, allowing you to see what happens when you read and write data from different cells. It…",

    "body": "It's been quite a while since the fantasy MMORPG Ashes of Creation smashed through its Kickstarter milestones back in 2017, but the old-school playground brings its player-driven civilization to Steam soon with an early access launch of its alpha build. Emphasis on the early phrasing there. Intrepid's Steam description (and official site) reiterates in quite a few places you're getting an unfinished build of adventures in Verra, but the whole early access thing should make that clear enough. Perhaps it's just hammering home Ashes of Creation is still in its second alpha build and has two beta periods planned before 1.0, whenever that is. You've got less than 24 hours left until Ashes of Creation throws the gates wide open for its early access launch. That's probably not too bad a wait if you're the type with enough patience to play various iterations of an old-school PvX MMORPG where your progression may be wiped. Ashes of Creation release time and date on Steam early access Ashes of Creation launches in early access at 10 am PST on Thursday, December 11.

The yearly Call of Duty game is such a calcified constant of our hobby that, at some point, the people who used to say \"they should stop making CoD every single year\" just sorta gave up and accepted that series is as inevitable as back pain. We pleaded to Activision to take a break, made our case that the 12-month cycle was unsustainable and diminishing, and Activision responded by doing the exact opposite for going on 20 years. With the sort of \"milk it dry\" hubris that defined the Bobby Kotick era of Activision, the megapublisher decided it could outpace CoD burnout— outrun diminishing returns—by tripling down. More studios, more bodies, more CoD. CoD but battle royale. CoD zombies. CoD extraction. CoD on your phone. CoD but battle royale, but on your phone.

Pilestedt casually wrote in response to an X user pitching his idea for an endless mode (as spotted by GamesRadar ), as if he didn't just spill the beans on what would be the biggest shakeup to Helldivers 2 since launch. Well that's exciting. While most of us haven't taken to social media to tell Arrowhead about it, I imagine lots of fans have also wondered what an endless mode in Helldivers 2 would look like.

This matched my own experience with the game back then. The enticing promise of a full and faithful digital recreation of D&D's 3.5 ruleset—and a chance to throw magic missiles somewhere other than the Sword Coast thanks to the game's use of the Greyhawk setting—was brought down by frustrating technical issues and odd design choices. I was never quite sure if I was doing something wrong or because the game had got its d20s in a twist again, so I quickly decided to stop playing rather than spend hours scouring forums in the hope of finding the right workaround.

This week, during a panel at Spain's Salón del Videojuego de Madrid 2025 (via Eurogamer ), John Romero confirmed that Romero Games has avoided closure and is continuing work on an overhauled shooter project. You can watch Romero discussing the status of his studio in the video embedded below. \"We survived the cancellation of our huge game,\" Romero said, earning applause from the audience. According to Romero, his studio had \"110 people working on the game every day for years\" when its publisher—presumed to be Microsoft based on previous reporting , but who Romero Games said it \"cannot disclose\" due to confidentiality agreements—pulled its funding.

And, after playing an albeit too brief demo, it definitely reminded me why I love these creatures so much. There isn't much of an introduction to the demo, let alone the characters. So, if you're not super familiar with the world of Moomins you might feel a little bit out of your depth, as you're immediately introduced to Moomintroll and the gaggle of Fillyjonks' children. However, you don't really need to know the ins and outs of each character, which is one of the reasons these games are so enjoyable. You also get a feel of the characters through the dialogue alone. As Moomintroll is approached by Fillyjonks' children in the snow, they seem incredibly panicked and are quick to ask for your help. According to them, they'd found a lost dog running about in the snow, but before they …",

Word of the layoffs, confirmed by multiple Glowmade employees on LinkedIn , comes just a couple months after the release of King of Meat, a \"co-op party platformer\" for up to four players. It's yet another ugly outcome for a game studio, but what makes this case particularly interesting is that the report claims \"leadership\"—whether that's at Glowmade or Amazon isn't specified—was expecting a concurrent player count for King of Meat of at least 100,000. The actual number? On Steam, it peaked at just 320, according to SteamDB, a number it only managed to achieve thanks to a free weekend. The player count quickly tailed off after that to double-digits, and at this moment sits at just 12, enough to populate three matches.

So it's definitely newsworthy that Asus has just launched what appears to be its first-ever 5K gaming monitor. That's right, 77% more pixels for your GPU to cope with. The display in question is the snappily-titled ROG Strix 5K XG27JCG , and as the name suggests, its key feature is the 5120 x 2880 IPS panel. Coming in at 27 inches in size, though, that's a lot of pixels being packed in there. Specifically, it's 218 pixels per inch, which is an absurdly high density. Pro creators never really care that much about having a display with high refresh rates, but gamers do. Fortunately, despite its immense pixel density, the ROG Strix 5K still manages to top out at 180 Hz, with FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatible VRR support, all with a grey-to-grey response time of 0.3 milliseconds. Sounds fab, right? Well, a resolution of 5120 x 2880 is 77% more pixels than 4K, so you can well imagine how hard it would be for any GPU to run a game at this level.

Speaking of offerings, Razer is only offering 1,337—uh, huh—units of the Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition. So, if you want one, well, you know what to do. Putting the FOMO aside for a moment, the original Boomslang offered 2,000 DPI mechanical ball tracking (actually, the original-original Boomslang was 1,000 DPI and predates 2005, more on which in a moment) that was ground-breaking at the time. The new model ups that to fully 45,000 DPI, then throws in 8,000 Hz polling and optical switches with claimed 100 million click lifespan for good measure. Oh, and where the OG Boomslang was wired, this reboot is inevitably wireless and comes with what Razer describes as a dock with \"next-gen\" charging. Physically, the basic ambidextrous design looks to have been carried over largely untouched. But visible stitching on the buttons betray that it's been, \"enhanced with PU leather-w…",

It's not a new model, as the China-based company actually launched its TF3-360SCB back in July, but I was browsing through some Japanese PC hardware news , which brought it to my attention. With Asetek's 20-year patent on AIO coolers expiring earlier this year, the market has seen a flood of new models, all at vastly reduced prices. That's been good for us PC builders. However, for cooling companies, it's become increasingly harder to make something that stands out from the crowd. Enter stage left, the Jonsbo TF3-360SCB , which (to quote the great Marge Simpson) I think is just neat. You get the obligatory LCD screen in the pump head/CPU mount, but also three extra displays along the edge of the fan block that mounts to the radiator.

Better known as FSR 'Redstone', the work done here essentially brings AMD on par with Nvidia and Intel, in terms of applying AI to upscaling, frame generation, and other rendering technologies. However, it's worth pointing out now that AMD still doesn't have multi-frame generation, so it's not quite at the same level. It's also a little too early to tell whether the new FSR frame generation is as good as DLSS MFG or XeSS-MFG in terms of image quality, and that's because it only works on a relatively small number of games.

Season 2 takes us to the setting of Fallout: New Vegas, and PCG's Ted Litchfield recently had the opportunity to speak to one very interested party: the lead writer of Fallout: New Vegas, John Gonzalez. Gonzalez began by going into some detail on the elements he admired in the show's writing, before things took a rather more interesting turn. \"I really enjoyed the first season of the show,\" says Gonzalez. \"I thought there was some really admirable complexity in the way that they explored the world. I mean, I thought that the Maximus character is a fascinating creation, a fascinating slant to take you into the Brotherhood of Steel. I'm fascinated to see where it goes.\" Gonzalez then makes the dangerous decision to mention the topic of credit and residuals, comparing it to how many early comic book creators were treated: the likes of Bill Finger or Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko. \"It is very odd to see characters that I created showing up in other media,\" says Gonzalez. \"It's also something where there's no credit for that, there's no residuals for that.

Fortunately, after countless trial-and-error crafts and plenty of mistakes, I've finally gotten the hang of it and feel ready to share a little forging wisdom.

According to Embark's official Arc Raiders roadmap , the Cold Snap update brings a new map condition called snowfall, the \"Flickering Flames\" event, a new raider deck (basically a battle pass), and new quests. Players have speculated about what exactly the snowfall map condition will entail (is it just the same maps but with snow?), but a teaser image shared by Embark today of a collapsed raider in the snow suggests the extreme temperatures will carry consequences. It looks like players might have to limit their exposure to the elements to avoid freezing to death, or perhaps toss an incendiary grenade to warm up. That's the most obvious way to make heat a factor of survival, but I wonder if Embark would go even further—what if wearing warmer clothes, like a fur jacket, increased your heat resistance?

    "body": "The Fallout TV show returns for Season 2 next week, with the series opting for a weekly cadence that goes right into February (fine by me: I've still got Stranger Things to finish). Executive producer Jonathan Nolan has already confirmed season three will begin shooting next summer, which just shows you the kind of faith Amazon has in this as a long-term project, and when PCG spoke to some of Bethesda's most senior Fallout team Nolan was a name that popped up frequently. PCG's Ted Litchfield recently spoke to a number of Bethesda worthies, including design director Emil Pagliarulo, and a common theme among all of them was admiration for the quality of the show. In most circumstances you'd put this down to company people saying the right thing about a company product, but the thing is that the Fallout TV show's first season was great . I ended up watching it with my partner, who isn't exactly into sprawling brown RPGs, and by the end she was enraptured by the depth and weirdness of this take on the post-apocalypse. \"It's really fascinating that the show is part of our lore,\" says Pagliarulo. \"It's connected to the games, it's by having the show set, I think it's nine years after Fa…",

    "body": "Battlefield 6 's Winter Offensive update rolled out today, adding a snowy map variant, winter-themed cosmetics, a balancing pass, and unfortunately a handful of day one bugs. According to the Battlefield Comms X account , players are reporting buggy menus, incorrect ticket counts in Conquest (this has since been corrected), and nonfunctional tier skipping in the Winter Offensive unlock path. But worst of all is an annoying stutter that I've encountered on PC. Every minute or two, my client will lock up for a handful of frames, a problem I haven't had once previously in 80+ hours of play. Battlefield Studios has acknowledged this new bug as well, and for now, one possible workaround is to shut down your Steam friends list (assuming that's the platform you're playing on). A workaround that seems to help some players on Steam is to go offline in the friends menu. Try this if you are on Steam while we investigate this issue for a proper fix. https://t.co/gkXDFQjx5p December 9, 2025 \"We are actively investigating an issue that is causing in-game stuttering for some players. We will provide further updates as we work toward resolving this issue,\" the comms account wrote . \"A workaround …",

It looks instead to be a tease for the next game from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. Before Larian became known to the world as the developer of Baldur's Gate 3, you see, it was known to RPG nerds as the developer of the Divinity games. The series goes all the way back to 2002 with Divine Divinity, Larian's second game, and stretches to the 2017 release Divinity: Original Sin 2 , one of the best RPGs to come along in years and recipient of our 2017 Game of the Year award . Which brings us to now. As noticed by MP1st , a new European trademark filing for something called Divinity was made today by a German law firm that's previously filed trademark applications for other Larian games. (Image credit: Larian Studios (via EUIPO)) Where things really take a turn, though, is in the appearance of a separate filing, made at the same time by the same firm, that doesn't carry the name but does look awfully familiar: (Image credit: Larian Studios (via EUIPO)) Cast your memory back to that big statue in the d…",
