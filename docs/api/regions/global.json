    "body": "As reported by the The Wall Street Journal , gaming giant EA is set to go private⁠—that is, no longer be traded on the stock market⁠—in a $50 billion deal with an investor group. This would be the largest such leveraged buyout ever recorded. According to the WSJ's anonymous sources, EA could be sold for as much as $50 billion, though the final price has not yet been agreed on, and EA has an estimated market value of $43 billion. The group of investors reportedly includes the private equity firm Silver Lake and the government of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The deal could be announced as early as next week, and would be the largest leveraged buyout ever recorded. A leveraged buyout is when a private equity firm uses a significant amount of borrowed money to seal the deal, with the asset set to be acquired used as collateral in the debt.

As reported by the Los Angeles Times , one such leveraged buyout eventually resulted in bankrupt…",

It's a scary place that strips you of your gear and forces you to fight your way out with your bare hands and basic movement abilities. Parts of Silksong can be cruel, but Team Cherry at least designed it so you can't be imprisoned unless you've progressed far enough into the game to have the tools you need to escape. Or so we thought. Kilroy found a way to get there without those tools, sentencing poor Hornet to life in bug prison. \"I don't know why anyone would want to do this, but I have done it anyway,\" the YouTube description reads. \"Rest in peace Hornet.\" Sending Ho…",

Today, however, the developer revealed a new feature that—by its own estimation—could screw the entire game up. Presented via Steam news post, the new mechanic is the \"tumble grab.\" When the update drops, you'll be able to latch onto things even after you've flung your condensed little trashcan body. Once the red outlines on the edges of the screen turn yellow, you can grab weapons and items—and even the level geometry. While tumble grabbing, your beam will be able to grapple onto any surface. That means you can, with some finesse, climb up walls and across the ceiling by flinging your tumbling body. Your tumble grabbing ability is tied to your stamina, however, so there's at least going to be one limiting factor preventing complete wall-climbing chaos. \"Tumble Grab also means that you can grab stuff in situations you previously couldn’t,\" Semiwork said. \"For example, if you’re levitated by the vicious Mentalist, you can grab a weapon and fight back!\" Semiwork demonstrated the power of the tumble grab in an accompanying video .

In the video that accompanied the post, game director Jonathan Rogers explained that GGG is pushing pushing those updates now to give them a little more time to breathe before the next content update, which should come sometime around the end of the year. Path of Exile 2's 0.3 update, The Third Edict, came out at the end of August to warm reception . Introducing Act 4 released us from the hell of running Acts 1-3 twice whenever we want to level a character, the Abyss mechanic is fun and rewarding, and in general the community has been happy with the direction of the game. One thorny issue that continues to plague PoE2, however, is the endgame. Currently, in order to juice our maps and for the best rewards, we have to navigate the Atlas of Worlds until we find a spot with multiple overlapping towers. The more towers, the more slots we have for tablets, the more loot we get. This leads to a problem where all the maps we run that don't have multiple towers near them feel like wasting time, something to slog thr…",

Honestly, they could all learn a thing or twenty from Steam. Reading for fun, especially fiction, has been in a boom for the past five or so years. For some people it was a pandemic hobby. Others got indoctrinated by Booktok (the book side of TikTok) and still others were gripped by the rise of the romantasy subgenre. The chemical reaction of that many new nerds in a niche caused an explosion of companion apps. I've tried quite a few of them: the old faithful Goodreads that was basically the only option before all this fuss, stats-focused Storygraph, social media platform Fable, habit trackers Bookly and Bookmory, and others.

    "body": "If you've been following the lead-up to Silent Hill f's release, then you've probably heard some not-so-great things about its combat. I'll concede that the first few enemy encounters can feel bad, rusty-old-knife-getting-sunk-into-your-shoulder bad. But it does get better, especially once you realise that you can just ignore most of the monsters you come across. I'm something of a magpie and a hoarder in survival horror games, which means that I collect every single item I come across and then never want to use them. So my solution to this has always been to rely on being as sneaky as possible and perfecting the art of the dodge. And just like most survival games, it works a charm: I found every single note, letter, item, and omamori in Silent Hill f, and I hardly killed a thing. (Image credit: Konami) One of the benefits of Silent Hill f being a third-person horror game is that you can play corners; I used this to check corners and alleyways before I walked around or past them. Not only did this save me from getting jumped by knife-wielding mannequins, but it also meant I could see when an enemy was approaching and then wait until it went past to make a move to the next location…",

    "body": "It may sound cliché, but Silent Hill f is really the gift that just keeps giving, thanks, in no small part, to all the Silent Hill f endings you can find. I'm not usually one for playing through a game multiple times; I usually get tired of everything well before the first ending in all honesty, but that's just not the case here. Every ending adds so much more to the story; they aren't simply fun easter eggs for players with a bit of extra time on their hands to find. But you don't just have to wait until the end to get new story information. You'll find new items and notes in every subsequent playthrough and even find new cutscenes as you progress through the narrative. This guide will contain minor spoilers for all five Silent Hill f endings . There are four 'proper' endings and one joke ending that carries on the extraterrestrial bit from other Silent Hill games. But while there is certainly a bad ending, there isn't a cut-and-dry good ending this time; it's far more subjective. So the only way to know what ending is the best one in your eyes is to play through them all and see for yourself.

To be honest, and not to take anything away from Bowser, a potted plant could've probably done a decent job as NOA CEO over this period. The all-conquering Switch has continued to dominate the console market and print money, while Nintendo's also expanded into theme parks and most successfully the film industry: 2023's The Super Mario Bros.

In a blog post published yesterday, Blizzard revealed a series of new cosmetics that bring a Starcraft-themed armor set for each Diablo 4 class. And I won't blame you for cocking an eyebrow: It's not the first time Sanctuary's seen crossover cosmetics from another Blizzard IP—D4's gotten multiple rounds of Warcraft skins—but Azeroth's spiky fantasy armor feels like an easier fit for Diablo's gothic palette than Starcraft's scifi soldiers and aliens.

Gameplay looks like it'll be taking an Osu approach with a dual keyboard-and-mouse input system—four central lanes and two side lanes along with flick-style aerial notes that float above the main field. It looks a little similar to Lowiro's mobile gameplay, with a little bit of the arcadeyness from Sound Voltex and Ongeki in there to boot.

With this in mind, the weekly update is an important date to keep track of, whether you're just entering the endgame or perfecting your builds with a shopping list of gear. Below, I'll go over what's available this week and any major changes so you don't miss out. Borderlands 4 weekly update (Image credit: Gearbox) Each week in Borderlands 4, the Big Encore boss, Wildcard Mission, and Black Market vending machine activities change. Since these are endgame activities, you'll have to have completed the campaign before you can access them. These changes go live at the weekly reset time, which is every Thursday at 9 am Pacific. Here's what's active this week from September 25 to October 2: Big Encore boss: Core Observer in the Blacklime Bunker, Fadefields, which has a chance of dropping the Defibrillator repkit, Divided Focus assault rifle, and Bully pistol.

That's exactly what Nvidia's RTX IO was supposed to do, except it doesn't seem to any more, which might explain why it's pretty much disappeared from everyone's radar. The switch in question is a HighPoint Rocket 7638D, as reported by Tom's Hardware . It's of no use to a gaming PC, as it's exclusively for Nvidia's AI GPUs that support a bit of tech called GPUDirect . It basically provides a direct data path between storage, such as an NVMe, and a GPU's VRAM, neatly bypassing the CPU and system memory. It's been around since 2019, a little earlier than RTX IO . That was a much-hyped feature of GeForce RTX 30-series GPUs, and Nvidia expressly said that it allows \"streaming directly from SSD to GPU memory.\" However, if you read the current webpage for RTX IO , that's not mentioned at all, and instead just focuses on its other performance-enh…",

Nebula 's 58 minute, 52 second speedrun (thanks, GamesRadar+ ) shows some already-impressive tech. Firstly, by confirming my 'jumping is faster' instinct (finely honed in MMOs where it was not, in fact, faster) by showing that repeated pogos are the prime method of locomotion for ol' Hornet, here. What really surprises me, as I watch them tearing through Lace like a knife through… well, lace, is their use of the clawline—it seems like you can use it to interrupt your own swings to get more damage out, which is just good advice for anybody. Another thing that's interesting is a complete lack of tools. I'd assumed speedrunners might (and still could) make use out of the game's extensive tool system, but I figure getting the memory lockets and shards to support them—nevermind the tools themselves—might just take too long.

Speaking with TheGameBusiness at Gamescom, Bellamy reiterated that Jagex is still on that straight (pun not intended) and narrow: \"The team have been looking at the way the product currently is, the happiness of players, where they're finding frustration… If we believe this game has another 25 years, what do we need to change? And monetization is near the top of that list.\" These included \"experiments\"—temporary removals or adjustments to certain microtransaction systems to make them, well, less bad: \"Treasure hunter is our microtransaction layer, and we did the total removal of that temporarily. That hasn't been done since it was implemented in 2012.\" Kudos where kudos are due, Bellamy seems open to the idea that his company might make less money for a while: \"We probably won't maintain the revenue that we currently are when we make these changes. That's the truth. But equally, if we're taking a 10 or 15 or 25-year view, …",

If we use Nvidia as an example, it currently relies almost exclusively on companies outside of the US for all the chips and other electronic components that are used to manufacture its graphics cards and AI data servers. Its GPUs and CPUs are made by TSMC in Taiwan, with circuit boards and the host of parts that are fitted to them produced in China.

Sometimes the games I'm torn between are very similar; this is not one of those times. As for the nitty-gritty balance changes: The Ippy Slide (a quite frankly horsecrap option that let dribblers clown on defenders without much counterplay) is dead and buried, and SloClap's \"reduced how quickly players can snap to the ball while using extra effort\" so that volleys are a smidge weaker.

Well, what if I told you there's yet another worth adding to your collection, the Convergence ? The Convergence isn't necessarily hard to get, but it's so far out of the way that you're likely to never stumble upon its dedicated drop source by chance. It's also in the world loot pool, so you can technically get it just about anywhere with some luck. The first time I got the Convergence was actually from clearing a random drill site. Here's where you need to go if you're not feeling lucky, though. How to get the Convergence in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can farm for the Convergence as a dedicated drop from the Bramblesong boss in the Bittervein mine, in the north of the Stoneblood Forest, Terminus Range. This is the northernmost point of the region, behind the Substation Canonary, which is best accessed by heading northwest from the nearby Deathright silo. As with all abandoned Auger mines, such …",

But hey, we did get a look at a brand-new battle system that'll be in the game, which plans to stand alongside Virtua Fighter's traditional style as its own thing. Called Uprising, it seems like RGG Studio's attempt at delving into a more modern fighting game formula with \"dynamic momentum-shifting opportunities,\" according to the presentation. These opportunities come in the form of new mechanics Flowguard, Break and Rush, and the Stunner and Stun Combo systems. The first is a \"new defensive system designed with stylish movements,\" which RGG Studio says \"expands options and introduces fresh dynamics for offense and defense beyond traditional guarding.\" Flowguard's defensive options are closely tied to Break and Rush, which seems to be the main selling point behind Uprising. It's essentially a part break system—repeatedly damaging the same body parts—like the head, body, and legs—will eventually open up huge vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to gain access to \"powerful offensive o…",

Although the technology will initially be limited to the Asus ROG Xbox Ally handhelds and games purchased through the Xbox app, an update to Agility SDK means that other vendors and merchants can now get started on supporting it too. Microsoft's Agility software development kit (SDK) is a collection of tools that game developers can use to implement the latest DirectX features, without having to wait for them to be integrated into Windows itself. In the latest 1.618 version, Agility now supports Advanced Shader Delivery, which was announced last month . The rather unassuming name is for a complex database system that will hopefully be the ultimate solution to all problems relating to shader compilation. Modern 3D graphics involve tens of thousands of different shaders, and APIs such as DirectX, Vulkan, or Metal generate them in a common format. For your graphics card to be able to process them, they need to be compiled specifically for that hardware. For gaming PCs, that process is carried out by the GPU drivers, a…",

Which is why Forza Horizon 6 is headed to the land of the rising sun. In a chat with GamesRadar , the arcade racing sim's art director Don Arceta said that the series' Japanese venture would be \"our biggest map yet.\" But fear not, because it's \"also our most full.\" Just what you'd expect a dev on an upcoming release to say, I suppose, but I've got no reason to doubt Arceta. Playground hasn't run into much trouble creating bigger and more things-crammed worlds over the past couple of Horizon games, and it sounds like the studio didn't run into any trouble finding stuff to do in Japan, either. \"Obviously, we can't go bigger without filling it with things to do and see,\" said Arceta. \"And I think this map that we've created for Japan, or Horizon's version of Japan, is big, but also dense.

During her boss encounter, she'd flit about the stage barking classic lines like \"Shaw!\" and \"Haa!\" and \"Adino!\" and \"Hegale!\" But in Silksong, where she's the protagonist, she's a rather taciturn sort. Which is a crime. But that crime has now been rectified: a modder named Nai has created HK Hornet Voice Restored (via GamesRadar ), happily restoring our heroine's barks. Now, your many attacks will be accompanied by all the hegales and adinos you could dream of. Which is, ah, maybe a bit annoying, actually? This might get me blacklisted for life, but if there's one thing I've taken from HK Hornet Voice Restored, it's that actually Team Cherry might have had a reason for yoinking her voice away when players are in control of her.

I already wrote about this upon its launch, but the Sabre V2 Pro Ultralight Wireless feels like a significant leap forward for mainstream lightweight gaming mice, just like the original Logitech G Pro X Superlight was way back in 2020/2021. That's because it's seriously light and it hasn't been poked full of a million little holes. I remember when I first used the G Pro X Superlight and was impressed by the fact that it weighed only 63 g and was still full-bodied and felt very sturdy. 63 g is old news these days, but flip those digits around and you can impress me once again. That's what the Sabre V2 Pro has done. Some won't get the appeal of an ultralight gaming mouse, and that's fair enough.

Give a small team of brilliant game designers the remit to make chess with toy soldiers, and I think this is what they would come up with. And yet it is not my favorite Advance Wars. My favorite, Advance Wars: Dual Strike for the Nintendo DS, is more the Chess 2 of strategy games. More units, more powers, combining those wildcard bursts in ways that drag matches out into dizzying swingy battles like games of Risk where someone's turning in their bonus cards every freaking turn . Forget perfect: I loved the bombast of Dual Strike being messily over-the-top, and on a visit to indie studio Area 35's Tokyo office ahead of TGS this week I immediately clocked that its new entry in the Tiny Metal series takes after my one true love.

Sometimes I would just stand still and rotate the analog stick so that he'd do that weird whooshing wormy dance that looks so pathetic. It's fun to make Nate do dumb things and laugh at him. And get a load of his stupid walk. What an absolute loser! If you can imagine, it gets much darker than this. Baby Steps is the bleakest game I've ever played. Before being transported to a bizarre mountainous landscape full of illogical obstacles and donkey men with laddish Australian accents, Nate is a 35-year-old man living in his parents' basement.

You will be able to preorder both the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X as of today, with the standard Ally fetching $600 and the Xbox Ally X costing $1,000. The cheaper of the two devices, the white $600 ROG Xbox Ally comes with a Ryzen Z2 A processor, which offers eight RDNA 2 cores and a boost frequency of up to 1800 MHz. This is almost the same as the Steam Deck , which comes in at half the price, and benefits from the lightweight, Linux-based SteamOS. Not a good start for Microsoft. Up next is the black ROG Xbox Ally X, which has the new Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip in it and comes in at $1,000. This chip was recently benchmarked against the Z1 Extreme , which you will find in the still rather great original ROG Ally X. Despite the upgrade to three Zen 5 and five Zen 5c cores (as opposed to eight Zen 4), the Z2 Extreme only sees a performance uplift of 12% in Cyberpunk 2077 with both machines at 25 W.

Entirely contrary to the implications of the \"Z2\" branding, this is a very elderly SoC indeed. The Z2 A rocks four AMD Zen 2-era CPU cores and eight RDNA 2 graphics compute units. Sounds familiar? It sure does, because those are exactly the same details as the Van Gogh APU (Aerith) in OG Steam Deck circa 2022 and also the die-shrunk version of the same chip in the Steam Deck OLED (Sephiroth) . Of course, Valve has just cut the price of the basic 256 GB LCD Deck to a mere $319 . So, that's twice the price for precisely no additional gaming performance, if you go with the ROG Xbox Ally. Great. For the record, in the UK, that's £499 for the ROG Xbox Ally and £279 for the Deck. Doesn't look much better, does it?

I'm not including Mankind Divided's throwaway DLC or the port of dumpy tablet prequel The Fall in this calculation. Sorry to all five Deus Ex: The Fall fans.

    "body": "Splash Damage, the studio known for its work on Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Brink, Gears Tactics, and the cancelled Transformers: Reactivate, has parted ways with Tencent, and is now owned by private equity investors. The studio confirmed the change in a statement provided to GamesIndustry , saying it will continue to operate under its current leadership team but would \"not be providing further comment at this time.\" Splash Damage has been around for nearly a quarter-century, having been founded by a group of mod makers in 2001. It debuted the following year with multiplayer maps for Return to Castle Wolfenstein —which, for the record, were excellent. That focus continued through projects including the Enemy Territory games, Brink , Dirty Bomb , and the multiplayer components of Gears of War 4 and Gears 5 . Chinese holding company Leyou acquired Splash Damage in 2016, and was then acquired itself by Tencent in 2020, which is how Splash Damage got there. But it hasn't had much success in the years since: Gears Tactics , released in 2020, was excellent but quickly forgotten, while Outcasters, also a 2020 release, was exclusive to Google Stadia and didn't survive that platform's sh…",

    "body": "To paraphrase French-Algerian thinker Albert Camus: One must imagine the coin flipper happy. In Unfair Flips, released on Steam today by developer Heather Flowers, you have a coin and a button. The button flips the coin. To win, you have to flip ten heads in a row. Initially, you only have a 20% chance of flipping heads. This is, as the name suggests, unfair. (Image credit: Heather Flowers) It will likely take thousands of flips, and you'll have to manually click for each one. Thankfully, flipping heads rewards you with money. With that money, you can purchase upgrades, increasing the coin's value, your flip speed, your cash combo multiplier, and—crucially—increasing your chance of flipping heads. As the game itself tells you, \"this is the entire game.\" You flip, and then you upgrade your flips, and then you flip until you win. But Unfair Flips isn't really about flipping heads, or incrementally upgrading your odds and income, or stacking combo multipliers for a jolt of post-Balatro dopamine. Unfair Flips is a game about negotiating the temptations of superstition. (Image credit: Heather Flowers) It's a game about the human mind's instinctive drive to find meaning where there is n…",

(For the record, our reviewer liked it quite a bit.) The update has sparked a new round of performance complaints, though, as quite a few players are reporting that instead of being improved, their in-game performance is worse than ever. One of the less-great things about PC gaming is that the nigh-infinite number of potential hardware configurations means that somebody, somewhere, is always going to have problems with a new game launch or update. In this case, though, the problems seem fairly widespread, with reports of diminished frame rates and increased stuttering coming in on Steam , Reddit , and X alike. Some users do say they've seen an improvement in frame rates, or at least that things are more or less the same. But, at least at this point, they seem easily outnumbered by players who say they've encountered the opposite effect. A few players have said clearing the shader cache might help clear up the pro…",

Right now the Konami stans are eating good, and the company seems determined to maintain its momentum. This week's Tokyo Game Show saw another \"Metal Gear—Production Hotline\" livestream, during which Metal Gear Solid: The Master Collection Vol. 2 was announced but not detailed (MGS4 or we riot), and we got a new look at Fox Hunt, a free multiplayer mode being added to Delta on October 30. Fox Hunt is about \"high-stakes, cat-and-mouse encounters\" built around Delta's combat and stealth mechanics. Neatly enough, the name is because you're cast as a candidate member for the legendary FOX unit. Matches can feature up to twelve players and there are two modes: Survival Capture and Survival Intrude.

It was almost like the old days—as close as you can get in a modern software-as-a-service ecosystem, at least—and my favorite thing about Battlefield 6 so far is that EA has doubled down on Portal. In Battlefield 6, your Portal 'server' will no longer disappear after everyone leaves , sticking around in the server browser as if it were a proper rental, and the developers have expanded the map and logic editing tools . In a recent correspondence with the Portal development team, PC Gamer's Morgan Park asked whether we could go so far as to delete all of the buildings in a map to transform it into a flat wasteland.

Saying the Wombo Combo hits like a truck is an understatement, making it one of the best guns for both mobbing and bosses, even without the bonkers splash damage Rafa build . Such power surely comes with a catch, and you're right, it does: it's very easy to blow yourself up with it if you're not careful. Here's what you need to do to get the Wombo Combo.
