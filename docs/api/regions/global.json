    "body": "The Plants vs. Zombies remaster arrived earlier this week, and PC Gamer's resident green thumb warrior Chris Livingston was quite taken by it , predicting that he's likely to sink another hundred hours or so into it on his Steam Deck. The reception is much less warm on Steam , though, where fewer than half of the current user reviews are positive. Complaints about Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted are many and varied. Three leap out as particularly common—the lack of dynamic music (which the original game had), no online multiplayer, and allegations (unsubstantiated, as far as I know) of AI-generated or upscaled art assets—and as usual, words like \"lazy\" and \"cash grab\" abound. More generally (and thoughtfully), though, there's just a broad sense of dissatisfaction with the remaster's attention to detail. The reaction reflects the risk of remastering a much-loved game like Plants vs. Zombies—and, for those who weren't hip to the scene 16 years ago, PvZ is much loved. It was a genuine sensation when it dropped in 2009, and probably the number-one reason EA bought the high-flying PopCap in 2011 for $750 million , after which it did what it does by laying off a bunch of people, turning t…",

It's, I don't know, Vampire: The Masquerade – Sleepless in Seattle or something. All I know is that it's definitely not Bloodlines, and slapping that name on The Chinese Room's game was a mistake. (Image credit: The Chinese Room) More than a mistake, it was a disservice to the game itself. Here's the thing: I very much enjoyed Bloodlines 2. It's a great Vampire: The Masquerade game, dripping with atmosphere, vibrating with conspiracies, and hell, the combat can even be pretty fun when you're absolutely clowning on a gaggle of ghouls with your elder vampire abilities. But I say 'it's a great V:TM game' deliberately. It's a great Vampire game, but not a great Bloodlines game, and that latter name only ever detracts from the game we ended up getting 21 years after an RPG that people are still replaying today.

My 8BitDo Retro R8 isn't as competitively viable as the Logitech I swapped it out for, but it is more convenient. The Retro mechanical keyboard doesn't have rapid trigger, but it does have a few programmable keys and a solid feel. The 8BitDo Pro 3 carries on this tradition, but makes a few more compromises than its desk buddies. The controller I've been testing comes in a purple variant, with red and green face buttons, and is very clearly inspired by the Nintendo GameCube. Looking like tech from a few decades ago is sort of 8BitDo's shtick, and 8BitDo does it better than pretty much anyone else. The Pro 3 looks delightful, both on and off its charging stand, and that charging stand adds more than just an ornament to a room. It comes with a compartment underneath to plug in a 2.4 GHz dongle, which means, if you plug the dock into your PC, it will both charge your controller and work as your connector.

Given each game has 87 bazillion guns (give or take a bazillion), shields and mods to loot, Gearbox likes to sneak in a few dashes of joke sauce to its equipment soup. The bit this time? The shield doms you. You take damage or do anything, and the Cindershelly will let you know that you're subhuman scum. Here are a couple of sample lines, courtesy of our poor put-upon guides writer, Rory Norris, who had some things to say about it last month : \"Touch that barrel and scream for me\" \"Did you let go without asking first?\" \"Don't stop till I allow it\" \"Worship me\" \"Show me how close you can get, worm\" \"What an obedient worm you are\" As Rory explained, the shield was very chatty.

It's an angular set of speakers, with see through panels on the side to blast RGB light into your eyeballs. It feels very 2000s to me, in a way I haven't experienced with any of the speakers I've tested over the last few years. With a depth of connectivity options and that look, it already stood out, but $200 is a decent chunk of cash to spend, and we buy tech for more than just the look. And the answer to 'does it sound good?' ends up far more nuanced than I thought it would after my testing. The G2000 Pro's pretty iconic look is both a big positive and a negative. It's true that among your audiophile friends (assuming you have some), this will be one of the most 'out there' set of speakers. They have a radical angular design, plus a ring in the centre of the see-through plastic that is covered in RGB-lit lines. Powering the G2000 Pro on feels like an event in itself, bathing bright colourful lights into the room. It is truly striking. However, it can also be kind of annoying, as that colour is very bright and pulsing. Holding down the G button on the right-hand side turns o…",

It looks like Nike might be about to change all that, however, as its Project Amplify footwear system is designed to give wearers \"a second set of calf muscles\"—which, in my case, would translate to \"a single, decent set of calf muscles.\" Okay, so they've been designed with \"everyday athletes\" in mind, and I'm definitely not one of those (via The Verge ). But Nike, with the help of its robotics partner, Dephy , has created a system that augments lower leg and ankle movement via a lightweight-yet-powerful electric motor, attached to a drive belt and exoskeleton-like assembly. Which will apparently lead to \"a new future for running, jogging, and walking\", says the sportswear giant. So, it sounds like your next trip to the shops could be enhanced by this augmented pin system, too, not just your next run. Get out of the way, grandma. I need milk, and I need it now .

To this day, I still get a good chuckle out of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Hero's Path feature, which shows you every single step you took on your journey, overlaid on the map. Just a few hours into my playthrough, there's a section where I die over and over again in the exact same location, only to run off for a good 10 hours and return, presumably triumphant, as I continued on my original path. You get to see the failure unfurling in real-time in a bird's-eye view. I won't lie, it's pretty embarrassing, and my partner will never let me live it down, as past me clearly struggled until frustration took hold and wandered off, head hung in defeat. It's a feature that I wish we'd see more of in RPGs, letting us relive our adventures at the end and piece together the mystery of what we spent so much time doing via the map.

This leaves the EU in a very difficult spot: it's so reliant on Chinese exports, yet some would have it spur up its own trade war in response. The European Commission is reportedly drawing up plans of what might be included in measures to counter China's rare earths controls, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg . Though what these might entail is not yet clear—EU leaders are cautious to spark any further action with an important trading partner if it can be avoided. Though there are groups pushing for punitive measures. The European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) is a think-tank suggesting strict countermeasures to Chinese brute-force diplomacy (via Tom's Hardware ).

That also means a lot of my daily well-being, both physical and mental, is influenced by what chair I choose to use. Being tall and slim (184 cm and 70 kg), finding one that suits my needs has been quite the challenge over the years, but in general, I've always picked a quality office chair. I don't have anything against gaming chairs , as there are some really great ones you can buy, but I'm not a big fan of how they look and how bulky some of them are. Given that I sit up straight all the time (raised in an anti-slouching household), massive headrests with 'side wings' like a racing car's seat are wasted on me. So all my work and gaming is done from the comfort of a great office chair , one that I've had so long that I can't remember what brand it is, let alone where I bought it from.

    "body": "The US and Chinese governments have been battling it out once more over trade policies, and the big point of contention this time round is Beijing's latest raft of rare earth export restrictions , requiring foreign companies to obtain an export license for products containing the vital materials. According to a Reuters report , the Trump administration is currently considering multiple different plans in response—one of which being new restrictions on exports to China on items made with, or containing, US-made software. That would track with Trump's recent threat to impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\", announced alongside a new 100% tariff on Chinese goods earlier this month. According to Reuters, the Trump administration's plans are still under discussion, but a US official and three people briefed by US authorities have confirmed that a wide software export restriction is one of many plans currently under consideration. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said that \" everything is on the table \" when asked specifically about the potential software curbs on Wednesday. \"If these export controls—whether it's software, engines, or other things—happen, it will l…",

    "body": "When I started playing Minecraft in 2012 you didn't have any sort of help or guidance when it came to crafting. You had to rely exclusively on your own knowledge, or constantly tab out of the game to look up crafting recipes. It wasn't until the in-game recipe book was introduced in 2018 that I no longer had to rely on the internet to tell me what I needed, but by this point the crafting guide wasn't needed. I had confidently memorised how to craft every single possible item in Minecraft and yes, I flexed that knowledge whenever I could. But it didn't take long for the sheer number of updates and drops to overwhelm my ability to retain all of this incredibly vital information, and I'll admit, the crafting recipe book has been my best friend as of late. But I didn't quite realise how little I now know about crafting in-game until I played Crafting Loop , a browser game that tasks you with crafting as many items as possible in ten seconds, showed me that actually I do not know a single recipe off by heart anymore. In my defense, it's not like you can just go in and start by crafting simple things like wooden planks, followed by sticks, and then torches and tools. You know, the class…",

Martin Luther, Maximilien Robespierre, Karl Marx: these are less individuals than they are avatars of their epochs. Now, another joins their number: Danny Trejo, Hollywood actor and, as of recently, Bethesda reply guy. Bethesda was making all manner of hullabaloo about its Fallout Day celebration in the run-up to the event. That includes, of course, social media posts. One day before the event, Bethesda posted a reminder to its Instagram, urging fans to tune in for announcements and merch drops about Fallout 76 and Fallout 4. Our Danny wasn't distracted. He was in there like a flash on his official Danny Trejo Instagram account: \"Remaster New Vegas boss! 🔥\" our hero demanded , right there in Todd Howard's backyard. At time of writing, it's the most-liked comment on the post, with 50 replies pretty much all saying some variant of 'Hell yeah'. Trejo speaks for a whole bunch of fans.

In well over 60 hours of Battlefield 6, I've had just a handful of excursions in the The Light Ground Transport (or LGT) that didn't leave me riddled with bullets or suddenly exploded. It is so bad at its one job—safely transporting—that it's not unusual to watch your team ignore a fleet of free jeeps and choose to hoof it across the map instead. The LGT is a failure. The Traverser Mark 2 , a new armored transport truck arriving in Battlefield 6 Season 1 , is its redemption. I took the Traverser for a handful of test drives during a preview session on the upcoming maps Eastwood and Blackwell Fields , and much like the maps themselves, I came away unable to imagine Battlefield 6 without it. The Traverser is the LGT's bigger, stronger, and meaner sibling. It seats just four total, so one less than the LGT, but it's also packing three times the fire…",

Without spoiling anything here myself, I'll just say the main issue seemed to be about how abrupt it felt and that certain characters behaved in a way that didn't line up with the rest of the story.

While it's drawing a comparatively smaller crowd of English-speaking players, the anglophone reception has been just as positive. Duckov's got a surprising amount of depth under that parody appearance. Duckov developer Team Soda, a studio owned by China's Bilibili media platform, isn't resting easy on its laurels: Less than 24 hours after announcing its 1 million sales milestone, Team Soda has pushed a new update with a smattering of new features, balance adjustments, and bugfixes. Most of the changes are fairly mundane. Orange headphones can now be dismantled for materials; there's a new UI indicator for when the player's injured; dogs are now more of an early game terror thanks to their footsteps being silenced.

I'm going to go with the New Vegas package first, because I'm a sucker for big boxes and game statues: It does indeed come in a big box, and also carries a big price tag of $155 , plus whatever shipping costs are involved.

Thanks to new reporting from Bloomberg , we now have a clearer idea of the motivation for Microsoft's current gaming strategy—if it can be called that. According to sources familiar with the business, Microsoft executives have been pressuring the Xbox division to achieve profit margins well in excess of industry average. Bloomberg reports that in fall of 2023, Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood introduced a new target of 30% \"accountability margins\"—Microsoft's corporate euphemism of choice for profit margins—for the gaming division. In comparison, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that profit margins in the games industry have fallen from a recent height of 22% during the COVID lockdown years of 2020 and 2021 to an average of 17% in 2024.

Enter the Raiju V3 Pro , another wireless controller pitched towards the Esports scene but instead featuring symmetrical TMR sticks and PlayStation stylings. All for $220, which is $20 more than the latest iteration of the Wolverine. Sorry, what ? The TMR sticks contribute in part to that steep premium. For those unaware, the Hall effect is one magnetic tech that effectively banishes stick drift, and TMR (or tunnelling magnetoresistance) is another. The difference is that the way TMR leverages its electromagnetic sensors allows the controller's sticks to pick up really minute movements, making for a level of precision above even what the Hall effect can offer. Oh, and on the Raiju V3 Pro, you can swap in a long, long thumbstick topper for even more precise movement if that's your jam (though I'm not sure it's mine).
