That is, if the community's to be believed. See, during the Battlefield 6 beta, jumping and sliding was significantly nerfed to ensure the game didn't devolve into a Titanfall-esque parkour fest, where the newest generation (with their intact reflexes and youthful spirit and hair, grumble grumble) wouldn't simply clown on long-time series fans because they know how to b-hop or knife-boost or whatever these dang kids are calling it nowadays. The question remains, however, whether DICE went overboard. As user Jean Martin on X asks principal game designer Florian Le Bihan (thanks, GamesRadar+ ): \"'Zoomers' were liking movements in the beta. In the release 'battledads' like the movement. Can we get an inbetween to please all the community? Also it will be better for the BR part I think.\" I have not heard the term battledads before, and while I'm sure it's an outdated idea to assume everyone playing BF6 are m…",

In fact, I complained about it just yesterday , and how it could impact Season 1. Career ranks aren't too bad, but they currently gate progression for important assignments for new guns and gadgets. Weapon XP, on the other hand, is frustratingly slow, which has only exacerbated tensions around the random bullet deviation epidemic that even the best guns suffer from. Thankfully, Battlefield Studios has answered our calls and is implementing a number of substantial changes \"to go live within the next week\" to quicken the pace of progression: \"Our goals here are to make the progression experience feel smoother and more rewarding while still keeping that sense of achievement when you complete a milestone like fully mastering a weapon.\" Most importantly, the XP required to get any given gun to level 20 is being reduced, so you can start earning vital attachments \"almost twice as fast\". For most weapons, this'll give you access to most of the muzzles, grips, and barrels, though you'll still have to push on for the final few, and for most of the lasers. (Image credit: EA) Whil…",

It’s called Assetto Corsa Rally, which makes sense. Revealed at Sim Racing Expo 2025 in Dortmund, Assetto Corsa Rally will launch into Steam early access on November 13, and has some impressive boasts to its name. For one, it’s the first rally title ever to feature laser-scanned stages. While it’s increasingly common for racing sim developers to visit racing circuit and laser-scan them to capture the minute details of the track surface, the trackside furniture and the precise topography, nobody’s ever attempted such a feat in loose surface racing sims before. In fact, rally games don’t generally even replicate real rally stages on a 1:1 basis, laser-scanned or not. EA WRC, a fine game in its own right, featured sections of stages that were authentic to their real-life counterpart, but they weren’t laser-scanned. That single detail underlines the ambition here, which is simply to be the most accurate and authentic rally sim ever released. The vehicle roster will ex…",

    "body": "Here's a conundrum to start this review: When is a Wi-Fi 7 networking device not really a Wi-Fi 7 networking device? The answer is when it's the TP-Link Deco BE25. It might seem very harsh to start things so negatively, but it's best to get the most important point about this home mesh system out of the way first. Basically, unlike most Wi-Fi 7 routers and mesh networks, the Deco BE25 doesn't support the 6 GHz band or the 320 MHz channel. You just get 2.4 and 5 GHz, plus a maximum 240 MHz channel, making it not better than an average Wi-Fi 6 system. On paper, at least, because the little wireless hubs have a trick or two to make up for it all. If you're unfamiliar with the term 'home mesh system', it's basically a group of synchronised Wi-Fi routers that work together to create a broader and seamless wireless network. Have poor Wi-Fi in your basement or attic bedroom? Then a mesh setup is ideal for you. However, most systems seem to be extremely expensive, and that's certainly true for the high-end models. TP-Link's Deco BE25 is at the other end of the spectrum, with an MSRP of $300, but it typically sells for $209 to $230 . That's for a three-node pack, making each unit as little…",

    "summary": "Never judge a book by its cover, they say. Or a Wi-Fi 7 router.",
    "body": "If you've just bought a new gaming PC or upgraded your current one to an AMD Ryzen 9000-series or Intel Core Ultra 200S setup, there's a good chance you'll be considering an upgrade to your Internet router, too. That's all because such rigs sport ultra-fast Wi-Fi 7 adapters, and if you've got a web connection that's 1 Gbps or faster, you'll surely be wanting to enjoy some mighty quick Steam downloads, if your home is wirelessly networked. What's probably stopping you is the price of a typical Wi-Fi 7 router: Netgear's Nighthawk RS600 is $400, and even its slower RS300 model is $329, while Asus is asking $350 for its RT-BE88U , and that doesn't support the full Wi-Fi 7 feature list. So if I tell you that the TP-Link Archer BE9700 has every Wi-Fi 7 trick in the book, five fast LAN ports, an easy-to-use interface, and costs just $200 , does that make you change your mind? It certainly made me pause for thought and wonder if we have a new contender for the best gaming router you can buy right now. Jumping the gun somewhat, I have to say now that the Archer BE9700 isn't the outright best one around, as it's nowhere near as fast as most of the top-end routers on the market, and it's not…",

    "summary": "All the mesh you'll probably need, at least until wireless devices catch up.",
    "body": "Home mesh systems might sound like a whole new world of wireless technology, but they're really just two or more 'routers' that can transfer data between themselves, allowing for a greater wireless coverage in your house. I say 'routers' because that's just one part of what's inside: you've also got a WAP (wireless access point) and a network switch. But regardless of what you call the TP-Link Deco BE68 BE14000, you're getting a very capable device for providing super-fast Wi-Fi 7 in every nook and cranny of your home. You can buy the system as a two or three-pack, and even just use a single unit (or node, to use the correct term), but we're reviewing the $700 triple node offering here. TP-Link claims up to 8,100 square feet (753 square metres) of coverage with three nodes (6,000 for two and 3,100 for one), which far exceeds the dimensions of a typical home, be it in the UK or the USA. However, if you have a large property with buildings widely separated, that 8,100 square feet of coverage might come in very handy. The Deco BE68 sits roughly in the middle of TP-Link's Wi-Fi 7 home mesh range due to its maximum speed rating of BE14000. That number refers to the peak data transfer s…",

Here we are, howling at the moon for decades-old modes, \"grounded\" character models, classic class setups, and a map from 2011. Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 has impressed me. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year.

I knew from the first time I got my hands on it last year that it had the potential to be the kind of game MMO players have wanted for a long time—including me. And Fellowship just kept improving each time I saw it. The pitch is simple: It's MMO-style dungeons but without the MMO grind. You party up in a group of four—one tank, one healer, two damage-dealers—and work together to clear out packs of enemies and bosses for better and better loot. There's no need to level up a character and churn through hundreds of quests. You pick one of the game's MOBA-like heroes, queue up, and spam dungeons for as long as you'd like. It's one of those ideas that I am surprised nobody really capitalized on for this long. There are plenty of World of Warcraft players who play the game purely for the thrill of grouping up and doing dungeons. Fellowship is trying to fill a niche that surprisingly doesn't really exist elsewhere. And that's what drove Chief Rebel to make Fellowship as its first game. Many of its developers came from much bigger studios and saw an opportunity to help make somethi…",

But before that was a halcyon time when Warhammer 40,000 had a reputation for being about wacky warbands rather than epic armies that cost an arm and a leg to acquire. A time when nobody expected you to have the right models because half the things in the rulebook didn't even have models yet. That said, the first edition of Warhammer 40,000 was supposedly a complete mess rules-wise—borderline unplayable without a degree from Wargame University. How true are these things? To find out I dove into the rulebook and played 40K's first edition.

But while Ubisoft said it was \"deeply grateful\" for his impact on the Assassin's Creed games and \"saddened to see him go,\" it was also apparently the company's idea that he leave. \"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it,\" Côté wrote in an emotional, occasionally gutting message posted on LinkedIn . \"The truth is simple: I did not make that choice. \"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.

That's why we like to take stock after a couple days of demos to see which attracted the most attention—and what that leaves our wishlists looking like. The top 50 most played demos from this season's tastings show that no matter what your preferences are, you'll probably find something promising to try. We've got extraction shooters, racing managers, turn-based and realtime strategy, and a skateboarding demon made out of glass. PC gaming is anything but a monoculture. (Image credit: Half Sword Games) But it does have a lot of people who like physics-based medieval combat. Number one on the list is Half Sword —a notable frontrunner because it's not a new demo, but the same tech playtest that's been playable since May. Far be it from me to judge anyone for wanting to slam two plate-clad men at arms together in the world's clumsiest combat. For a runner up, we have Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era , which calls itself \"the official prequel hailing back to the origins of the genre-defining, critically acclaimed series of tur…",

Paul plays Mecha Man, aka Robert Roberston, in superhero workplace comedy Dispatch , which is out next week from AdHoc Studio. Over a Zoom call last week, I asked Paul why it took him so long to cross over from movies and television into games, and what it was about Dispatch that led him to finally make the leap. \"I've been wanting to get into the gaming world for some time, and I've been spoiled to have been a part of some really great animated projects,\" Paul said. \"There hasn't really been a game that's checked all the boxes, but when this was presented to me, all the scripts were there, already written.\" Dispatch was originally meant to be a TV show , interestingly enough, though that was before Paul was involved.

While Dwarf Fortress history is dense with elaborate defensive superstructures like weaponized magma flows, pits full of war bears, and the trusty dwarven atom smasher , the underlying strategy has been defined by a simple principle: Goblin war hosts can only follow the paths you leave open. As a result, if the only way into your fortress is a meat grinder of boulder traps, sawblades, and entrenched dwarven infantry, goblin besiegers have had no choice but to march headlong into red ruin. Once the siege update lands in a couple weeks, however, invading forces will be leveling the playing field.

With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest videogame developers and publishers in the world,\" the union said. \"EA’s success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place. Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed. Noting that EA had to take on nearly $20 billion in debt to finance the deal—PC Gamer's Lincoln Carpenter has a detailed explainer of the \"leveraged buyout,\" if you want to know why so many people are deeply worried about how this is going to work out—the union expressed particular concern about t…",

The list of permanent updates Blizzard plans to implement in its next season bring foundational reworks to loot and combat that will trickle down into the rest of the game. All of it will be on the PTR next week to test out, but so far it seems like Diablo 4 is about to become a tougher but more satisfying action RPG. Monsters will be meaner and your gear will be more customizable to help you face them. Old systems are returning in new ways and leaderboards are finally back. The change with the most impact—and the most risk of under-delivering—is with combat. Blizzard says monster behavior was “too predictable,” in a draft of a blog post it provided to PC Gamer, and that it’s tweaking things to give each demon a stronger identity. On paper, this sounds like Diablo 4 combat might actually require some target priority, like taking care of a caster in the backline before the tank in the front. I’ve mindlessly torn through enough dungeons in the last few years to be a little skeptical about how much this will shift the feel of combat when your character is fully geared, but it sounds promising.

By some common measures, it's no faster than another small box based on AMD's Strix Halo chip that's available for about half the price. Ouch. Much of this comes down to the minor matter of floating point math precision. I can feel your eyes glazing over, but bear with me. The finer details aren't that important. All you really need to know is that lowering the floating point precision being used can speed up performance at the cost of eventual AI model accuracy. Oh, and that like all Nvidia hardware based on its latest Blackwell technology, the DGX Spark has special optimisations for the lowest and fastest tier of floating point math, known as FP4. In the simplest possible terms, you'll get better results from your AI model with a higher precision like FP8, but it'll run slower. And a lot slower than a GPU with FP4 optimisations. With all that in mind, how does DGX Spark stack up and how does it compared with AMD's Strix Halo chip? Right out of the, er, little gold box, it's worth noting that a DGX Spark w…",

Itagaki was an absolutely transformative figure in contemporary action games thanks to his work at Tecmo, the company he joined in 1992: he led Team Ninja and spearheaded the revival of Ninja Gaiden, as well as creating the Dead or Alive series. He would leave Tecmo under a cloud in 2008, before founding Valhalla Game Studios and releasing Devil's Third on Wii U. Itagaki was known for his sunglasses, pockmarked skin and outspoken interviews, but it was the fact that he and Team Ninja could back up the bluster that made him one of the great creators of the early 2000s. The first 3D Ninja Gaiden, released in 2004, took on Capcom and DMC at its own game and, by my reckoning anyway, beat it handily. That and Ninja Gaiden 2 remain two of the finest hack-and-slash games ever made. The news of Itagaki's death comes from a post to his Facebook page , and PCG has been able to confirm the news via a personal friend of the late developer. That post is titled \"Words to Leave\" and begins, via machine translation: The light of my life is about to run out. The fact that this sentence has been posted means it's finally time. …",

While strategy RPG fans have been eating good for the last few years with the entire genre having a tactical renaissance on PC , Tactics looms above them all, a mythic figure every bit as compelling as Delita, Ramza, and Thunder God Cid, but not everyone can be a legendary armor-busting sword deity. Most of your rank and file allies have everyday Tactics jobs to earn enough to feed their families fresh Chocobo drumsticks. Over my decades of obsession with this king of strategy RPGs I’ve created a highly scientific system to compare and contrast each and every job across four critical axes: Style : Any dummy can swing a sword, but I need more than that, I need fashion sense . How color coordinated is the job, and does their fit have real chutzpah, or did their mom dress them right out of the fantasy Gap? Shenanigans : Tactics is where we all learn that rules are meant to be broken, and some jobs laugh in the face of convention in favor of rock throwing, teleporting, stat buffing, and ability copying.

And early leaked benchmarks of the chip suggest the new M5 is about twice as fast as the original M1 for single-thread performance. So, the question is, why can't PC CPUs make those kinds of gains? The immediate context here is the accuracy of the leaked benchmark and the actual performance gains of PC processors over the same time period. So, first off, the leaked numbers look plausible. That's because the M4 already had very high single-thread performance and the M5 leaked numbers look to have pushed that on 10% to 15% depending on which precise Apple platforms you are comparing. Now you might dismiss 10% to 15% as your usual generational gain similar to PC chips. And it is. Except Apple is iterating on a nearly annual basis, with the M1 launching in November 2020 and the M5 now with us in late 2025. Intel and AMD tend to take two years to release major new architectures. That more rapid Apple cadence adds up pretty fast as the years tick by. How fast?

So, it likely comes as no surprise that I've been pining after the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 headset since it was first announced (ghost type Pokemon are some of my favourites, and it's not just because they often adhere to my carefully curated colour scheme). While I enjoyed my time with the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro , I'm still not a huge fan of the headset's pastel pink 'quartz' colourway. So, when I heard the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is now available outside of Asia , I was there with my Pokeballs at the ready. Obviously, there are a few key differences to note between the V3 Pro and this pretty purple version of the V2. Besides the kitty ears getting swapped out for the ghostie's wee purple horns, the main difference is that the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is a wired headset. That means a stable, constant connection at the risk of forgetting about the wire all together and potentially dragging your rig behind you when you leave your desk…but what sort of Slowpoke would do that, right?

We already knew Tinkerbell and Snow White would be a part of the DLC as they were shown in the original trailer, but Tigger and Cruella de Vil will now be joining us too. Both will play a significant part in the story, with Cruella essentially taking the role of the villain having left the ranch to decay over time. Tigger, however, will be lost somewhere amongst the new biomes of the map and it will be our job to find him.

The results indicate that material created with machine learning tools initially overtook human-written content late last year. However, the data also shows the proportion of AI-generated material plateauing. In fact, the rapid growth of AI content actually begins to slow in the data around mid-2023. Two immediate questions spring from this. First, why is AI content plateauing? Second, how accurate is this study likely to be? Five Percent addresses both of these queries. \"While AI-generated articles grew dramatically after ChatGPT launched, we do not see that trend continuing.

Battlefield 6 's devs have re-affirmed my decision to not get into coding with its latest bug. As spotted by Eurogamer , BF6 players have been suffering a weapon glitch that makes it harder for them to aim—see, in most FPS games, the longer you hold down the trigger, the worse your aim gets. This is called 'spread' or 'bloom', and it's usually accounted for by not shooting for a little bit, giving your poor virtual soldier's tired arms a li'l break. The Gunplay in Battlefield 6 feels rough sometimes because it is still not working correctly. Spread/bloom is not resetting correctly. #Battlefield6 - Example: pic.twitter.com/ymILTAzh6v October 14, 2025 Except, in Battlefield 6, it'll sometimes just not reset at all—as shown in the clip above .

Of course, we haven't seen any characters, but the three images shown on the roadmap give away who we can anticipate arriving. Though, it wouldn't be unusual for Dreamlight Valley to throw in some curveballs either. It currently seems like \"early 2026\" will bring Lady and the Tramp, as suggested by a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs in a Parisian street. Then, it looks like Pocahontas will be joining us in spring, as symbolised by a raccoon sat next to her necklace and a gust of orange leaves. Finally, a statue of Phil in a biome that looks a lot like Mythopia, alongside Hercules' sandals suggests that Hercules may be coming in Summer. This is as much as the roadmap reveals, and whoever is arriving in winter is yet to be announced. I can't imagine we'll see any sort of teaser until we are well into next year.

Stop giggling at the back, I know where you were going. Anyway, the myAir.0 OriMouse came to my attention this morning (via PC Watch ). It's a clever foldable mouse that can be squashed flat to a mere 5 mm thick—but every time I look at the photos and think about holding one, something uncomfortable happens to the back of my neck. I think it's got something to do with the texture of the materials (two different forms of vegan leather, apparently) in combination with the angle of the \"hump\" that would rest in the centre of your palm, which looks to be almost a corner. An inevitable result of the foldable design, I assume, but it gives me a proper case of the heebie-jeebies when I think about placing my hand on one. Which, let's face it, is probably a me thing.

These are facts. Another fact is that, luckily, it's quite easy to upgrade from monitor speakers, which are only getting smaller and therefore worse as displays (and indeed laptops, which suffer from the same audio blight) get thinner to actual PC speakers . This soundbar from Creative, the Sound Blaster GS3 , isn't exactly huge either, and doesn't cost a lot of money. It's an entry-level audio solution for desktop PC gaming, and while it's always going to be better than using the speakers built into your screen—or indeed having no speakers at all—let me be clear, you shouldn't expect miracles.

But as this clip from Charlie Intel demonstrates on X, standing on a stationary recon drone and clonking it with a sledgehammer causes an almost-definitely-unintended physics interaction that launches the drone and its surfer directly upwards.
