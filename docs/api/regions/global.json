We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I think we can all agree on this statement: Dogs . Dogs are great, and it's a scientifically proven fact that any game can be improved by a factor of 90% by simply adding a dog to it—and that rises to 99% when you can pet that dog. But how well do you know our loyal, four-legged friends? If you saw 10 different dogs from 10 different games, do you think you could tell me their names, or at least the games you know them from? In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a dog, and all you have to do is type in its name. To make things a bit easier, you can guess either the name of the dog or the name of the game . So, if you can't quite remember a dog's name, you can still make a guess about what game they're from. Sink your teeth into this quiz, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

Instead, Rockstar has maintained the termination of the employees it fired last week in a manner the union described as \"unacceptable and unlawful.\" \"Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants. Our members allege that Rockstar’s conduct constitutes trade union victimisation and blacklisting.\" The dismissals in question occurred on October 31, when more than 30 Rockstar employees in the UK and Canada were fired without warning . The IWGB alleged at the time that the employees were fired because of their efforts to organize a union at Rockstar, calling it \"the most brazen act of union busting the games industry has ever seen.\" Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive denied the claim and said the employees were fired …",

Worse, the Steam Deck took more than two years. But never fear: No such antipodean delay is in the cards for Valve's new line-up. Here's confirmation straight from Valve: \"All three products will ship in all the same regions we currently ship Steam Deck (US, CA, UK, EU, AU ) as well as regions covered by Komodo: Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\" None have a specific release date nor price at the moment anywhere in the world, but are targeting early 2026. \"Specific launch timing and pricing to be shared sometime after the first of the year,\" Valve writes.

This time, a trademark for the name 'Steam Frame' gave away the Deckard project's real name ahead of our visit, but Deckard rumours have been rife for years. Some more accurate than others, but generally not miles off when you piece it all together. But is this some sort of clever scheme by Valve to drum up support or test out the popularity of ideas on dedicated fans? No, apparently not. That's right from the horse's mouth, too, and if you take this as further proof of some sort of grand plan, I have a bridge to sell you. Stood in a room surrounded by Valve engineers that drew the short straw in having to talk to press, I raised the question, how do they feel when someone gets near-definitive proof of something like the Steam Frame early?

The Steam Frame offers a few ways to play games, both locally on its own Arm chip and streamed from a nearby gaming PC.

So it only has to do a lot of work in that area. We are doing something similar to that dedicated to the streaming process.\" Foveated streaming requires the Steam Frame's new eye tracking feature. This uses two cameras embedded just above the wearer's eyes, through which Valve can very quickly monitor where a user is looking at any one time.

However, it's also a sign that times are changing, as systems running on Arm are receiving much greater support from Valve. Valve has been largely focused on x86 processors over the years. These chips from AMD and Intel are the dominant player in PC gaming, so it only makes sense as to why. But in recent months, Arm support is seeping into Steam in a variety of ways. SteamOS will receive Arm support with the launch of the Steam Frame sometime next year. I don't suspect you'll be able to take that ISO file and load it onto any old Arm-based device right away, like a modern mobile phone, and have it just work. It's still not possible to stick SteamOS on any gaming PC and have it just work, but it is improving in that regard. The chip powering the Steam Frame isn't unique to the headset, however. It's the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (SM8650), which is found within various flagship phones, such as the Asus ROG Phone 8 . \"This is already fully o…",

Valve sees the Steam Frame as both an accessory and a gaming PC. It's right to do so.

Speaking to IGN , design director Justin Wiebe assured players that the studio is \"always listening\". \"As soon as the game launched, we had people kind of looking at all forms of player communication, and taking notes and saying, ‘OK, well, we had planned to do this in live service, but we're hearing that this is a problem for the community',\" Wiebe explained. \"If it's a problem for the community, then let's talk about it. Let's see how we can prioritize that.\" Wiebe also discussed BF Studios' approach to responding to issues brought…",

The idea behind the Steam Controller is that it allows you to interact with your PC while on your sofa or away from a desk with the accuracy of a mouse, without actually requiring one. This is, and always has been, a good idea. Where people differ is on whether the original manifestation of the Steam Controller, first released in 2015, was any good or not. I never used it for long enough to get to grips with it—which was, in large part, the problem with it. Some here at PC Gamer own the controller, but rarely, if ever, used it. Others here actively despise it. I imagine that represents a pretty good cross section of the wider PC gaming community.

This is a complex story, but to précis the salient details, the use of extreme ultraviolet light to shrink down chip components to smaller proportions than ever before throws up some rather peculiar problems, leading to flaws when transferring the patterns contained in the lithography masks to the silicon wafers. In simple terms, it comes down to the way the EUV light diffracts and distorts as it passes through the various lenses, reflectors and apertures of the mind-boggling complex ASML lithography machines used by TSMC to manufacture the most advanced chips. Using conventional chip production techniques, these can't all be controlled and corr…",

There's plenty of toga cosplay to go around as you slip into the sandals of a Roman governor at the peak of the empire, managing the needs of your people against the demands of the emperor. There's more of a narrative going on in Anno 117 than your average city builder as well, which is a nice touch. Our Anno 117: Pax Romana review says, \"At times it borders on so friendly and non-threatening to your endeavours that you feel like you could leave it unattended for an hour and return to find everything absolutely fine. At others, the sequence of events required to tick off the next chapter objective feels so long and incremental that you wonder if you’ll achieve anything at all of note this evening with it.\" When is the Anno 117 unlock time?

But I'd be lying if there wasn't part of me that still desires that dopamine fix of scrolling through a site for easily ingestible content from familiar faces or display names. That's been ingrained into my brain ever since the heyday of online forums. So I'm more than a little interested in cyberspace.online , a social media site that is \"how the internet was supposed to be\" (via Hackaday ). The most immediately striking thing about it is its aesthetic, which is pulled straight from my childhood dreams of what hacking would probably be like: green terminals and lots of '@' usernames. You can theme it with any colours and border sizing you like, but it comes with some pre-mades, including C64 , VT320 , and green Matrix options. Personally, while I don't know if I could stand it long-term, I like the VT320 one because it reminds me of Hacker: Evolution . Once the novelty of the theming has worn off, as it surely will, you might wonder what there is to actually do in cyberspace.online. The first thing to note on this front is actually what it doesn't do. The dev, going by 'The Anti…",

We got to peep a new trailer showing off Bowser Jr (voiced by Benny Safdie) and the undisputed best princess in the Mario universe Rosalina (Brie Larson) alongside the return of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and a miniature Bowser—who was shrunk at the end of the first movie, if you forgot. Bowser seems to have taken to a bit of a Rapunzel lifestyle, chilling inside a toy-sized castle and painting diabolical works of art where he's a jacked-up hot bro. For whatever reason Bowser Jr.'s debut gets hit with the Prowler sound effect from Into the Spiderverse, and it looks like he'll be replacing his papa as the sequel's antagonist. The trailer finds just enough time to squeeze in an appearance from my beloved Rosalina at the end making quick work of a Megaleg before making way for the movie's release date: April 3, 2026.

Where Winds Meet is not quite an MMO, but it has a lot of the associated hallmarks—guilds, dungeons, raids, PvP, and a huge audience waiting to get in. As the game’s official X account announced Monday, that audience has brought the game to a soaring high of 10 million pre-registrations before the game’s launch on, Nov. 13.

The trouble is, 3D V-Cache-equipped AM5 chips are usually quite pricey. Those looking for a properly sub-$300 beastie with AMD's game-crunching cache tech (the 7600X3D has an MSRP of $299, and usually retails for a lot higher than that) have traditionally had to make do with chips built for the previous-gen AM4 socket, like the Ryzen 5 5700X3D .

There's something alluring about a game running on a CRT monitor , so they took it upon themselves to bring gaming on a small CRT display into the modern age, all in a somewhat-portable format. The donor screen came from a portable Sony TV of what looks like early 90s stock, which at the time would have been a cutting edge device. However, while the internals of the TV are relatively compact for the era, fitting them into a console-friendly frame and interfacing them with modern hardware turned out to be quite the task. After reaching out to a number of exper…",

    "body": "Bungie's next game, the troubled reboot of Marathon , is most easily described as an extraction shooter—currently the hottest genre on the planet due to the enormous success of Arc Raiders . But if one former Bungie developer had got his way, Marathon wouldn't be an extraction shooter. Not because he would have made the game differently, but because he hated the term so much, he wanted to change it. Speaking on the Shooter Monthly podcast (via TheGamePost ), Bungie's former director of product management Chris Sides said that he thought about collaborating with the studio's marketing team to come up with a different term for extraction shooters, one that presumably would have been pushed in the runup to Marathon's launch. The reason for this, Sides says, is the vagueness of the term. \"The problem is Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it's not. The genre name is so bad. I hate the genre name of extraction shooter. When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like: \"Can we please create a different genre name, because extraction shooter is so dumb. It's the only genre where its name is a mechanic.\" Sides then elaborated on why he broug…",

So, if there was a way to get this process streamlined for me, I'd probably jump at the chance. This is why the creation of Steve, a mod that implements AI \"agents\" powered by systems like OpenAI and Gemini into the game, could be the best friend of players in need of an extra pair of hands. Created by YuvDwi and shared on GitHub, the Steve mod is pretty straightforward to understand. Essentially, it adds LLM-powered AI agents directly into Minecraft, which respond to your commands and play alongside you. This means you'll have a gaggle of Steves to boss around and ask to do tasks you simply cannot be bothered to do, or the ones you need some extra help with, like culling a bunch of sheep or mining for a specific resource. As stated in the mod's description, the agents \"aren't following predefined scripts\" either. Instead, they're \"operating off natural language instructions\", which allows you to basically talk to them as if you were playing with friends, minus the inevitable argument when someone is …",

Last night's State of Play trailer for inKnobini: One store. Many stories renewed the excitement I felt after playing inKonbini's short demo over the summer. Set in '90s rural Japan, it captures the unique energy Japanese convenience stores have—there's a sense of care and reverence to truly provide a service to the community. I wouldn't want to do a Tesco simulator , but this, I like. As someone who works in customer service, it's not something you'd think I'd want to replicate in my downtime—that being said, I took a busmans holiday in Two Point Museum this year and thoroughly enjoyed it—but Two Point has a knack for turning the mundane into goofy Aardman-style skits.
