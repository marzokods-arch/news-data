Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . Like anthropomorphic rabbits and Jesus, software developers love an Easter egg. Microsoft is no different. For most of its history, the Windows developer has inserted hidden jokes and references into many, if not most of its programs. These range from a Utah teapot that appears in Windows 95's Pipes screensaver, to a secret magic 8-ball toy inside Microsoft Access. But the most famous, or should I say, infamous Microsoft Easter egg is The Hall of Tortured Souls, a Doom-style 3D maze hidden inside Excel 95 that displays the credits of the designers who worked on it. Not only is it one of the more elaborate Easter eggs concealed in a Microsoft product, but this innocuous secret would also become the epicentre of a bizarre Internet rumour that Bill Gates was the Antichrist. Hiding designer credits is something of a traditi…",

    "body": "If you were hoping to get in on that Steam Deck hype without splurging on the newer model with the OLED screen, well, it's whatever you'd call the opposite of a Christmas miracle: They're sold out, and Valve isn't going to make any more. As Liam Dawe wrote for GamingOnLinux , a disclaimer was snuck onto the Steam store page which outlines the various Steam Deck models: \"We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256 GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.\" The disclaimer still there , and at least in the US, that original model is sold out for good. It may not have the delectable, vivid colors of the OLED version, but it was a hell of a workhorse for the price. PC Gamer's Jeremy Laird called it a \" stellar deal \" when the price dropped a few months back and I'm inclined to agree with him; PC gaming has a reputation for its high financial barrier to entry, so to have a handheld option with bespoke UI and docking functionality for under $400 was a pretty wild value proposition (even with consoles on the table). That said, there's a new handheld PC or gaming-centric Android what feels like every day now and Valve has hardware ambitions beyond the Deck, so it makes…",

Whether you agreed with our picks or not, I hope you were entertained to read about why we loved them so much. Of course, 2025 was also the year I developed a terrible compulsion to turn everything that happens around here into trivia questions. So, inevitably, it's time for the first ever official PC Gamer GOTY quiz! There's a question in there for each of the 14 games we gave an award to this year. Some are pretty easy, some are pretty hard, and hopefully some will make you curious to go play something you didn't get around to in 2025. Let us know how you scored in the comments below—and then feel free to have an argument about which game you think should have won GOTY.",

Now, developer Nuggets Entertainment has released the first major update to RV There Yet? sim since launch, which adds a whole new map for players to drive their knockoff Winnebago across. The map is set on and around the fictional slopes of Mt Yurbuttsk, a frigid jumble of ice and rock that your chain-smoking holidaymakers must pass through on their quest to find Route 65. Nuggets gets straight to the point when listing the update's features, with a recent Steam post revealing the map includes new animals, items, tools and \"snowball fights\", as well as a new narrative to thread the whole thing together.

    "body": "Personal Pick (Image credit: Future) In addition to our main Game of the Year Awards 2025 , each member of the PC Gamer team is shining a spotlight on a game they loved this year. We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . Okay, I do play some new games— Arc Raiders has my attention right now, for instance—but not too often. I'm someone who tends to return to the same handful of evergreen multiplayer games, the World of Warcrafts, the Hearthstones, the Counter-Strikes, the Overwatches. But occasionally there's a new game that catches my cautious eye: The Finals , Escape from Tarkov , and Stormgate , to name a few. This year, that game was Killing Floor 3 . Actually, it was on my radar prior to this year, because Killing Floor is a series of games very close to my heart. The original wasn't the first game I played on PC—that award goes to either Call of Duty 4 or Team Fortress 2—but it was close. Killing Floor came out in 2009, when I was 14 years old, and I got hooked on it. I wanted a friend to play it with, though, so I convinced my console gamer friend to buy a gaming PC by giving him my old Nvidia GeForce 9600 GT when …",

I'm aware PC gaming moves so fast nowadays that many games get washed away without anybody noticing. But I thought Painkiller would have sufficient cultural cachet to stick around a little bit . Perhaps it's because Anshar's studios reboot made some major changes to Painkiller's formula, reworking People Can Fly's devoutly singleplayer horde shooter as a Left 4 Dead -style cooperative blaster infused with Doom Eternal -ish movement. The combination was ambivalently received by those who did notice Painkiller's release, with the game receiving a Mixed rating from just under 600 Steam reviews. The reboot did not go down well with Painkiller's creator, Adrian Chmielarz. Speaking to PCGamesN , Chmielarz says he played Anshar's reboot in beta. To say he wasn't impressed is putting it mildly. \"I disagreed with every single thing they've done in it,\" he told the site. Oof. Chmielarz is familiar with Anshar Studios, stating they are \"Great guys. They do a lot of outsourcing work, and every now and then they attempt to make their own game again, and I appreci…",

But its latest update— Stories Untold —expands the Zone itself, adding new areas and new quests to give veteran Stalkers something extra to do over the holiday season. The update revolves around a new mystery in the Zone, namely a strange transmission giving stalkers \"headaches, nosebleeds and even hallucinations\". The storyline becomes available after players leave the Zalissya region during the early game, in the form of a PDA message that can arrive anywhere on the map but is particularly likely to turn up around the Burnt Forest region. GSC says this new story adds \"over five hours of gameplay\" with eight new missions to embark on and seven additional locations to explore. GSC doesn't specify what these new locations are, but mentions that they are \"free to explore for everyone in the Zone\", so expect to encounter the usual dynamic events the Stalker series is known for.

We all know the last few years have also seen a rise in great co-op horror games like Lethal Company, REPO, Content Warning, and Sons of the Forest—gamers seem to enjoy nothing more these days than getting scared together. So, like… where are all the Stephen King games at? Huh? People love Stephen King. People love scary games. There's certainly no shortage of material to work with, to the tune of 60+ books, 200+ novellas and short stories. Can we get going on this already? I was actually surprised to learn that despite King having been cranking out horror fiction since 1974, there have been only a tiny handful of games officially based on his works. There was a text adventure for The Mist in 1985, a side-scrolling beat 'em for The Running Man in 1989, and another adventure based on The Dark Half in '92. The…",

The new map and bosses are a big middle finger to people who got comfortable with the old meta. Many Nightreign players, including myself, got used to running similar setups for boosting damage output as much as possible without having to waste too much time in a run. The shrinking, battle royale-style circle doesn't give you a lot of time to dawdle, so the meta revolved around a specific relic that gives you attack power for defeating summonable bosses around the map via evergaols—which is far easier than searching for bosses and hoping to find good random rewards. Here's the thing: The new map in the DLC features zero evergaols. The relic that lots of players have relied on to easily route through the map is unusable if you want to do the new stuff. You have to actually explore again and figure out an efficient route every time you drop in, which is made even tougher by how labyrinthine the layout is. The reason I think this was an intentional move is because FromSo…",

The overhaul of League's \"visual aesthetic,\" as Bloomberg put it, will impact characters, battle arenas, and the interface, and is aimed at making the game more welcoming for new players. League of Legends has a reputation for being rough on newcomers, which is probably inevitable for a game that's been around for 16 years. To put that in perspective, you could've started playing before the Covid-19 pandemic hit and still be 10 years behind the real veterans. That's a big hump to overcome, but Riot needs to surmount it: LoL is still one of the biggest and most successful videogames on the planet (the 2025 Worlds had a base prize pool of $5 million) but the existing player base is getting older and there aren't a lot of newbies jumping in . The continued success of League is vital to Riot, because it's struggled on other fronts: In early 2024 it laid off 530 employees and closed Riot Forge, the initiative it launched in 2019 to make singleplayer League of Legends games in partnership with external studios.

Epic took action against Strock in February , claiming he \"takes control of other players' Epic Games accounts through fraud,\" including by trying to fake out the Epic support team. Strock sold hundreds of stolen accounts through a channel on Telegram, Epic alleged, earning himself \"thousands of dollars in profits\" in the process. All of that is a violation of Epic's EULA, of course, and after months of the legal process doing what it does, the now familiar outcome occurred: Strock ate it. \"I would like to apologize to the Fortnite community for wrongfully obtaining access to and selling Epic Games accounts that belonged to others,\" Strock wrote on X . \"This is against Epic’s rules.

There's a bit of moss growing along a nearby stone wall, but it's not solid, so you can pass through it. Run toward the wall until you drop through the moss and into the Secret Cave.

The Game Post spotted the first indications that Cross had left Bungie, reporting that Cross's LinkedIn profile now listed a 2025 end date for his position as Bungie senior art director. Cross's X account biography had also been updated, removing a previous mention of the studio. Cross has since confirmed to Kotaku that he is no longer employed by Bungie, and that it was his decision to leave the studio. I'm incredibly proud of the visual world we built for Marathon.

As per these regulations, TSMC can only transfer production tech that is at least two generations old to its fabs outside of Taiwan.

More importantly, though, it seems that it won't be the US chip giant that will be making them, but Samsung instead. That's according to a news report by The Korean Economic Daily , aka Hankyung (via Tom's Hardware ). Sources within the industry have told the publication that Samsung is \"on the verge of securing an order for Intel's 8 nm chips.\" It's not talking about the company's CPUs or GPUs, though, but rather its PCHs or platform controller hubs. Better known as a motherboard chipset, these little dies are responsible for handling the control signals and data flows between the CPU and all the peripheral slots and ports (PCIe sockets, M.2 slots, USB, etc). Intel doesn't provide a huge amount of information about how and where these chips are made, but in general, they're not manufactured via cutting-edge process nodes. Rather than using Intel 7 or …",

It's an attempt to replace your TV and your Hi-Fi system with something altogether compact and stylish, that won't falter when the sun comes shining in. While there are plenty of TV replacement projectors out there vying for that spot in your home entertainment system, few have the chops to nail gaming too. That's where the Dangbei DBOX02 Pro comes in. Smooth and shiny on the front, this mostly matt black cube features subtly rounded edges and a lightly curved facade. It's a modern aesthetic that proudly flaunts a touch of those lovable retro vibes, without being smothered in buttons and dust-catching greebles. The projector itself sits atop a seamless stand that grips it on either side. It allows for a 360 degrees rotation and 120 degree tilt for ceiling projection. There's none of that twisting the little feet to get the perfect angle, either, since the DBOX02 Pro comes with an impeccable InstanPro AI auto key…",

With a total estimated shipment of 2.62 million in the third quarter of 2025, this means that OLED monitor shipments have grown by 84% year-on-year.

It's called In the Jungle, and it's not just adding more Dave the Diver to the Dave the Diver—it's doing something completely new. The DLC is set in a new location, a village in a jungle beside a freshwater lake. The fact that it's freshwater is interesting: you don't make sushi from that kind of fish, so you've got a new type of restaurant to run. Welcome to Bancho Grill! (Image credit: Mintrocket) What's even more interesting is the break from the standard Dave the Diver formula. Yes, you still dive, catch fish, and battle bosses, but the village is a place you can freely walk around, as if Dave is visiting Stardew Valley. Instead of the days being broken up into morning, afternoon, and night segments, as in the base game, the island takes place in real-time, giving you the freedom to manage your schedule as you fish, socialize, and work at the grill. You can even explore with Dave's friends, like Cobra, following you around. Plus, it's presented in a new isometric …",

Normally the preserve of big tech events like CES and Computex, AMD has decided to buck that trend and quietly launch a new Radeon RX 9060 XT graphics card. Its unique selling point? A marginally lower power limit. There was no announcement behind the launch whatsoever, as AMD just dropped the new card into its product pages , alongside its other Radeon models (via BenchLife ). Simply labelled as the Radeon RX 9060 XT LP, it's literally just a normal 16 GB RX 9060 XT that's had its 160 W power limit reduced to 140 W. The product page doesn't mention any changes to clock speeds, but these have been lowered, too, as this can be inferred from AMD's listed theoretical performance figures. For example, where the standard RX 9060 XT has an FP32 vector rate of 25.6 TFLOPS, the LP version is stated as being 25 TFOPS. Going through all the metrics, the RX 9060 XT LP has clock speeds that are between 2 and 3% lower than the standard XT's, so instead of a boost clock of up to 3130 MHz, you're looking at 3050 MHz.

    "body": "If you have an Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, or ASRock motherboard, you need to update the BIOS if you want to continue playing Valorant. That's because a critical flaw was recently found that allows cheaters to bypass hardware-based security checks and potentially inject code before Riot's Vanguard anti-cheat can wake up. As laid out in the Riot Games blog (via Tom's Hardware ), Valorant relies on IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) to check the ID of your memory and only allow greenlit devices to get access. In the BIOS/firmware, your motherboard has Pre-Boot DMA Protection, which uses IOMMU to prevent a rogue device from accessing your system as it boots up. This means, once you're into the operating system, your device assumes all is good and continues as normal. The blog post says, \"In some cases, hardware manufacturer firmwares incorrectly signaled to the operating system that this feature was fully active, when it was actually failing to initialize the IOMMU correctly during early boot.\" This means someone getting in before those security functions boot up can effectively bypass the security, and \"by the time the system is fully loaded, it can’t be 100% confident that 0 inte…",

At the same time, it also revealed that the new operating system would be home to another major software release: DirectX 12 . It's been a decade since both were officially released, but while Windows 10 has been shuffled off into the realms of 'end of life' support, DirectX 12 has grown to become the most comprehensive collection of graphics APIs ever created. To celebrate this fact, Microsoft has published a short blog detailing some of the major improvements and upgrades that DirectX 12 has enjoyed over the years. For some folks, especially those who have been involved with PCs for as long as I have, it will only seem like yesterday when the new API was let loose. However, ten years is a long time in PC gaming. For example, back in 2015, Intel's four-core i7 6700K was the best gaming CPU you could buy. Since then, however, not only has Intel released nine further generations of chips, with the most recent sporting up to 24 cores, but the processor of choice for discerning gamers has switched to being an AMD one.

Thus it reached me through the grapevine (some people call it Polygon ) that Brennan Lee Mulligan was changing D&D forever, shaking things up, the madman, the maverick! He was doing so by, as the video below from the official Critical Role channel details, allowing players to level up at a time of their choosing—doing the pesky things like rolling for HP in advance, but otherwise letting them hold off until a satisfying moment occurred. \"We're going to prepare for a level up, that, actually—we don't know exactly when it will occur.

In a new effort to set the record straight, Vincke said today that Larian will hold an AMA in the new year, giving gamers an opportunity to learn more about how developers at Larian actually get things done. Larian's AI controversy erupted earlier this week in the wake of a Bloomberg interview in which Vincke touched on some of the ways developers at the studio are making use of generative AI tools. He made clear that the studio isn't using generative AI for any in-game content, like art, writing, or voices, but that did little good: The backlash against what was perceived as Larian's pro-AI stance was immediate and fierce. Vincke tried to smooth things out with a subsequent post on X in which he was more specific about how exactly Larian developers use generative AI, but that did not satisfy many of the studio's fans.

Della Bitta spent 10 years across two stints at Blizzard, as well as two years as general manager of Riot Games in North America. More recently, he was a co-founder of Dreamhaven , the developer and publisher headed up by former Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime. But it's the departure of Ohlen that strikes me as the most notable development here, at least from a gamer's perspective. A 22-year BioWare veteran with lead design and director credits on everything from the original Baldur's Gate to Anthem, Ohlen took the wheel of a then-unnamed new development studio at Wizards of the Coast in 2019; Exodus, the studio's first project, was revealed at The Game Awards in 2023 .

Nobody has decided on an official name for it because it utilizes a bunch of different skills, but it's technically an \"auradin\" build like the ones you'd see during the days of Diablo 2. However, I propose that we start calling it the aura farmer build because the engine running everything is a holy aura that burns nearby monsters when you have a unique pair of gloves on. What's better than a single holy aura? 11 holy auras, obviously. In addition to surrounding your character, you can summon a pack of wolves and an ally mercenary who will inherit the aura too. Now, you have a whole team of aura farmers that leave a trail of ash in their wake.

The November tournament , which you can watch embedded above, saw a roster of eight seniors—the oldest being 95 years old—battling online in what were likely the most seasoned matches of the King of Iron Fist Tournament that the world has ever seen. It's …",

    "body": "In 2021 PCG reported on a singular scientific experiment: rats named Carmack and Romero had been taught how to 'play' Doom . I use the inverted commas because, cute and cool as it was, the question of whether the rats were really playing Doom in any meaningful way, or just running on a ball for some delicious sugar water, was not conclusively answered. The project leader Viktor Tóth said at the time he wasn't happy with how they'd implemented the shooting response, and four years later the team is back with a new setup that significantly expands what the rats can do ( first spotted by Tom's Hardware ). And this time, the rodents are rocking a trigger mechanism. The first version had the rats suspended in a harness over a ball that rotated when they moved, with that movement mapped to a simplified version of a Doom corridor with an imp at the end. When the rat did the right things, it would get a reward in the form of sweetened water. The limitations meant that it was a bit of a stretch to say the rats were playing Doom, but as Tóth said you could make a decent argument they were \"kinda\" playing Doom. The new setup still maps the rat's real-world movement into a Doom environment, b…",

Maybe that's the best compromise: Blueprints have felt pretty stingy in Arc Raiders since launch. I've played for nearly 50 hours and haven't managed to find more than seven—to be fair, I'm not looking all that hard, but it's strange that other rare loot (like fancy guns and gadgets) are significantly easier to find than the blueprint for items that aren't even that good, like muzzle brakes. That was probably the aim of raising drop rates in the first place, though Embark never actually confirmed it raised them in the first place until today's hotfix. My only regret is that I didn't jump back in while the loot was overgenerous. Oh well, at least I'm more likely to find the number one blueprint on my wishli…",
