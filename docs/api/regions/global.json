(If you just want to know what it is, you can spoil it for yourself by reading the fourth slide in this article about PC gaming's greatest twists .) Jennifer Hale, the voice actor playing Jedi Master Bastila Shan in Knights of the Old Republic, did not know the twist in advance. As is often the case in videogame recording, she didn't get to see the script until she was in the booth. \"We never got our scripts ahead of time\", Hale recently told Buzzfeed . \"Most of the games I've ever done have been cold reading. I walk in, and I see the line. I do the line, and it goes to market.\" And so she got to be as shocked as most players were when she got to the end. \"I did not see the twist coming!\" she said. \"Knights of the Old Republic really sh…",

But I hold a special place in my heart for the time Bill Gates went on stage at the height of his power to show off Windows 98, fresh from the world-changing but notoriously buggy Windows 95—and watched it crash mid-demo. The moment, captured above, was from Gates' keynote at the then-major COMDEX trade show a few months before Windows 98's launch. Microsoft's Chris Capossela was in the middle of demonstrating a novel feature—plug-and-play USB support—by hooking up a scanner, prompting Windows 98 to download its drivers. Then, wham: Blue Screen of Death. Gates takes it in stride, quipping \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet,\" but I always figured somebody got chewed out for the crash afterward.

For instance, in the reviews for Lawn Mower Simulator, you will find the owner of a lawn maintenance company asking, \"Why are we cutting grass at 2.5 inches??? Are we $20 lawn guys?\" The idea that you can put the word \"simulator\" after any job or mundane activity and make a videogame out of it used to be a joke at the expense of series like Farming Simulator, but it's no joke anymore. A cottage industry has grown around simulating every job and activity it's possible to simulate: hairdressing, gold mining, home renovating, power washing, you name it. And inevitably, the people who actually do these jobs show up in the Steam user reviews to tell us how well the game matches reality, which is how I learned recently that firefighters do not, in fact, use the \"fireman's carry\" where you sling someone over your shoulders. The reason was pretty obvious once I considered it: heat and smoke rise, so raising someone off the ground is going to increase the amount of heat and smoke they're subjected to.

    "body": "When I come back to work after a nice long vacation, I open my email client with the sort of dread usually reserved for month-old leftovers at the back of the fridge. Not so for Battlefield 6 lead producer David Sirland, who recently returned from some PTO and immediately asked the entire Battlefield community an irresistible question : \"What irks you with BF6 right now?\" The X post attracted over half a million views and 2,000 replies in just over 12 hours. Sirland didn't respond to everybody, of course, but he did comment on a lot of the issues gnawing at players—maps, recoil, dispersion, and that laser targeting bug that's ruining the lives of heli pilots, to name a few. He also noted what fixes we can expect from the next big BF6 patch, which will arrive in the \"near future.\" Below is a recap of Sirland's impromptu AMA, broken down by topic. Bots A lot of folks complained about bots in Battlefield 6, to the extent that Sirland wrote a secondary thread outlining exactly how bots are used in the game. None of this is stuff we didn't already know—bots are used to seed servers as they're spinning up and are supposed to be replaced by real players—but he acknowledged that this proc…",

The whole thing first came to our attention by way of this Reddit thread, in which someone claimed that their friend had been banned from the Battlefield 6 community on Steam for posting a message explaining how to disable crossplay in the PC version of the game. Anything on the internet that begins with \"my friend said\" triggers immediate suspicion, but the image of the ban message looks legit, and more to the point the listed fix does apparently work. My friend make a post on steam about disabling crossplay on PC and here is a result from r/Battlefield6 This is notable, because while the console versions of Battlefield 6 lets players toggle crossplay on or off, the PC version—so I'm told, I can't run it myself so I can't check—cannot. Which seems very odd to me, although I suppose it makes sense if EA expected PC sales to lag significantly behind consoles: Maybe the worry is that if PC players limit themselves to their own pool, the relative…",

    "body": "Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted rolled out in October, and I thought it was pretty good: Really just a higher-resolution (and more expensive) version of the original PvZ phenomenon, sure, but fine overall, and of particular benefit for people who want to play the game on a Steam Deck . Serious fans were unhappy, though, for a number of reasons, foremost among them the music. Music in the original Plants vs. Zombies is dynamic, you see, changing with the events on the screen, but for some reason EA did away with that in the remaster—instead, it only played the \"high intensity\" version of the soundtrack. It sounds like a minor thing (even at its most intense, PvZ music is pretty not intense ) but holy cow, did people notice—including composer Laura Shigihara—and they did not care for it . Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted landed with a sub-50% \"mixed\" rating on Steam, quite a contrast to the \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating the old GOTY Edition holds. I created the music in Plants vs. Zombies with the specific intention of it being dynamic. Instruments gradually appear to match the intensity of zombies & prevent audio fatigue.Replanted Level 1-1: ALL THE DRUMS RIGHT AWAYYears later + bigg…",

And, I suppose, some of you might also have your fingers crossed for Fallout: New Vegas 2. You probably shouldn't hold your breath waiting for it to happen, though. In an interview with The Game Business , Obsidian vice president of operations Marcus Morgan and vice president of development Justin Britch said they know lots of people want followups to the studio's greatest hits, but the developers who work there are more interested in doing other things. The hangup is that after years of making games based on other people's properties—KOTOR 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, Dungeon Siege 3, South Park: The Stick of Truth—Obsidian is apparently having a pretty good time doing its own thing. \"I know everyone on the internet, on every game we ever announce, will constantly reference back to, when’s the next New Vegas?

Since sometimes there's not universal agreement on how a game's name is punctuated across different sites (such as Steam and Wikipedia), I've gone to the publisher's website (when possible) for the definitive answer.

It features the titular anime girl, Lulua, standing by a horse-drawn cart, with another character peering out of the cart as it's being pulled down a country road. It's an image of idyllic fantasy, seemingly matching the Atelier brief (which I'm led to understand is a generally lighthearted affair about slice-of-life alchemy). But if you seek the game out on Steam , the Nintendo shop …",

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers.

Specifically, that's the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, the only version of AMD's Strix Halo mobile APU that's available with all 40 RDNA 3.5-spec graphics compute units available. And it's those 40 CUs, plus Strix Halo's exceptionally wide (for an APU) 256-bit bus, that make it so appealing, on paper, for gaming. But it also makes it expensive, as the new OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex amply proves. For the record, you can get the OneXFly Apex with Ryzen AI Max 385 starting at $1,399. But that has a downsized GPU with 32 CUs, significantly lessening the appeal of the device. Anyway, the \"base\" model with the top-tier 395 APU kicks off with a hefty 48 GB of memory. If that sounds like overkill, especially for a handheld, remember it's shared between the CPU and GPU. You also get a 1 TB SSD. The OneXFly Apex can be optioned up to 128 GB of memory and a 2 TB SSD.

With the name Project Suncatcher , you'd be forgiven for thinking that Google is hoping to design a special solar panel system to power all of its data centers. Well, that's partially correct, but Project Suncatcher aims to use the power of the Sun by getting just a teeny bit closer to it, by putting the data centers in space. This isn't some whimsical fantasy; Google has seriously thought about all of this, as detailed in its research paper (PDF warning) on the project.

Yet because of the way the Internet works, what players see in a demo playback may not reflect the game they experienced with complete accuracy. As of Counter-Strike 2's latest update, however, players should find playbacks better representative of live matches. This is thanks to a new feature Valve introduced to the demo system named TrueView. \"With TrueView, demo playback will match the player's original experience much more closely,\" Valve writes in a Steam post . \"Previously demo playback showed the server's view of the world, without accounting for network latency. This could be confusing because shots would hit that didn't look like they should have, and vice versa.\" (Image credit: Valve) As Valve explains, TrueView attempts to solve this issue by re-running the client-side prediction.

    "body": "Revenge of the Savage Planet was generally well-received when it released back in May this year, accruing a Very Positive Steam rating and a respectable score of 81% in our Revenge of the Savage Planet Review . But according to its creative director Alex Hutchinson, the comedic cooperative adventure hasn't made all that much money, despite over a million people playing it across PC, console, and services like Game Pass. In fact, one might argue that the last sentence should read 'because' rather than 'despite'. Hutchinson certainly reckons that Game Pass is part of the problem. Speaking to FRVR , Hutchinson explained that although Microsoft's service exposed Revenge of the Savage Planet to hordes of new players, this didn't convert into cold, hard cash for developer Raccoon Logic. \"We’ve had millions of players and that’s great, but people have an expectation of getting things for free these days—whether that’s through Game Pass or other things—it hasn’t monetised as well as we would like, which is pretty dangerous,\" he told the site. Hutchinson then elaborated that Revenge was \"not a super cheap game\" to make, and that because it was funded largely by Tencent, it is \"not a game w…",

I was looking at some of GTA 4 again recently, and it's really dark, and I was like, 'Ah, that's why.' I was single and miserable, and I wasn't sure I wanted to stay in America.\" All good reasons to end up writing a dark yet brilliant script for GTA 4. \"My life felt in a lot of flux,\" Houser continues. \"As a company, we had all that Hot Coffee drama, so we constantly thought we may be shut down in the middle of making [GTA 4].\" If you're not aware, the Hot Coffee drama that Houser is referring to spawned from a mini-game in GTA: San Andreas. Found by a team of hackers, it let players have sex with CJ's girlfriend after prompting \"movement\" commands. This may not seem like a huge deal now, but it was quite the controversy at the time, as the game was pulled from shelves…",

That's per an interview Houser had with Lex Fridman , which you can also find below. Houser says that, circa '98, \"my life was a mess. I was in South America, in Colombia, when there was a war waging there. I was making a series of very poor life choices, and the lack of life skills aged 25—my latest poor choice was to get up too early.\" Colombia during the '90s was, to risk an understatement, not exactly the best place to be , which is something Houser discovered first-hand: \"The police didn't start work 'till nine but the muggers started at eight. I was out walking along the beach at eight.\" He recalls speaking with someone on the beach before \"two guys came to talk to him, and I couldn't tell if they were trying to mug him, if he owed the money, or if he'd bought me to them. \"One of them had a machete and one of t…",

Thanks to both the film and reality, Burry made his name foreseeing the sub-prime housing market collapse and World Financial Crisis it precipitated in 2008. Fair to say he has form when it comes to predicting financial catastrophe. According to Fortune , it seems Burry sees just such a calamity befalling Nvidia. His hedge fund, known as Scion Asset Management, has reportedly bought $1 billion in put options on Nvidia and another AI-adjacent company, Palantir. In really simple terms, put options give the holder the right to sell a company's stock at a fixed price in the future rather than the prevailing market price.

Dying not just to our shared lack of time, but also to an era of player that has aged out of its prior old school tendencies, like the elves sadly getting on a boat for the west. And while part of that's true, the recent spate of MMO news has me wondering if it's entirely our fault no new MMOs are coming out. Corporate wisdom (which is oftentimes an oxymoron) would have you believe that live services are the new moneymaker ( sure, if you hit it big , if you don't, you die) and that MMOs are unsustainable. To be fair to that wisdom, there are nuggets of truth in it. I don't mean to say that MMOs are a sure bet, far from it. MMOs are expensive, require constant maintenance, and competition is fierce because we don't like trying new stuff. But also, Amazon kinda messed New World up, and its shutdown is more about mismanagement than anything else. Contrary to hindsight, New World is not, on paper, a failed MMO. It did so well on launch that it had Amazon salivating over game development for a minute. Even when things quietened down, it still wobbled around 10,0…",

It seems the variant we always wanted to see, which majors in graphics rather than CPU grunt, is set to be released. Chinese PC specialist SixUnited has a couple of new Ryzen AI Max models listed on its website (via Videocardz ), and indeed, a SixUnited tablet running one of the \"new\" APUs has popped up in the PassMark database . The most exciting model is the Ryzen AI Max+ 388. That combines eight CPU cores with the maximum 40 graphics compute unit count available from Strix Halo. Currently, the only way to get a version of Strix Halo with all 40 RDNA 3.5c CUs is to go with the very top Ryzen AI Max+ 395 model. That's a very expensive APU and comes with fully 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, which is arguably overkill for mobile gaming, especially within the confines of a handheld. In practice, Strix Halo has therefore thus far been of more interest as a tool for running local AI models on a limited budget than for gaming. But what if there was a cheaper model that kept the 40 graphics CUs and 256-bit memory bus, but cut the CPU d…",

It's China's latest bid to break away from US-made tech, and follows news back in August that data centre operators were being instructed to source at least 50% of their chips from domestic manufacturers . Now, data centres that are less than 30% complete are being instructed to remove already installed chips if they're foreign-made. One facility in a northwestern province that planned to deploy Nvidia chips has allegedly already been suspended before even breaking ground as a result of the latest guidance. However, it's being decided on a case-by-case basis whether data centre projects at a more advanced stage can keep their foreign-made chips.

One semiconductor research team claims to have achieved just that by stacking not chips or dies, but individual transistors. The work by the team at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia was published in Nature Electronics (via El País ), and as is always the case for such academic research, it's all very complicated. Basically, though, it comes down to the idea that chip makers are looking to go up , rather than using smaller transistors or wider dies, to keep Moore's 'law' alive. Processors such as AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilise hybrid bonding techniques to stack dies on top of each other, to increase the number of transistors in the whole package, so there's more cache.

But the bugs piling higher than a locust swarm in a grain silo threatened to undermine the game's foundations. The first batch of bugfixes landed with immediate effect, addressing issues like deformed pets and vanishing ghost children. Slightly later than planned, the second QoL patch has now arrived, fixing more than 150 problems raised by the community on the EA forums and social media. As with any systems-heavy game, The Sims 4's complex web of interactions often produces patch notes that read more like a comedy script than an actual changelog, and this latest update includes some classics of the genre.

Now, Bethesda would like you to know it's gearing up to break your mods once more, but at least it's a limited subset of them this time. With Fallout 4's 10th-anniversary edition gearing up for launch in the next week, the studio's warned players that it's going to break any main menu mods they might have come November 10, presumably because Todd Howard just gets a sick thrill from it. Or, well, possibly also because FO4's anniversary version will entail changes to the game's main menu, and so mods based on futzing about with the original version of that main menu will encounter stuff they don't anticipate in the new version and spark out like a robot fed a logic problem.

    "body": "AMD has just posted its latest financial results and the message is clear: Things are good. Things are very good. Indeed, CEO Lisa Su summed it all up succinctly: \"We delivered an outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability.\" Overall revenue was up 36% to $9.2 billion, while profits grew by 31% to $2.2 billion. Remember, these numbers are for the third quarter of 2025, alone. But from a PC Gaming perspective, the really good news is that the figures weren't all about selling AI chips to the likes of OpenAI. Sure, AMD's data centre revenue was up 22% year-over-year to a record $4.3 billion, making it the largest single contributor. But combined client and gaming revenue increased even more, up 73% year-over-year to $4 billion. In other words, AMD is still pulling in almost as much cash from PC processors and graphics chips as it does from servers and AI clients. \"Our PC processor business is performing exceptionally well with record quarterly sales as the strong demand environment and breadth of our leadership Ryzen portfolio accelerates growth,\" Su says. Even gaming graphics, often the laggard when AMD reports its financials, are looking up. \"In gaming, revenue incre…",

You might be shocked as I was ( appalled as I was, mortified as I was) to discover that People Magazine, a publication for normal, well-adjusted readers, made no mention of the fact that Jonathan Bailey has voiced a catboy in a videogame since 2017. It mostly focuses on what he likes to do on a day off, what he'd tell his 15-year-old self, and how a perfect date night for the man would go. Where's my G'raha lore, People? For shame. Anyway—it's really nice to see Bailey continue to meet with success. He was getting work beforehand, mind, but his international stardom's grown exponentially since 2020. Which I have to admit is probably due to him starring in Bridgerton and not because he voiced my favourite scion. He also starred in 2024's Wicked movie, which is based on a musical you might've heard of. I'm confident his new appellation won't go to his head, though. One of the things I like about Bailey, aside from his performance, is that he doesn't regard his work as G'raha with any less importance than his sta…",

As announced in a post on the official Minecraft blog , the Dragon Ball Z DLC features a \"hard-hitting adventure that will test your mettle, allow you to strike down villains, and see if you can go over mine-thousand.\" So rather than just adding a set of skins and some new NPCs to the survival mode of Minecraft, it will add an entire arena for you to fight against the series' most popular characters and change the entire survival crafting experience we're used to into a fast-paced fighting game. Each of the roster's 11 characters come with unique abilities to use in battle as well, which will unlock as you defeat each one. However, it's not all about fighting.

The forty-year-old tech may not store much, but it does have a loud sound. Wait, that's not a good thing? In a video titled \" SD Cards are LAME! \", Plummer shows off his DEC RA82 disc drive. \"You can feel it through the floor when it seeks hard\" is what Plummer tells the camera, in what I can only assume is a bit of glee. In order to even get the drive up into their home rack, Plummer ordered a hydraulic scissor lift. \"You don't so much install one of these as you do birth it like an ocean liner\". To get the drive operational with his choice of OS (Unix), Plummer did a low-level format to handle future data, partitioned the disk into different regions for storage, and then created file systems on those partitions. And what does all this weight, size, and effort get you? A whopping 622 MB of storage. That's …",

This meant that someone was able to archive the source code for the site's entire frontend and stick it on GitHub (via Ruri on X ). Now, I can't imagine it won't be long before this all disappears, but like AMD's accidental leak of the source code for FSR 4 , once it's out on the Internet, it'll be there for good.

A fightpad module was included too, so you could swap out either the left or right modules for some tactile six-button action. I'm describing this older model in such detail because this newer Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded (now labelled 'by Turtle Beach') is functionally identical to that older PC controller . There are some minor changes once you scratch the surface, but before I get to those, let's re-iterate what carries forward. Like its predecessor, the Victrix Pro Reloaded has the nowadays essential \"pro\" features, including four programmable paddle buttons, trigger stops on the L2 / R2 switches, and Hall effect analog sticks. Three d-pad variations are included, which accommodate both Xbox and Switch Pro variations, as well as a hybrid of both, and these can be popped in and ou…",

Of course, there are also guns and other, more combat-focused items to loot, too. It's a lot to juggle, admittedly, but Arc Raiders has two features more extraction games need: detailed item cards and an optional auto-unloading backpack. Each item, no matter how flashy or mundane, will have a description that tells you not only what it is and what it's used for, but also roughly where to find it. There are a few outliers with inaccurate or misleading descriptions, but for the most part, you know exactly what each item can do for you.

YouTube maker channel Not From Concentrate apparently shares this sentiment, having shrunk the standard, bulky console into a comparatively svelte 6-litre chassis (via Videocardz ). While the base version of the PlayStation 5 is a comparatively chunkier 10.4 litres, the slim—with the detachable disc drive that looks kinda like a zit to me—is only about 7 and a half litres. So, yes, you do lose those eye-catchingly swoopey white wings but you do gain back a whole lot of space around your TV.

A big question that has come up as the game transforms yet again, is how often this is going to happen, and if it will continue for the foreseeable future. Speaking in an interview with Diablo streamer Raxxanterax , associate game director Zaven Haroutunian touched on this concern. \"The intention is not to replace everything just because we can,\" he said. Instead, the team tries to get a \"holistic picture of the whole game,\" and look at \"what is not pulling its weight, what is not helping support the player experience in a positive way.\" Haroutunian says monster types were one of the things that went untouched since the game launched and that they needed to be redone before a dungeon with leaderboards could be added. The Tower dungeon coming in the next season relies on the new monster types to gauge your completion progress, encouraging you to seek out tougher enemies for more points—something that just wouldn't work wit…",

Blueprints are one of the rarest drops in Arc Raiders , as they unlock the ability to craft weapons permanently instead of waiting for them to show up in the shop. The Anvil is a great blueprint to secure early on thanks to the gun's high damage and its Arc armor-penetrating heavy ammo. It's like carrying a pocket Ferro that you don't have to reload after every shot. Because blueprint spawns are somewhat random, there's no surefire place to get an Anvil blueprint. There are, however, raider containers that have a high chance of containing weapon blueprints. Thanks to the investigative work of the community, these caches can be tracked down with consistency. Where I found the Anvil blueprint I found the Anvil blueprint in a convenient hidey hole on Dam Battlegrounds that seems to always spawn raider containers. The raider cache spawns in a gap under where the raised highway on Dam Battlegrounds ends. The spot is between Raider Outpost East and East Broken Bridge.
