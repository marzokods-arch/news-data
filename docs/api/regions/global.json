Big updates for Stardew Valley are typically years apart, and though it feels like we just got the last major patch yesterday, version 1.6 launched in March 2024.

But with GDC now just a month away, there's bad news for the conference and everyone hoping to hear what he had to say, because he's not going to be there. Word of the last-minute withdrawal came from the Kojima Productions X account: (Image credit: Kojima Productions (Twitter)) \"We regret to inform you that Hideo Kojima will no longer be able to attend this year's GDC Festival of Gaming,\" the message says. \"We understand that this will be disappointing for fans and attendees who were looking forward to hearing him speak, and we want to offer our deepest apologies.

I bring this up because Botany Manor sounds very much like my kind of puzzle game—lots going on, but not too intellectually taxing—and it's free right now on the Epic Games Store . Botany Manor is a cozy first-person puzzle game that casts players as botanist Arabella Greene, who despite her apparent retirement is exploring a Victorian manor in the late 19th century in order to complete her botanical research book. It's got a little bit of a Witness vibe, maybe some Blue Prince , but unlike those games (neither of which I came close to finishing) the goal in this one isn't to make you feel bad for not being smart. \"We have put a lot of thought into this game because it has a very nice peaceful setting,\" lead developer Laure De May told us in 2024 , just ahead of Bo…",

People will glom onto anything and everything that seems to be even tangentially related to Half-Life 3, and the latest rumour doing the rounds was no exception. The Valve fan account GabeFollower posted a new YouTube video claiming that this time it was actually, definitely happening, including a claim that the project is so done-and-dusted that Valve had begun moving its devs onto other projects. So far, so Sunday morning, though for whatever reason this claim was picked up and reported on by several outlets. Now: any games developer reading the above is probably laughing themselves silly.

The last ten years of Overwatch have certainly been a tumultuous ride, but I've stayed on nevertheless, because throughout it all, I always had confidence in Team 4 that they could learn from mistakes and put their best foot forward. And they have done, not only during the latest Overwatch spotlight , which blew everyone away, myself included, but multiple points over the last few years. The introduction of perks and Stadium last year, alongside map voting and hero bans , was massive for the game. Somehow Stadium manages to feel like an entirely different beast while also being approachable enough for Overwatch players to just pick up whenever, with even more changes coming soon to help its accessibility. Perks may have seemed like a small enough change, but they actually have a huge impact on how fights unfold in Overwatch.

They charge fast and can hold a lot of juice for your laptop or phone, so why wouldn't we just keep using them forever ? Well, they require lithium which has to be mined out of the Earth itself, so that won't last for all eternity. Oh, and they can explode, making them a risk when left next to your bed or in an unmanned part of a plane, so that's not ideal. Luckily, a new breakthrough means we may be able to move on from them. Enter sodium-ion batteries. As reported by Live Science , a new experiment performed by researchers at the Tokyo University of Science has yielded promising results. Lithium-ion batteries work by using a graphite cathode to store the charged lithium ions—this is what actually causes your battery to be charged. Sodium ions need hard carbon instead, and previously, it was found that the sodium ions got jammed when trying to flow into the porous material. Now, I'll admit, the electrical course in my engineering degree was so confusing I decided to switch to film and TV studies, but from what I remember, as ions ent…",

That key can then be used to decrypt files. It's like someone who spots you removing your lock from a locker and putting theirs on instead. Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back.

There are actually two types of yokai—Nurikabe and Mujina—that you can ward off using emotes. So here's what you need to do. How to emote in Nioh 3 (Image credit: Team Ninja) You can emote in Nioh 3 by pressing the right bumper and the start button on controller, or 'G' on keyboard. This will open the gesture window where you can pick from a bunch of different gestures (there are multiple pages, so no doubt an emote for every mood). Select your emote, and your character will bust a move. If you're wondering why the emotes are colour-coded, that'll come in handy for dealing with Nurikabe yokai.

This roguelike deckbuilder tasks you with racking up absurdly high point totals by whatever means necessary, whether that's filling your hand with multiples of the same card or using special math powers conferred on you by your collection of Jokers.

This is the first major update of the Visions of Eternity expansion cycle, one that—in a tweak to how previous annual expansions worked—features very little in the way of new stuff .

I know that for many gamers, it delivered the hyperfast bullet ballet they'd always wanted, but for me, it simply felt that far too much of Doom's DNA had been sacrificed in order to deliver it. Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed. A more grounded (literally) take on the classic FPS formula that, to me at least, felt far more like a spiritual successor to the legendary 1993 original. And now, thanks to id Software's 35th anniversary celebrations, Doom: The Dark Ages is over two-thirds off.

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules. As the memory supply crisis went further and further into the red, it became clear that a VRAM-stuffed Super refresh in the coming months was unlikely. The RTX 50-series cards we've tested to da…",

In a post on X , Vincke said that \"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures,\" so a series that builds on them makes perfect sense. Even more promising, despite Larian having no official involvement with the series, Mazin and co are apparently in touch with the studio: \"Craig did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us,\" wrote Vincke. \"From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope.\" Hooray!

Spoilers ahead for Fallout season 2 At the end of the first season, the levels for each of our main characters were slightly skewed, or at least not where you'd expect them to be. Despite being the main character, Lucy only managed to get to level 8, while The Ghoul sat somewhere around level 89, and Maximus managed to reach level 9. Thaddeus also somehow managed to reach level 50 after accidentally turning himself into a Ghoul (more on that later).

In charge of the show is Craig Mazin, co-creator of HBO's The Last of Us show, who says he's played \"nearly 1,000 hours\" of Baldur's Gate 3. \"I am a devoted fan of D&D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it,\" says Mazin. Deadline also reports that the writer and producer has been playing D&D weekly for the past 15 years. Aside from The Last of Us, Mazin is known for HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, as well as a handful of comedy films, including a couple of the Scary Movie parodies and the second two Hangover movies. According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3. The original BioWare RPGs are \"not official source material,\" the site says, but the show can use material from D&D's Forgotten Realms setting in general.

Here are a few universal, samurai, and ninja texts you can find early on: Text locations Type Location Warrior's Text In a small chest in the friendly camp just north of Hamamatsu Gate in…",

In particular, Burst Break is of huge importance in this fight, so I hope you've been paying attention—jokes, I'll explain how to use Burst Break down below. I'll also offer some other tips for triumphing against this spear-wielding Takeda clan warrior. After you beat Masakage, you'll complete the prologue section, and be able to enter the rest of the game for real. How to beat Yamagata Masakage in Nioh 3 Though not all that tricky, Yamagata Masakage definitely requires you to adjust to Nioh 3's combat style, in particular, the Burst Break mechanic. Using Burst Break with R (RT on controller), when Yamagata flashes red, will deal big Ki damage (the blue bar below his health), making it easier to stun him and press Y to perform a Grapple that will take a chunk of his health away. Burst Break will also change you from Ninja to Samurai or vice versa, though you can tweak this. This attack is easy to recognise since he'…",

In this way, you're encouraged to routinely swap your equipment for something shiny and new. But what you do with all your old, potentially unused gear is vital. You can sell it at a merchant, scrap it at the blacksmith, or use it as an offering at a shrine to get Amrita—souls, for all you FromSoftware knowers. But it's more complicated than it sounds, and it's easy to shortchange yourself. You might've noticed that the gear you use gains 'familiarity' as you kill enemies—it's the little progress bar at the top of the item description.

Ki is effectively your stamina, and you'll soon be breathless if you start flailing around as the samurai. So much so that I barely used the warrior early on in favour of the ninja, where I simply overwhelmed the enemy with a flurry of attacks and dodged here, there, and everywhere. The Ki Pulse is how samurai manage their stamina, requiring you to press the right bumper on a controller at the correct time during combos to recover Ki. It's a lot to keep track of, and it doesn't lead to very smooth, impactful samurai combat if you can't do it right. Plus, I'm a sucker for odachis—large, Ki-eating swords—so I was burning through stamina after just a few hits, leaving me defenceless.

    "body": "We've been able to swim around just off the coast of Rust's murder island for years now, but I'm absolutely terrified of the sharks most players seem to shrug off, so I keep myself parked on land watching from a safe distance. After today's Naval Update, I'm thinking that may change as Rust adds buildable seafaring boats, among other things. I say may because I know someone is going to immediately send my dinky ship to the bottom of the sea. Or they'll commandeer it and make me walk the plank. The player-made boats are ugly, hulking blocks of wood and metal sheets that do not look like they should be able to float, but they do. And that's what I love about them. You'll need the usual boat stuff to make one work (steering wheel, anchor, sails, engines, etc), so I'm not sure how long it'll take to hit the open sea's progression point, but I just want reassurance it's a reasonable option for solo players. Even if that means I'll have to face my fears and fistfight a shark. Floating bases offer a lot of the same features you see in land architecture, too. There are locks for steering wheels, stopping wannabe pirates from taking control of personal ships, and you can utilize any deploy…",

There's a lot to keep track of this season, and not everything is releasing all at once. To make things easier to follow, here's a breakdown of everything that's arrived in this season in Black Ops 7. (Image credit: Activision) Seven new weapons are coming to Black Ops 7 during Season 2. REV-46 SMG ERGT-17 Assault Rifle H311-SAW Melee GDL Havoc Launcher SG-12 Shotgun Voyak KT-3 Assault Rifle Swordfish A1 Marksman Rifle (Image credit: Activision) At launch, you can expect two brand-new normal guns and two special weapons. The REV-46 has the fastest fire rate of any BO7 SMG, and it looks like it'll absolutely shred anything you put in front of it. (Image credit: Activision) The ERGT-17 is another fast-firing weapon—only beaten by the Peacekeeper in fire rate— and its superheated rounds ricochet off walls for stylish kills.

(Image credit: Guerrilla Games) Combat in Horizon Hunters Gathering \"is tactical, reactive, and skill-based,\" game director Arjan Bak says later in the video. \"We took the precision and tactical depth of Horizon's combat and built it for a team environment. You'll have to read enemy movement, time your attacks, and combine abilities with your squad to take down the most powerful machines. It is a challenging game. You really have to earn that victory.\" And w…",

So, Embark is doing things a little differently for its second Expedition project that departs on March 1. \"Starting off, we want to get one announcement out of the way right off the bat: we’ve heard your feedback about the required Stash value for maximum rewards being too high, and have decided to lower the requirement to three million Coins (600k per Skill Point),\" Embark wrote in blog post published today. \"The reward will still be five skill points for reaching the three million stash value.\" That's a big discount from the five million Coins that were needed to get the full skill point bonuses in the first Expedition—or a million coins per point. Yowza, now I understand the hate.

The shooter has a couple animal heroes already: Winston, a super-intelligent gorilla, and Wrecking Ball, a mech piloted by a hamster named Hammond. On the other hand, as Reddit user mikoga points out , those heroes are protected by powerful mechanized armor. Jetpack Cat is 90% just-a-cat. \"I don't want to shoot at a normal ass cat,\" mikoga said. I hadn't really considered it before seeing that comment, but I might also not want to shoot at a normal ass cat, although there are some compelling rebuttals in the thread. Hammond may be protected by a mech suit, notes one commenter, but his little hamster body sometimes spills out of the cockpit when he's eliminated. The mech also explodes a fair bit, as I recall. That does make it hard to claim that Jetpack Cat is an aberration: Overwatch has been annihilating furballs for some time now.
