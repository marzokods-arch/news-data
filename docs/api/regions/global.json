Call of Duty has issued a full reversal on its plans to allow fantastical skins in Black Ops 7 after heavy backlash, and today, Battlefield 6 developers reaffirmed their commitment to not ending up like Fortnite. \"We want to be a gritty, realistic shooter,\" Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl told IGN in a recent interview. \"Other games can and should be whatever they want to be, right?

Developer Cloud Imperium Games recently reaffirmed a 2026 launch for Squadron 42 , Star Citizen's singleplayer campaign—the one with Gary Oldman, Gillian Anderson, and Mark Hamill —but a more recent developer's comment has sparked doubt among some fans.

Players quickly complained, and Funcom issued a response the following day. \"We realize that our communication around the contents of the DLC has not been clear enough,\" Funcom said . \"The Lost Harvest DLC has a variety of content, with the focus being on the new side story and the Treadwheel, but the way the Dune Man building pieces were communicated created expectations that it would be a full building set rather than what was our intention: four new pieces to supplement the base game…",

The regular map should return early next week. Every player starts each round with a pair of Iron Man items: one for flying and one for shooting.

It's not exactly been smooth sailing for 2K Games and Gearbox Software, the publishers and developers, as the game's overall performance is rougher than the Drake Passage. To help matters (or make things worse, depending on your point of view), 2K produced a detailed chart of what settings Nvidia GPU owners should use to get the best performance. However, most of this just involved enabling upscaling and frame generation. Borderlands 4 is just plain hard on your hardware. Especially the CPU, it would seem, because the minimum system requirements demand an '8 core (or equivalent)' processor, citing an Intel Core i7 9700 as an example. Yesterday, I tested a very similar chip , the 9700K, in a rig with a Radeon RX 5700 XT and 1080p Low quality, and the CPU was frequently hitting 100% utilisation in the open world (see below). But what if your gaming PC has a processor with fewer cores, a Core i5 or a Ryzen 5 chip, for example? Does that mean you're going to be in trouble? To find out, I've spent the day running a series of tests on two gaming PCs, where I've decreased the num…",

Balatro creator LocalThunk announced the delay today, and offered a relatable excuse: \"I'm slow.\" After apologizing for the delay, LocalThunk said he probably shouldn't have announced a release target for the 1.1 update in the first place: He's a \"hobbyist developer at heart,\" who unfortunately became \"all too familiar with the crunch and stress that inherently come with professional game development\" following the launch of Balatro in 2023.

You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay. It was kinda fun: I played a few runs, unlocked some upgrades, and experienced brief whiplash after locking eyes with two headlines about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real.

It's well, imminent: Hades 2 hits 1.0 this September 25, or 13 days from now. It'll hit Switch at the same time, should you want to play it there. You might actually want to, by the way, because one of the bells and whistles Supergiant's bringing to the game on the 25th is cross-saves. \"In v1.0, Hades II offers cross saves between the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 versions and the version here on Steam. If you've been playing in early access and wish to continue the journey on Nintendo's game consoles, you'll be able to transfer your save data through a simple in-game menu,\" quoth the announcement post . If you're staring slack-jawed at the headline, swearing up and down that Hades 2 was already out, I don't blame you. The game's been in early access for over a year now, and was already good enough that our Harvey Randall made it his personal GOTY pick for last year. So I have a sneaking suspicion the full release will probably be quite good , and no doubt we'll be along with a review when the game goes full …",

This technology, aptly-named X3D Turbo Mode 2.0, works by analysing what a chip is doing and adjusting frequency, power, core count, and balancing temperature to improve performance dynamically. Gigabyte announced the tech but the motherboards fitted with it had been a no-show. Until now. The X870E Aorus Elite X3D Ice , X870E Aorus Master X3D Ice , and X870E Aorus Pro X3D Ice are now officially available (though yet to show up at any retailer). \"Our proprietary X3D Turbo Mode 2.0 intelligently dynamically optimizes gaming performance up to 25% by built-in AI model, delivering exceptional gaming experience and productivity that adapts to your usage scenario in real-time,\" Gigabyte says. \"Up to 25%\" improvement—that's a greater improvement than the company previously note…",

Sure, the compass is useful for getting your bearings, but it's also completely useless in pinpointing enemies in combat. There's a psycho to your northeast, but they could be standing right in front of you or ten blocks away. See what I mean? Luckily, tucked away at the bottom of the 'gameplay' tab in the settings menu is the radar display .

You may recall that previous Borderlands games on Steam were review-bombed earlier this year because of changes in their EULAs. There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players. It was all a bit (or a lot) overblown, as PC Gamer's Tyler Colp pointed out: \"a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything.\" Those review bombings did indeed have little impact…",

Chatbots, the FTC said, are designed to mimic human behaviors and \"communicate like a friend or confidant, which may prompt some users, especially children and teens, to trust and form relationships with chatbots.\" Because of that, and—one would assume—the recent uptick in awful outcomes from their use, the agency wants to know what the companies that make chatbots are doing to protect their users. \"Protecting kids online is a top priority for the Trump-Vance FTC, and s…",

Meanwhile, the just-released Hollow Knight: Silksong didn't raise any performance concerns, but gamers in China were dismayed to discover that the Chinese translation was botched. Those are just a couple of the reasons some gamers have chosen to reject launch day hype in favor of \"patient gaming\": Waiting a year or more to play new games, which means getting them cheaper during a sale and playing them after a bunch of big performance and quality-of-life patches have likely made them much better than they were at launch. There's even a pretty active subreddit dedicated to the idea : the main rule is that you're not allowed to post about games that are under a year old. But there's also a reason HBO's servers sometimes struggled with Sunday night demand at the height of Game of Thrones' popularity. There's something special about being there on day one (before they edit out the Starbucks cups ) and reacting and emoting with the crowd.

The best Rafa builds in Borderlands 4 range from the typical turret playstyle all the way to the other end of the spectrum as a lightning-fast melee-only assassin. No matter what type of build you're looking for, Rafa can do it all; I'd say he's the most diverse Vault Hunter of the bunch. Below, I'll go over three different Rafa builds at max level , covering the skills, augments, capstones, and gear to pick up for them. Best Rafa builds in Borderlands 4 Rafa's three skill trees are arguably the most distinct from each other than any other Vault Hunter in BL4, as each one specialises in something completely different: Remote Agent : Rafa's most gun-focused skill tree, with tons of buffs to your DPS (many of which also improve your shoulder-mounted Peacebreaker Cannons). There's a branch specifically for indirect projectiles, which is great for Tediore and Jakobs weapons (or weapon parts). There's also a major emphasis on Overdrive bonuses. This Year's Gimmick : Almost entirely designed for melee,…",

Oddly enough, Harlowe feels the most like the traditional Siren we've come to know, more so than the best Vex builds , despite her reliance on tech. Nevertheless, the Gravitar brings much more to the table than you'd initially expect, so I'll go over three of the best Harlowe builds at max level below. I'll cover the skills, augments, and capstones to pick, alongside gear that works with them to make this character shine. Best Harlowe builds in Borderlands 4 Harlowe has three unique skill trees, each with their own associated action skill, just like the other Vault Hunters in Borderlands 4: Creative Bursts : Focuses on Harlowe's Chroma Accellerator, dealing elemental damage, causing status effects, and action skill spamming. There are also many perks that boost weapon DPS, whether through rate of fire, elemental buffs (radiation or cryo), or straight-up damage increases.

Unfortunately, you're restrained by how many skill points you can earn, which is based on the current max level , so you can't splash the cash and unlock every power. Below, I'll go over the max level in Borderlands 4 and how many skill points you can expect to earn right now, so you can properly plan out your characters ' builds. However, I'll also discuss whether we can expect this to increase in the future. What is the max level in Borderlands 4? The max level in Borderlands 4 is 50 , giving you a total of 49 skill points to spend across your three skill trees. Every five skill points you spend unlocks the next layer of the skill tree, apart from the final tier, which requires an extra point to get the final perk. In other words, you could almost reach the end of two skill trees if you're being efficient, though that's not really optimal for most builds. There are a few key features related to your progression: You'll start encountering loot drops with Firmware as early as level 25 (these are effectively gear sets).

And two, you're about to see how that card can be outfitted with an astonishing 48 GB of VRAM and come out of the experience working correctly, a process I only thought possible with dark arts, witchcraft, and a sacrifice made to the silicon gods. But whaddaya know, it turns out it's actually reasonably achievable, as demonstrated by our host, Vik-on (via Videocardz ). While plenty of modders have strapped more memory modules to graphics cards in the past, it's usually been a technical exercise, rather than creating a genuinely useable GPU at the end of it. Vik-on, however, looks to have been able to double the VRAM capacity of their RTX 4090 successfully with relative ease. Key to this achievement is a leaked Nvidia BIOS, which gives our modder the ability to force support for different capacities and amounts of memory modules using Ada-generation chips. Making the graphics chip itself play nicely with more memory, though, is only half the battle. The new modules also need to physically connect wi…",

This is a classy case, and, whether it's aimed at pro creators or pro gamers, one that many should consider for their next build—but not without some caveats. The initial draw of the PA401? Real wood. You know you've made it when your PC case was once alive. Each of the slats over the front intake on the PA401 is made from (sustainably sourced) ash with a glossy finish. So glossy, in fact, the grain is far less noticeable compared to the Fractal Design Terra or North. It's almost indistinguishable from plastic unless you're right up to it. Personally, I like it. The understated wood effect fits with the diminutive design across the rest of the case. But other members of the PC Gamer team thought it needed a little more pizazz. Altogether a simple case to build into, the ProArt stands out for the smaller details.
