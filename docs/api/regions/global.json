The minister and civil rights leader, who was assassinated in April 1968, was known in his lifetime for his advocacy of nonviolent resistance, civil disobedience, and sonorous eloquence. Sora has been used to produce videos featuring Dr. King's likeness delivering the \"I have a dream\" speech while making monkey noises ; another video shows him fighting his contemporary and fellow activist Malcolm X. OpenAI has admitted this sort of stuff amounts to \"disrespectful depictions\", which is putting it mildly, and says it's stopped users being able to generate videos featuring Dr. King's likeness \"as it strengthens guardrails for historical figures.\" Dr. King is far from the only historical figure to have been reanimated in oft-tasteless fashion. There are videos of JFK's likeness joking about the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk; one showing Kobe Bryant's likeness on a helicopter with the implication this is from the 2020 crash that killed him, his daughter, and seven others; yet more show Malcolm X's like…",

The answer came in July 2025 when Sony filed suit , shortly after which Tencent did something unusual: It purged most of the Horizon-like content from the game's Steam page, and delayed its launch target from late 2025 to late 2027—all without saying a word about why, or even acknowledging it was being done at all. The \"why\" seemed obvious enough: Light of Motiram really did look an awful lot like Horizon: Zero Dawn, in some very overt ways. Despite Tencent's lack of comment, I assumed the store page changes, and the huge two-year delay, represented a fairly complete walkback and rework. But it seems that Sony isn't buying it: As reported by Games Fray , Sony has now filed for a preliminary injunction against Tencent's use of any material \"copied or derived\" from the Horizon games. That covers a lot of ground, but the filing focuses heavily on Tencent's use of a character in Light of Motiram promotional images who looks a lot like Alo…",

There's joy to be found in mundane retail work when your real-life livelihood doesn't depend on enduring its regular horrors. While surveying the top demos of this month's Next Fest , however, I couldn't help but notice that there's a sudden rash of upcoming games all intent on making simulated retail work worse. By my count, there are currently at least four different games in development about operating convenience stores while surviving—or in some cases, facilitating—a variety of interplanetary, unholy, and undead terrors.

It arrives December 3 and the early signs are very positive: Blizzard may well have dragged its feet over adding a feature that much of the competition already has but, as PCG's Harvey Randall points out, it's also been able to learn from two decades of others' mistakes . Needless to say, part of this new housing system is furniture. When the housing system launches, players will earn decor relating to achievements and existing in-game content: but this will also work retroactively, so achievements earned now will count toward furniture when housing goes live. The housing system is already live on WoW's Public Test Realm for the early birds, so players know what these achievements are. I'm sure you can see where this is going. A new add-on called Home Bound by Bettiold ( available on CurseForge ) essentially tells players which achievements they should be gunning for in the runup to the release of the full housing system, whereupon they'll be showered with all their hard-earned furniture.

They just do their thing and we rarely give them a moment's thought, until they ruin a Steam download, of course. I felt very much the same way until I recently reviewed three new devices from TP-Link: two mesh systems, the Deco BE68 and Deco BE25 BE5000 , and the Archer BE9700 . Using two Intel Core Ultra 200S gaming PCs to test the wireless performance of them, I came away seriously impressed by just how easy they were to set up, how ridiculously quick they were, and perhaps most importantly, how affordable they were compared to the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 gaming routers. Take the Archer BE9700. You can buy one of those for $200 at Best Buy . That's genuinely very little money for such a capable Wi-Fi 7 router.

That's where a server slam—a stress test with a catchier name—comes in: The goal is to hammer the infrastructure as hard as possible to see how it holds up. It's not a guarantee of a smooth-sailing launch day (Dune: Awakening also reminded us of that ), but it's at least an attempt, and also a way of rooting out any overlooked issues that might trigger surprise headaches.

The term 'AI PC' has always been a struggle to define, ranging from Microsoft's earlier assertion that an AI PC must have an NPU with at least 45 TOPS of processing power to meet the qualification (that rules out most AMD-chipped desktop machines, then) to whether it's got a physical Copilot button on the keyboard. The good news is, MS seems to think we'll all have an AI PC soon, thanks to Copilot. Well, as long as you're running the latest version of Windows 11, that is. If I were a cynical man, I'd say it was almost like the term had no viable definition in the first place and merely served as a marketing tool to boost new PC sales.

You play a luckless French soldier, Henri Clement, who finds himself in a very unusual bunker on the Western Front during World War 1. The game is semi open world and has randomised elements but what it really gets right, and I will try to avoid spoilers, is the AI of the monster that will be chasing you down. This game is scary in a way that very few horror games have ever managed , because it's surprising and brilliant at catching you off-guard. The monster, called the Stalker, moves around the bunker via man-sized tunnels in the walls, which Clement can't use, and the best-in-class audio makes the approaching scratches and yawps absolutely pant-wetting.

This move was immediately greeted by an unprecedented surge of angry chatter. Honestly, I was quite shocked at just how quickly the community rallied on a random Wednesday to voice their concerns. The lesson here is: don't mess with Battlefield's traditional mode, or you'll be met with pitchforks. After all, people complaining about Conquest matches ending due to the time expiring and not down-to-the-wire battles of attrition weren't annoyed by the tickets; they were annoyed by the timer . Announced just after promising overhauls to Battlefield 6's currently slow progression systems, Battlefield Studios has confirmed its reverting the controversial ticket change: \"We've heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45-minute timed rounds.\" This was followed…",

YouTuber RandomGaminginHD has put the AMD Radeon RX 570 to the test in Battlefield 6, and the 2017 graphics card holds up surprisingly well (via PCMR subreddit ). Surprisingly well, that is, compared to just not working at all or being entirely unplayable, which is what I would have expected for such an old card in most modern, good-looking games. We do, the YouTuber explains, need to make \"some pretty big visual sacrifices\" to achieve a relatively solid 60 fps. To my eyes, though, those visual sacrifices aren't ones that make the game unplayable. They essentially mean dropping the resolution down low, which will, of course, make the game look quite jagged and pixelated, but even on the lowest settings, the actual visuals, such as textures, still seem to look half-decent. The AMD Radeon RX 570 has just 4 GB of VRAM, but Battlefield 6 doesn't use more than this when it's set to the lowest settings at 1080p.

In essence, the patch updates the PC version of the game to match the console editions released in March this year.

The C2S-Scale 27B model was tasked with finding a drug that could act as a conditional amplifier, or something capable of boosting the immune signal in an environment where low levels of interferon , an immune-signalling protein, were already present—but crucially, not in significant enough quantities to trigger the immune system into doing its job. Essentially, it was looking for a drug that could turn a \"cold\" tumour \"hot\", or susceptible to immunotherapy, when interferon was already in the mix.

It's a noticeably cheaper-feeling headset than the comparably priced Corsair HS55 (this is before mentioning that Corsair's offering is older and regularly reduced). It creaks under pressure, and the speakers in the earcups aren't even padded, meaning you can tap plastic if you poke your finger in there. However, partially due to its choice of materials, the Logitech G321 certainly earns that Lightspeed name by being some of the most breezy cups I've wrapped around my ears as of late. The best way I can think to enunciate what the G321 Lightspeed gets right is to express what I think the Turtle Beach Recon 70 gets wrong. The Recon 70 is a decidedly budget headset at $40, and the headset makes a lot of compromises in regards to build quality and feel. The G321 is $10 more, comes with the same-sized drivers (40 mm), a flip-to-mute microphone, a similar weight, and yet, it feels so much better on the head. It's also wireless. At 210 g, it's not that much lighter than the 231 g Turtle Beach Recon 70 and yet putting both on, a clear winner arises. That's because the parts of the G321 Lightspeed that …",

That is, if the community's to be believed. See, during the Battlefield 6 beta, jumping and sliding was significantly nerfed to ensure the game didn't devolve into a Titanfall-esque parkour fest, where the newest generation (with their intact reflexes and youthful spirit and hair, grumble grumble) wouldn't simply clown on long-time series fans because they know how to b-hop or knife-boost or whatever these dang kids are calling it nowadays. The question remains, however, whether DICE went overboard. As user Jean Martin on X asks principal game designer Florian Le Bihan (thanks, GamesRadar+ ): \"'Zoomers' were liking movements in the beta. In the release 'battledads' like the movement. Can we get an inbetween to please all the community?

Weapon XP, on the other hand, is frustratingly slow, which has only exacerbated tensions around the random bullet deviation epidemic that even the best guns suffer from. Thankfully, Battlefield Studios has answered our calls and is implementing a number of substantial changes to quicken the pace of progression: \"Our goals here are to make the progression experience feel smoother and more rewarding while still keeping that sense of achievement when you complete a milestone like fully mastering a weapon.\" These changes were originally signalled to go live within the next week, but are surprisingly already being implemented across all platforms. Most importantly, the XP required to get any given gun to level 20 is being reduced, so you can start earning vital attachments \"almost twice as fast\".

Revealed at Sim Racing Expo 2025 in Dortmund, Assetto Corsa Rally will launch into Steam early access on November 13, and has some impressive boasts to its name. For one, it’s the first rally title ever to feature laser-scanned stages. While it’s increasingly common for racing sim developers to visit racing circuit and laser-scan them to capture the minute details of the track surface, the trackside furniture and the precise topography, nobody’s ever attempted such a feat in loose surface racing sims before. In fact, rally games don’t generally even replicate real rally stages on a 1:1 basis, laser-scanned or not. EA WRC, a fine game in its own right, featured sections of stages that were authentic to their real-life counterpart, but they weren’t laser-scanned. That single detail underlines the ambition here, which is simply to be the most accurate and authentic rally sim ever released. The vehicle roster will ex…",

    "body": "Here's a conundrum to start this review: When is a Wi-Fi 7 networking device not really a Wi-Fi 7 networking device? The answer is when it's the TP-Link Deco BE25. It might seem very harsh to start things so negatively, but it's best to get the most important point about this home mesh system out of the way first. Basically, unlike most Wi-Fi 7 routers and mesh networks, the Deco BE25 doesn't support the 6 GHz band or the 320 MHz channel. You just get 2.4 and 5 GHz, plus a maximum 240 MHz channel, making it not better than an average Wi-Fi 6 system. On paper, at least, because the little wireless hubs have a trick or two to make up for it all. If you're unfamiliar with the term 'home mesh system', it's basically a group of synchronised Wi-Fi routers that work together to create a broader and seamless wireless network. Have poor Wi-Fi in your basement or attic bedroom? Then a mesh setup is ideal for you. However, most systems seem to be extremely expensive, and that's certainly true for the high-end models. TP-Link's Deco BE25 is at the other end of the spectrum, with an MSRP of $300, but it typically sells for $209 to $230 . That's for a three-node pack, making each unit as little…",

That's all because such rigs sport ultra-fast Wi-Fi 7 adapters, and if you've got a web connection that's 1 Gbps or faster, you'll surely be wanting to enjoy some mighty quick Steam downloads, if your home is wirelessly networked. What's probably stopping you is the price of a typical Wi-Fi 7 router: Netgear's Nighthawk RS600 is $400, and even its slower RS300 model is $329, while Asus is asking $350 for its RT-BE88U , and that doesn't support the full Wi-Fi 7 feature list. So if I tell you that the TP-Link Archer BE9700 has every Wi-Fi 7 trick in the book, five fast LAN ports, an easy-to-use interface, and costs just $200 , does that make you change your mind? It certainly made me pause for thought and wonder if we have a new contender for the best gaming router you can buy right now. Jumping the gun somewhat, I have to say now that the Archer BE9700 isn't the outright best one around, as it's nowhere near as fast as most of the top-end routers on the market, and it's not…",

I say 'routers' because that's just one part of what's inside: you've also got a WAP (wireless access point) and a network switch. But regardless of what you call the TP-Link Deco BE68 BE14000, you're getting a very capable device for providing super-fast Wi-Fi 7 in every nook and cranny of your home. You can buy the system as a two or three-pack, and even just use a single unit (or node, to use the correct term), but we're reviewing the $700 triple node offering here. TP-Link claims up to 8,100 square feet (753 square metres) of coverage with three nodes (6,000 for two and 3,100 for one), which far exceeds the dimensions of a typical home, be it in the UK or the USA. However, if you have a large property with buildings widely separated, that 8,100 square feet of coverage might come in very handy. The Deco BE68 sits roughly in the middle of TP-Link's Wi-Fi 7 home mesh range due to its maximum speed rating of BE14000. That number refers to the peak data transfer s…",

Here we are, howling at the moon for decades-old modes, \"grounded\" character models, classic class setups, and a map from 2011. Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 has impressed me. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year.

I knew from the first time I got my hands on it last year that it had the potential to be the kind of game MMO players have wanted for a long time—including me. And Fellowship just kept improving each time I saw it. The pitch is simple: It's MMO-style dungeons but without the MMO grind. You party up in a group of four—one tank, one healer, two damage-dealers—and work together to clear out packs of enemies and bosses for better and better loot. There's no need to level up a character and churn through hundreds of quests. You pick one of the game's MOBA-like heroes, queue up, and spam dungeons for as long as you'd like. It's one of those ideas that I am surprised nobody really capitalized on for this long. There are plenty of World of Warcraft players who play the game purely for the thrill of grouping up and doing dungeons. Fellowship is trying to fill a niche that surprisingly doesn't really exist elsewhere. And that's what drove Chief Rebel to make Fellowship as its first game.

A time when nobody expected you to have the right models because half the things in the rulebook didn't even have models yet. That said, the first edition of Warhammer 40,000 was supposedly a complete mess rules-wise—borderline unplayable without a degree from Wargame University. How true are these things?

But while Ubisoft said it was \"deeply grateful\" for his impact on the Assassin's Creed games and \"saddened to see him go,\" it was also apparently the company's idea that he leave. \"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it,\" Côté wrote in an emotional, occasionally gutting message posted on LinkedIn . \"The truth is simple: I did not make that choice. \"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.

Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins provided an ominous-sounding \" seven days notice \" last week that this would be a \"larger\" patch, making changes \"to specific gear and those unintended interactions.\" Foremost among those interactions is a throwing knife that, when combined with a particular passive, becomes what PC Gamer's Harvey Randall called an \" infinite bleed god-knife \" capable of killing the hell out of pretty much anything. The knife was no secret: Timmins said in September that \"we’ve seen the discourse about builds that use unintended interactions and/or …",

A quick catch-up for those who missed the drama that brought us to this point: Ubisoft shut down servers for The Crew in April 2024, rendering the game unplayable and triggering a furious consumer backlash in the process. Ubisoft's ham-fisted handling of the situation didn't help smooth the waters, but it did get the message, promising in September of that year to bring offline support to The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest . Testing for The Crew 2's offline mode began earlier this year, and as of today it's fully live. \"With this update, players can now switch between the original online experience of The Crew 2 and a brand-new offline mode, letting you enjoy the game even without an internet connection,\" Ubisoft said. \"This represents a major milestone in our ongoing commitment to ensuring long-term access to The Crew 2 for all players.\" After the new update is installed, players will be prompted t…",

All told, it's \"the biggest launch in franchise history ,\" EA said, and enough of a win that even Battlefield boss Vince Zampella, whose frustrations with technical troubles boiled over publicly during Battlefield 6's launch, is all smiles now. \"We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point,\" Zampella said. \"We appreciate you joining us for Battlefield 6’s momentous launch.

While Dwarf Fortress history is dense with elaborate defensive superstructures like weaponized magma flows, pits full of war bears, and the trusty dwarven atom smasher , the underlying strategy has been defined by a simple principle: Goblin war hosts can only follow the paths you leave open. As a result, if the only way into your fortress is a meat grinder of boulder traps, sawblades, and entrenched dwarven infantry, goblin besiegers have had no choice but to march headlong into red ruin. Once the siege update lands in a couple weeks, however, invading forces will be leveling the playing field.
