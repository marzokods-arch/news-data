As is the drill for a party of RPG misfits, your companions in Outer Worlds 2 will have their own faction loyalties, backgrounds, skills, and storylines that you can affect with your choices. Those details are pretty thin on the ground right now though. We know a lot less about TOW2's crew than we did about Avowed's in its launch month earlier this year. Here's what we know so far though: names, factions, and a bit of snark about their abilities. Can you romance your companions in The Outer Worlds 2? Nope. You can't kiss your companions in The Outer Worlds 2. That's standard for Obsidian at this point though. There also weren't romances in Avowed (except there was kind of that Kai romance in Avowed ).

One other reason to get excited is Sports Interactive's deal with the English Premier League, arguably the greatest club league in the world, and now it has announced another biggie: a multi-year deal with FIFA , football's world governing body, that gives FM 26 and its successors the license to multiple international competitions, most notably FIFA World Cup 26. The World Cup is obviously as big as sport gets, and next year's competition will be held across Canada, Mexico, and the USA. Qualification for the tournament remains ongoing, but last week saw a rampant and swashbuckling Scotland guarantee themselves a play off spot at the minimum, with automatic qualification still a possibility.

Needless to say, part of this new housing system is furniture. When the housing system launches, players will earn decor relating to achievements and existing in-game content: but this will also work retroactively, so achievements earned now will count toward furniture when housing goes live. The housing system is already live on WoW's Public Test Realm for the early birds, so players know what these achievements are. I'm sure you can see where this is going. A new add-on called Home Bound by Bettiold ( available on CurseForge ) essentially tells players which achievements they should be gunning for in the runup to the release of the full housing system, whereupon they'll be showered with all their hard-earned furniture.

They just do their thing and we rarely give them a moment's thought, until they ruin a Steam download, of course. I felt very much the same way until I recently reviewed three new devices from TP-Link: two mesh systems, the Deco BE68 and Deco BE25 BE5000 , and the Archer BE9700 . Using two Intel Core Ultra 200S gaming PCs to test the wireless performance of them, I came away seriously impressed by just how easy they were to set up, how ridiculously quick they were, and perhaps most importantly, how affordable they were compared to the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 gaming routers. Take the Archer BE9700. You can buy one of those for $200 at Best Buy . That's genuinely very little money for such a capable Wi-Fi 7 router.

Game servers for big, anticipated new releases have a nasty tendency of crumbling under the load of a big launch day, as Dune: Awakening reminded us earlier this year. That's where a server slam—a stress test with a catchier name—comes in: The goal is to hammer the infrastructure as hard as possible to see how it holds up. It's not a guarantee of a smooth-sailing launch day (Dune: Awakening also reminded us of that ), but it's at least an attempt, and also a way of rooting out any overlooked issues that might trigger surprise headaches.

The company released a statement on X confirming the erroneous minting of coins, describing it as an internal technical error. \"There is no security breach,\" the post continues. \"Customer funds are safe.

A handheld gaming PC that goes a long way to ironing out many of the kinks inherent in Windows-based devices, but does so with what I believe is a fundamental misunderstanding of why people buy handhelds in the first place. At its heart, it's a new version of the Asus handheld, but with a new AMD APU inside and a reskinned, reimagined version of Windows on top. And both are improvements over what's gone before. But Microsoft, having ditched its own plans for an in-house handheld, has slapped an Xbox badge on it and is now asking gamers to pay far more than they have for any Xbox console that has ever existed.

More specifically, \"AI-automated phishing emails achieved 54% click-through rates compared to 12% for standard attempts\" because \"AI enables more targeted phishing and better phishing lures.\" The bulk of the data from the report is collected from Microsoft's fiscal year 2025, from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. In addition, \"AI automation has the potential to increase phishing profitability by up to 50 times by scaling highly targeted attacks to thousands of targets at minimal cost.

Cool. What's slightly troubling, however, is its declaration that it's \"making every Windows 11 PC an AI PC.\" Oh fiddlesticks. Don't make me go through all this again. The term 'AI PC' has always been a struggle to define, ranging from Microsoft's earlier assertion that an AI PC must have an NPU with at least 45 TOPS of processing power to meet the qualification (that rules out most AMD-chipped desktop machines, then) to whether it's got a physical Copilot button on the keyboard. The good news is, MS seems to think we'll all have an AI PC soon, thanks to Copilot. Well, as long as you're running the latest version of Windows 11, that is. If I were a cynical man, I'd say it was almost like the term had no viable definition in the first place and merely served as a marketing tool to boost new PC sales.

It doesn't have hyper-realistic graphics; it doesn't have crafting; it doesn't have a battle pass; it doesn't even have humans.

Leave it to Double Fine, the developer that made a level out of psychedelic album art in Psychonauts 2, to create an entire experience that feels like exploring a surrealist painting: a trip through a hazy alien-looking planet that glows with pinks and greens and oranges, starring a sentient lighthouse with spider legs.

This game is scary in a way that very few horror games have ever managed , because it's surprising and brilliant at catching you off-guard. The monster, called the Stalker, moves around the bunker via man-sized tunnels in the walls, which Clement can't use, and the best-in-class audio makes the approaching scratches and yawps absolutely pant-wetting.

This move was immediately greeted by an unprecedented surge of angry chatter. Honestly, I was quite shocked at just how quickly the community rallied on a random Wednesday to voice their concerns. The lesson here is: don't mess with Battlefield's traditional mode, or you'll be met with pitchforks. After all, people complaining about Conquest matches ending due to the time expiring and not down-to-the-wire battles of attrition weren't annoyed by the tickets; they were annoyed by the timer . Announced just after promising overhauls to Battlefield 6's currently slow progression systems, Battlefield Studios has confirmed its reverting the controversial ticket change: \"We've heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45-minute timed rounds.\" This was followed…",

Surprisingly well, that is, compared to just not working at all or being entirely unplayable, which is what I would have expected for such an old card in most modern, good-looking games. We do, the YouTuber explains, need to make \"some pretty big visual sacrifices\" to achieve a relatively solid 60 fps. To my eyes, though, those visual sacrifices aren't ones that make the game unplayable. They essentially mean dropping the resolution down low, which will, of course, make the game look quite jagged and pixelated, but even on the lowest settings, the actual visuals, such as textures, still seem to look half-decent. The AMD Radeon RX 570 has just 4 GB of VRAM, but Battlefield 6 doesn't use more than this when it's set to the lowest settings at 1080p.

And people have been waiting for your return. You wake up in 21st century Seattle, bound by a curse and weighed down by the expectations of modern bloodsuckers. Amid all this, you must carve out a place for yourself in this new city, along with an identity, even as you're nudged into deals and alliances, bending and adapting as you try to become what Seattle's nighttime residents need: a big scary vamp who can fix everything. Or break everything. The story of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2's lost protagonist eerily encapsulates the state of the game itself: a long-awaited sequel with years of hopes and doubts and assumptions bearing down on it; an RPG that has to be an RPG, has to be a sequel, that strains against its bonds.

However, this one may well be worth paying attention to, as it's already revealed a promising new cancer treatment method—which Google describes as \"a milestone for AI in science.\" As Google's blog post details, a major challenge in cancer immunotherapy is the existence of \"cold\" tumors, or tumors that are essentially invisible to the body's immune system. The C2S-Scale 27B model was tasked with finding a drug that could act as a conditional amplifier, or something capable of boosting the immune signal in an environment where low levels of interferon , an immune-signalling protein, were already present—but crucially, not in significant enough quantities to trigger the immune system into doing its job. Essentially, it was looking for a drug that could turn a \"cold\" tumour \"hot\", or susceptible to immunotherapy, when interferon was already in the mix. The model simulated the effect of over 4,000 drugs through what the researchers refer to as a \"dual-context virtual screen.\" This had two sta…",

It's a noticeably cheaper-feeling headset than the comparably priced Corsair HS55 (this is before mentioning that Corsair's offering is older and regularly reduced). It creaks under pressure, and the speakers in the earcups aren't even padded, meaning you can tap plastic if you poke your finger in there. However, partially due to its choice of materials, the Logitech G321 certainly earns that Lightspeed name by being some of the most breezy cups I've wrapped around my ears as of late. The best way I can think to enunciate what the G321 Lightspeed gets right is to express what I think the Turtle Beach Recon 70 gets wrong. The Recon 70 is a decidedly budget headset at $40, and the headset makes a lot of compromises in regards to build quality and feel. The G321 is $10 more, comes with the same-sized drivers (40 mm), a flip-to-mute microphone, a similar weight, and yet, it feels so much better on the head. It's also wireless. At 210 g, it's not that much lighter than the 231 g Turtle Beach Recon 70 and yet putting both on, a clear winner arises. That's because the parts of the G321 Lightspeed that …",

See, during the Battlefield 6 beta, jumping and sliding was significantly nerfed to ensure the game didn't devolve into a Titanfall-esque parkour fest, where the newest generation (with their intact reflexes and youthful spirit and hair, grumble grumble) wouldn't simply clown on long-time series fans because they know how to b-hop or knife-boost or whatever these dang kids are calling it nowadays.

Thankfully, Battlefield Studios has answered our calls and is implementing a number of substantial changes to quicken the pace of progression: \"Our goals here are to make the progression experience feel smoother and more rewarding while still keeping that sense of achievement when you complete a milestone like fully mastering a weapon.\" These changes were originally signalled to go live within the next week, but are surprisingly already being implemented across all platforms. Most importantly, the XP required to get any given gun to level 20 is being reduced, so you can start earning vital attachments \"almost twice as fast\".

While it’s increasingly common for racing sim developers to visit racing circuit and laser-scan them to capture the minute details of the track surface, the trackside furniture and the precise topography, nobody’s ever attempted such a feat in loose surface racing sims before. In fact, rally games don’t generally even replicate real rally stages on a 1:1 basis, laser-scanned or not. EA WRC, a fine game in its own right, featured sections of stages that were authentic to their real-life counterpart, but they weren’t laser-scanned. That single detail underlines the ambition here, which is simply to be the most accurate and authentic rally sim ever released. The vehicle roster will ex…",

Although the game is already multiplayer, this update will pit you and your friends against each other in a set of trials, rather than teaming up against the ghastly terrors in the facility. Don't get me wrong, you'll still have to fight against the villains you're used to, like Mother Gooseberry and Lelan Coyle, but you'll have additional threats to worry about too. Here's what you need to know about the Invasion update so you can prepare yourself now for when your friends quite literally stab you in the back. When does the Invasion update release for The Outlast Trials? The Outlast Trials Invasion update will be released on Tuesday, October 21 , so if you've been waiting for the perfect spooky game to play with your friends, this update couldn't really come out at a better time. What does the Invasion update include in The Outlast Trials? The Invasion update will add a PvP game mode to The Outlast Trials, which can be accessed through the terminal in the Sleep Room.

    "body": "Here's a conundrum to start this review: When is a Wi-Fi 7 networking device not really a Wi-Fi 7 networking device? The answer is when it's the TP-Link Deco BE25. It might seem very harsh to start things so negatively, but it's best to get the most important point about this home mesh system out of the way first. Basically, unlike most Wi-Fi 7 routers and mesh networks, the Deco BE25 doesn't support the 6 GHz band or the 320 MHz channel. You just get 2.4 and 5 GHz, plus a maximum 240 MHz channel, making it not better than an average Wi-Fi 6 system. On paper, at least, because the little wireless hubs have a trick or two to make up for it all. If you're unfamiliar with the term 'home mesh system', it's basically a group of synchronised Wi-Fi routers that work together to create a broader and seamless wireless network. Have poor Wi-Fi in your basement or attic bedroom? Then a mesh setup is ideal for you. However, most systems seem to be extremely expensive, and that's certainly true for the high-end models. TP-Link's Deco BE25 is at the other end of the spectrum, with an MSRP of $300, but it typically sells for $209 to $230 . That's for a three-node pack, making each unit as little…",

    "body": "If you've just bought a new gaming PC or upgraded your current one to an AMD Ryzen 9000-series or Intel Core Ultra 200S setup, there's a good chance you'll be considering an upgrade to your Internet router, too. That's all because such rigs sport ultra-fast Wi-Fi 7 adapters, and if you've got a web connection that's 1 Gbps or faster, you'll surely be wanting to enjoy some mighty quick Steam downloads, if your home is wirelessly networked. What's probably stopping you is the price of a typical Wi-Fi 7 router: Netgear's Nighthawk RS600 is $400, and even its slower RS300 model is $329, while Asus is asking $350 for its RT-BE88U , and that doesn't support the full Wi-Fi 7 feature list. So if I tell you that the TP-Link Archer BE9700 has every Wi-Fi 7 trick in the book, five fast LAN ports, an easy-to-use interface, and costs just $200 , does that make you change your mind? It certainly made me pause for thought and wonder if we have a new contender for the best gaming router you can buy right now. Jumping the gun somewhat, I have to say now that the Archer BE9700 isn't the outright best one around, as it's nowhere near as fast as most of the top-end routers on the market, and it's not…",

    "body": "Home mesh systems might sound like a whole new world of wireless technology, but they're really just two or more 'routers' that can transfer data between themselves, allowing for a greater wireless coverage in your house. I say 'routers' because that's just one part of what's inside: you've also got a WAP (wireless access point) and a network switch. But regardless of what you call the TP-Link Deco BE68 BE14000, you're getting a very capable device for providing super-fast Wi-Fi 7 in every nook and cranny of your home. You can buy the system as a two or three-pack, and even just use a single unit (or node, to use the correct term), but we're reviewing the $700 triple node offering here. TP-Link claims up to 8,100 square feet (753 square metres) of coverage with three nodes (6,000 for two and 3,100 for one), which far exceeds the dimensions of a typical home, be it in the UK or the USA. However, if you have a large property with buildings widely separated, that 8,100 square feet of coverage might come in very handy. The Deco BE68 sits roughly in the middle of TP-Link's Wi-Fi 7 home mesh range due to its maximum speed rating of BE14000. That number refers to the peak data transfer s…",

Here we are, howling at the moon for decades-old modes, \"grounded\" character models, classic class setups, and a map from 2011. Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 has impressed me. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year.

And Fellowship just kept improving each time I saw it. The pitch is simple: It's MMO-style dungeons but without the MMO grind. You party up in a group of four—one tank, one healer, two damage-dealers—and work together to clear out packs of enemies and bosses for better and better loot. There's no need to level up a character and churn through hundreds of quests. You pick one of the game's MOBA-like heroes, queue up, and spam dungeons for as long as you'd like. It's one of those ideas that I am surprised nobody really capitalized on for this long. There are plenty of World of Warcraft players who play the game purely for the thrill of grouping up and doing dungeons. Fellowship is trying to fill a niche that surprisingly doesn't really exist elsewhere. And that's what drove Chief Rebel to make Fellowship as its first game.

A time when nobody expected you to have the right models because half the things in the rulebook didn't even have models yet. That said, the first edition of Warhammer 40,000 was supposedly a complete mess rules-wise—borderline unplayable without a degree from Wargame University. How true are these things?

Testing for The Crew 2's offline mode began earlier this year, and as of today it's fully live. \"With this update, players can now switch between the original online experience of The Crew 2 and a brand-new offline mode, letting you enjoy the game even without an internet connection,\" Ubisoft said. \"This represents a major milestone in our ongoing commitment to ensuring long-term access to The Crew 2 for all players.\" After the new update is installed, players will be prompted t…",

While Dwarf Fortress history is dense with elaborate defensive superstructures like weaponized magma flows, pits full of war bears, and the trusty dwarven atom smasher , the underlying strategy has been defined by a simple principle: Goblin war hosts can only follow the paths you leave open. As a result, if the only way into your fortress is a meat grinder of boulder traps, sawblades, and entrenched dwarven infantry, goblin besiegers have had no choice but to march headlong into red ruin. Once the siege update lands in a couple weeks, however, invading forces will be leveling the playing field.

Monsters will be meaner and your gear will be more customizable to help you face them. Old systems are returning in new ways and leaderboards are finally back. The change with the most impact—and the most risk of under-delivering—is with combat. Blizzard says monster behavior was “too predictable,” in a draft of a blog post it provided to PC Gamer, and that it’s tweaking things to give each demon a stronger identity. On paper, this sounds like Diablo 4 combat might actually require some target priority, like taking care of a caster in the backline before the tank in the front. I’ve mindlessly torn through enough dungeons in the last few years to be a little skeptical about how much this will shift the feel of combat when your character is fully geared, but it sounds promising.

By some common measures, it's no faster than another small box based on AMD's Strix Halo chip that's available for about half the price. Ouch. Much of this comes down to the minor matter of floating point math precision. I can feel your eyes glazing over, but bear with me. The finer details aren't that important. All you really need to know is that lowering the floating point precision being used can speed up performance at the cost of eventual AI model accuracy. Oh, and that like all Nvidia hardware based on its latest Blackwell technology, the DGX Spark has special optimisations for the lowest and fastest tier of floating point math, known as FP4. In the simplest possible terms, you'll get better results from your AI model with a higher precision like FP8, but it'll run slower. And a lot slower than a GPU with FP4 optimisations. With all that in mind, how does DGX Spark stack up and how does it compared with AMD's Strix Halo chip? Right out of the, er, little gold box, it's worth noting that a DGX Spark w…",

Itagaki was an absolutely transformative figure in contemporary action games thanks to his work at Tecmo, the company he joined in 1992: he led Team Ninja and spearheaded the revival of Ninja Gaiden, as well as creating the Dead or Alive series. He would leave Tecmo under a cloud in 2008, before founding Valhalla Game Studios and releasing Devil's Third on Wii U. Itagaki was known for his sunglasses, pockmarked skin and outspoken interviews, but it was the fact that he and Team Ninja could back up the bluster that made him one of the great creators of the early 2000s. The first 3D Ninja Gaiden, released in 2004, took on Capcom and DMC at its own game and, by my reckoning anyway, beat it handily. That and Ninja Gaiden 2 remain two of the finest hack-and-slash games ever made. The news of Itagaki's death comes from a post to his Facebook page , and PCG has been able to confirm the news via a personal friend of the late developer. That post is titled \"Words to Leave\" and begins, via machine translation: The light of my life is about to run out. The fact that this sentence has been posted means it's finally time. …",

While strategy RPG fans have been eating good for the last few years with the entire genre having a tactical renaissance on PC , Tactics looms above them all, a mythic figure every bit as compelling as Delita, Ramza, and Thunder God Cid, but not everyone can be a legendary armor-busting sword deity. Most of your rank and file allies have everyday Tactics jobs to earn enough to feed their families fresh Chocobo drumsticks.
