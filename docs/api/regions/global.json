    "body": "Sean Martin, Senior Guides Writer (Image credit: Future) Last week I was: enjoying my break, battling to become king in Metaphor: ReFantazio This week I've been: bum-rushing Stella Montis to try and get the new Expedition resources I've bounced back and forth on Arc Raiders' Expedition mechanic. At first, I thought it wasn't worth the investment , back before Embark revealed all the details about what we were getting, but once it announced the $5 million for five skill points and the unique skin, I came around to the idea of Presitiging despite a lot of community grumbling . Embark definitely should've announced the details sooner, but at least we all know in advance this season, so it's easier to grind that five mil if you feel inclined. Like many, I didn't have enough cash or time to get all five skill points (I only got three), but I wanted to experience the Expedition first hand. So I packed off my Raider, retired them to a nice farm upstate, and definitely didn't feel bad about effectively sending them to the glue factory for some tasty benefits. Even when I finished the Expedition, I wasn't sure if it was ultimately going to be worth it. The unique skin seemed nice and all ,…",

The game's lead game designer Michel Nohra confesses that they might've gone a little astray, there, per an interview with Edge magazine for Issue 419 (thanks, Gamesradar ): \"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now.\" See, while it's a safe assumption that Clair Obscur lets you keep playing after the credits roll, it's also a safe assumption that you're meant to do a little exploring first—more than that, Nohra explains, most players keep the final boss as a motivating carrot on the end of a stick: \"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content.

And for CES 2026, it's just announced the Aura Nebula earbuds , which look like they might offer a good balance between audiophile quality and gamer-oriented features and pricing. The earbuds feature a \"breakthrough hybrid five-driver acoustic system paired with a sophisticated three-way electronic crossover.\" That crossover refers to a 10 mm dynamic driver, a 6 mm planar driver, dual balanced armatures, and a \"micro-planar tweeter.\" Presumably the whole \"three-way\" thing is excluding the latter tweeter, as that's just more planar gubbins. So, there's a mix of dynamic, planar, and dual balanced armatures here. We've seen plenty of triple-driver earbuds before, but not so many that are specifically mixing planar with dynamic. This combination is probably what helps the price stay so \"low\", as these are \"set to launch this Spring at $200.\" That's expensive, of course, but it's hardly the, err, $1,300 of the fully Planar Audeze Euclid .

McAfee said that AMD is \"certainly looking at everything that [it] can do to bring more supply and kind of reintroduce products back into the ecosystem to satisfy the demands of gamers that maybe want that significant upgrade in their AM4 platform without having to rebuild their entire system.\" He's also cited as saying it's something AMD is \"very actively working on.\" The AM4 socket that is used by older processors, such as the Ryzen 5000 series, supports DDR4 memory.

The members in question included Tom's Hardware , which reported on the Q&A session, and it was AMD's president of GPU Technologies and Chief Software Officer, Andrej Zdravković, who provided the pertinent answers. Tom's writes that, \"The software head responded that the accidental public release in August was unexpected, but that it intends to release the source for the FSR4 library while keeping the core technology closed, so as not to give Nvidia engineers an advantage.\" Technically, that's already happened, as back in August 2025, somebody at AMD accidentally uploaded source code for the FidelityFX SDK to GitHub , before swiftly removing it.

Which is a very good thing, as the original Maxwell headset is outstanding, and there's been nothing to beat it as the best for gaming audiophiles since it launched two years ago. Meet Maxwell 2 — elevate your game with industry-leading audio, upgraded ergonomics, and AI-powered microphones. Shipping now. pic.twitter.com/Cfe5f1pWSb January 5, 2026 The Maxwell 2 sports the same 90 mm planar magnetic transducers (aka drivers), Fluxor array of magnets, and Fazor audio phase management system.

Peppered with bullet holes? Enjoy a crisp 10 frames-a-second, no matter your monitor and GPU. Which is all quite amusing, I reckon, but I think the part that most piques my interest is the game's upgrade system. There are new guns that do more damage and churn out more shots per second, sure, but it looks like the meat of the game's upgrades revolve around finding new and exciting ways to break the whole thing. Want more frames, and thereby more health? Try swapping out your 3D-modelled gun for a 2D sprite, try hacking apart the level geometry, try futzing with the whole thing so much you eventually break the game. It genuinely seems quite clever.

It's called SmartPowerHDR. It works by analysing each frame's peak brightness in real-time, sending that data to the panel's Timing Controller (TCON), which then optimises the voltage sent to the panel based on how many pixels are active on-screen. More or less, it's adapting the voltage depending on what the screen displays. Today's HDR modes apply a fixed voltage. \"Traditional HDR modes remain locked at maximum brightness, resulting in excessive power usage even in standard scenarios,\" the press release reads. \"As a result, many laptops default to SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) mode despite the color and brightness advantages of HDR.\" The benefit, as reported by the two companies, is around a 22% power saving in general usage with SmartPowerHDR, or around a 17% reduction during HDR content. True HDR content is going to request a higher voltage more often, such as a game with HDR support. Whereas things like web browsing, finding files or typing in documents don't really need …",

Don't get me wrong, the mosaic mirrored panels are very snazzy but perhaps a little too attention-grabbing for any room I could realistically picture it in.

Buckle up, because the InWin Aeon PC case possesses one of the most extra opening mechanisms I've yet seen . First, you need to trigger the opening mechanism by swiping an RFID card across the PC case's base. Then, the case's back opens and is gently lowered to lie flat via a hydraulic mechanism. This is meant to afford easy hardware installation but it's a whole lot of fanfare just to open your PC case—Not to mention additional potential points of failure.

It's only a concept, so there's no actual product to get your mitts on, but as far as concept products go, I actually quite like this one. I love narrower 14-inch and 16-inch form factors for portability, and the aspect ratio is great for work and general use, but for gaming I prefer a standard 16:9 ratio. Not only does it feel more immersive, but because of the way they're designed, many games will actually cut off a little of your field of view when you chop off some real estate. That latter point isn't a major issue unles…",

Not only are you practically under the control of the weather, but there's never any guarantee that you'll see anything good. That's why in the bleak midwinter when the last thing I want to do is go outside, I look for games like the demo of Flock Around which let me birdwatch without feeling the bitter cold. Plus, you are almost guaranteed to see a cool bird, which is always a nice plus. You take on the role of what is essentially a sentient, cylindrical blob who has been trusted with a camera and unleashed in a park. You can customise the colour, eyes, mouth, and clothing, but aside from that, there's not much going for you. That doesn't matter though, as you've got one job and one job only: take cool photos of the local wildlife. The demo gives you a guidebook with 20 birds to track down and photograph within, but with no clues or hints as to what to look for and what they sound like, so you best believe it's just a lot of point and click pictures and hoping for the best.

AMD's Dr. Lisa Su, pretty much the same. AI Gigafactorys were revealed . An oddly-named AI assistant was given its first outing. But for us PC gamers, we mostly had to make do with a brief mention of... this FIFA-themed Lenovo Legion Pro 7i . Hey, I get it. AI is a big deal these days, and not every event needs to cater to those of us that prefer to use our machines primarily as gaming devices. Still, it'd be nice to get something more than what appears to be a pre-existing gaming laptop with a sports theme, but I'll work with what we've got.

Instead, they're in malfunctioning T-45 power armor (thanks, Bud), fighting on the Alaskan Front with sparks shooting out of their limbs. Coop radios in to complain about their armor and request a return to base. When that's denied he creatively reinterprets his orders to send Charlie back, promising he'll be right behind. As soon as he's alone though, Coop hears mysterious growling coming from the other side of some mysterious wreckage. We're finally going to see a living deathclaw. Walton Goggins spends a lot of time as Coop reacting to things that are shocking and it's a credit to his acting that, even after so many episodes of seeing him be surprised by awful stuff, he really sells the deathclaw as uniquely scary.

Well, I've had a chance to check out Nvidia's new G-Sync Pulsar tech in action at CES 2026 , and now I'm afraid that all other gaming monitors look a bit... crap. It's Medusa-like tech. I've seen it, I can't unsee it, and now I'm forever changed. Okay, that's a hefty dose of overstatement. But Pulsar's refresh rate-matched backlight strobing tech makes such a difference to the way your eye perceives moving objects on a screen, looking at a regular monitor in motion now feels like a lesser experience. I was shown two demos, the first of which involved NPC characters with nametags moving quickly past my field of view in Overwatch 2 . On the left was a monitor without G-Sync Pulsar, and it looked fine. A little hard to read at full speed, but hey, motion blur is motion blur, and the fast-moving characters looked completely normal to my eyes. On the right was a Pulsar-enabled monitor.

(Sony applied for the patent in 2023; these things take time.) The patent proposes an in-game interface that accepts \"natural language queries\" to identify which bit of the game you're stuck on, and then can either show you how to overcome the obstacle or take over and do it for you. I guess via possession? The \"ghost character\" who provides \"ghost assistance\" will be based on footage of other players, presumably scraped from YouTube by AI. There's already a Game Help feature on Playstation 5 that can bring up relevant videos when you're stuck, and this seems like a less jarring implementation of that. As far as throwing AI at videogames goes, it sounds pretty inoffensive to me. It's not costing anyone their job or, you know, devaluing the connection between artist and audience. If it means there's one less reason to splatter yellow paint telling us where to go all over videogames, this seems like a good thing. Of course, that's not how gamers have responded.

Launched at CES, this is actually Lenovo's second device to natively use SteamOS. The first was the superb Legion Go S , which just so happens to be the best handheld gaming PC you can buy right now. That said, the hardware inside is somewhat last-gen, and that's something the Legion Go 2 offers over the Go S. The newer model sports an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme , whereas the older device gets by with a Z1 Extreme. These are APUs—a single chip comprising a CPU and GPU—and while they both house eight processor cores (supporting 16 threads), the Z2 Extreme uses AMD's Zen 5 and 5c architectures (three of the former, five of the latter). However, handheld devices are rarely held back by their CPUs, as games are far more GPU-limited than anything else. That's another area where the Z2 Extreme edges over the Z1 Extreme: its GPU has 16 RDNA 3.5 compute units (CUs), whereas the older chip has 12 RDNA 3 CUs. …",

It's a respectable list, with a few familiar names both among the actors and the characters they'll be playing. Zip, Lara's tech guy introduced in Tomb Raider: Chronicles, will be played by Martin Bobb-Semple; Winston, the Croft family's long-suffering butler, will be played by Bill Paterson; Atlas de Mornay, Lara's uncle, will be played by Jason Isaacs. Having Uncle Atlas be played by the actor most famous as Lucius Malfoy in Harry Potter—though he deserves to be just as well-known for playing Field Marshal Zhukov in The Death of Stalin and Enver Gortash in Baldur's Gate 3—suggests he might turn out to not be a supportive family member.

Arc Raiders was planned as a free-to-play game for the majority of its lengthy development, but in late 2024, Embark pivoted to a traditional paid model . In a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi , Embark founder Patrick Söderlund reflected on the decision, and said it was easier to cut against the grain of free-to-play after witnessing the success of other premium multiplayer games like Helldivers 2. \"It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like Helldivers and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'\" Söderlund said. \"We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue.

Fallout 4, Fallout: New Vegas, and even Fallout 3 and the original Fallouts have essentially doubled their daily concurrent players on Steam since Fallout Season 2 started airing on Prime Video in December. Via SteamDB , we can see that in the weeks leading up to the show's premiere in mid-December, Fallout 4 was typically averaging about 20,000 concurrent players, but as of Sunday that count had risen to over 40,000. Likewise, Fallout: New Vegas was pulling in roughly 8,000 concurrents a day, and that rose to nearly 20,000 last weekend. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Even Fallout 3, which was typically attracting a mere hundred or so concurrent players on Steam on an average day, has risen to close to 200—not exactly a towering number, but still about double what it was before Fallout Season 2 started.

Basically, you can think of it as a great big step up from the Phison E31T, which features in our current budget favourite for the best PCIe 5.0 SSD for gaming , the Crucial P510 NVMe SSD . To make that short story a little longer, I'll borrow some of Phison's own words; the company touts the new E37T memory controller's ability \"to deliver competitive price-to-performance value for modern consumer workloads across notebooks and mobile devices.\" To cut through the marketing-speak, this memory controller should make PCIe 5.0 drives not only faster but just a little more affordable, too.

Well, chalk up another win for the Dootster.

Combine that with his previous no-hit wins in Dark Souls 2 and 3 (and Elden Ring, by the by) and you've got the full combo: a hitless, sax-based run of the entire Souls trilogy, a feat presumably unparalleled through all human history. To be fair, Gwyn went down like a chump. Dr Doot was using a sorcery build that made total mincemeat of the old guy. Rather than a nailbiter finish, it was more of a one-punch (one-doot) man situation. Still, our hero was rightly pleased with his achievement. \"The World's First Sax-Controlled Dark Souls No-Hit Run has been DOOTED!\" wrote Dr Doot in a post on X. \"I just beat Dark Souls without getting hit by a single ene…",

Last year, Intel unveiled a reference semi-modular design in its blog, and this Schenker design is the first to roll out a finished product with it. The Schenker Element 16, which is reportedly launching in Spring 2026, has an Intel Core Ultra Series 3, with support for up to 64 GB of memory. We don't yet know what the price point is or when orders will open up. As displayed on the Bestware website , there's a small latch on the bottom of the laptop, which can be flicked to get access to the internals. From there, you can take off and replace the keyboard, swap out the storage and memory, replace the battery and fans, and you can even customise the ports on the sides of the device. Wccftech says that future motherboard upgrades are planned, meaning you can swap the Series 3 chip out for something else, if available. The fact that this is based on an Intel design, however, does suggest you will only be upgrading to future Intel chips. Imag…",

Primarily, these rumblings have come from AMD's CES 2026 keynote , but there's also a glimmer of hope granted by Nvidia, too. On the former front, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su actually spent a fair amount of time talking about local AI. Admittedly, much of this was in the form of bigging up the company's new mobile chips, the Ryzen AI 400-series , which is essentially the Strix Point 300-series with some clock speed bumps. But that's to be expected, and hardly goes against my point: these companies still want people to be using devices—preferably ones with their silicon—and if AI is all the rage, local AI on devices is a big selling point.
