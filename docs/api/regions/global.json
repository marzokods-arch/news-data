The game's Steam reviews have been absolutely tanking and the reason will surprise no-one who's played it: performance. I'm a Monster Hunter megafan and, when it released, Wilds ran so poorly for those opening weeks that it pretty much put me off. The crossover update launched on September 29, 2025, and since then there have been just over 5,000 reviews posted, with just under 80% of those negative. The Steam reviews make for some grim reading , and what's especially notable is how many of them begin by talking about the reviewer's love for the Monster Hunter series, with the obvious comparison point of MH: World frequently used. The game's overall reviews are just about treading water at \"Mixed\" but those 5,000 \"mostly negative\" recent reviews are taking a toll. . \"The game is fun but completely overshadowed by the technical issues, which have been here since day one,\" says Sol FamilyGuy. That points to another refrain, which is that players are exasperated that the technical issues in Wilds have persisted for so…",

It is actually a cool feature, but the duration needs to be longer,\" player Mr-Too-Cool says . \"If they are unwilling to do that, then remove it entirely. Adding a one-second duration to it would be an easy fix a dev can do in less than an hour.\" I will die on this hill, this feature needs to be altered or removed entirely. from r/Battlefield6 I never like to impose timeframes on fixes or changes, as I personally have no idea how long it would take for a dev to actually do this and have even less of a clue as to what repercussions there'd be after just jumping in to change one thing in a speedy manner.

Exactly how many GPUs AMD will sell to OpenAI isn't clear, but the announcement says that if the arrangement comes fully to fruition, OpenAI will be running fully 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Intriguingly, the deal also includes OpenAI taking an up to 10% equity stake in AMD. The first 1 gigawatt tranche kicks off in the second half of next year based on AMD's next-gen Instinct MI450 AI GPU. At the same time, OpenAI will acquire the first segment of up to 160 million AMD shares. If the deal progresses right through to the final 6 gigawatt GPU power figure, OpenAI will by then have bought 160 million AMD shares accounting for roughly 10% of the company. At current values, that would be a $26 billion investment. So, it's a megabucks deal all round. It also the first really big AI GPU win of this kind for AMD, at least that we are aware of. It looks like it's big news too for the markets, as AMD's share price rocketed up 35% on the news during early trading . Kerching!

I can't claim all the credit; the Asus ProArt PA401 is a gem. The wood finish down the front panels, the all-black interior, and the clever switches that make it a breeze are all to thank for that. Now I do realise the irony of saying less is more and placing two sticks of G.Skill's finest gold-plated, faux-crystal RAM sticks in there, but they don't look anything near as garish as they sound. This is an all-AMD gaming PC; my slight obsession with using the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in full force here. It's a powerful gaming chip for a reasonable price—3D V-Cache working a treat for improving frame rates. If you wanted to improve further, you could opt for the 16 cores of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D , but you'll pay a tall fee for that. No, the 9800X3D works great here, and most of all in combination with the Asus Prime 9070 XT I've selected to go with it. Get the build: $2,168 | £2,018 Chassis Asus ProArt Case PA401 Woo…",

But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems, helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat. Those who did manage to slip through didn’t last long.

Battlefield 6 also requires secure boot, much to the chagrin of Linux gamers everywhere. In fairness, gamers are reasonably concerned about giving a company kernel-level access to their machines, which, as our own hardware writer Jacob Ridley put it , \"is like administrator [mode] on steroids\". It also shuts out people without TPM on their processors (hence the aforementioned Linux upset). The \"automated systems\" are referring to Ricochet, an anti-cheat system that uses AI—if these nu…",

Unfortunately, it's pretty hard to enjoy the game for yourself, as Petscop went unreleased, unfinished, and largely exists today as one of the more mysterious creepypastas floating around strange corners of the internet. For all its weirdness, it's a game I wish I could've experienced firsthand with zero warning. (Image credit: AndyLand) In steps Endacopia. Apart from being a point-and-click horror game, I don't really understand what's going on in Endacopia most of the time, which is entirely the point and why it feels so close to a Petscop spiritual successor.

I've no idea what the TTRPG of Vampire is like to actually play, but I admit I loved the lore, which got ever more absurd with every new sourcebook. Now, you too can experience this unparalleled joy: the latest Humble book bundle is a collection of 54 World of Darkness ebooks (in PDF form) spanning the Vampire, Werewolf, and Hunter series. Mathematics tells us that's quite a lot of books, but economics tells us that, fair play, they're not all that expensive. The entire 57-item bundle (that's the 54 books plus three sets of bonus materials) will set you back $25 (£18.54) . You can nab a cheaper 27-item bundle—which nixes the core rulebooks and several of the newer sourcebooks—is $15 (£11.12) .

    "body": "Intel's woes the last decade or so are well-enough documented. So, it's not a huge surprise to find a former senior Intel manager describing morale as being \"in the toilet.\" But it hits hard, all the same. A new feature on Fortune.com outlines Intel's current problems and provides a glimpse of the huge effort it's going to take to truly turn things around. Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges involves staff, both inside and outside the company. On the one hand, staff inside Intel are said to be demoralised. It's a, “heads-down, push-through situation. That spark in people’s eyes, the desire to do this work, was not there,” said the same former Intel insider of the company's recent predicament. At the same time, attracting new talent to what's seen as a sinking ship is going to be extremely difficult. Intel is no longer the top destination for the \"brightest minds\" in engineering. \"Most people want to be part of a growth story, not a turnaround story,\" another former senior Intel manager is quoted as saying. Fortune notes that Intel's latest CEO Lip Bu Tan has touted new engineering hires as evidence of the progress being made. But that reportedly hasn't landed well inside …",

Or punishment cutscene, depending on how you feel about the whole thing. As showcased by YouTuber Cuttyflame , successfully skipping \"around 30\" or so of the game's cutscenes—harder than it sounds: skipping cutscenes requires passing an ever-more-complex series of minigames—will eventually lead protagonist Nate to straightforwardly give up on trying to act out cutscenes towards the game's end. Rather than, you know, do a proper cutscene, Nate and chill donkey-guy Moose will acknowledge the player's lack of interest in their narrative, sit down, drop character, and embark on a cutscene that puts even Kojima to shame.

Even when I know there's a shipwreck or temple, I will simply not go on the expedition. Minecraft's next drop, Mounts of Mayhem , provides a failsafe way to explore the ocean however, and I'm not sure I can get away with this anymore. Rather than having to rely on potions and your own ability to swim, the Nautilus will make the process of navigating the waves so much easier. These underwater mobs can be tamed with pufferfish before being saddled up and ridden by the player.

For context: In the Borderlands 4 post-game, there's a vendor called Maurice's Black Market , a vending machine that changes location every week and sells a number of legendaries that are rolled on a per-player basis. However, a recent patch introduced a bug that meant players in co-op games couldn't interact with the Maurice machines in their friends' worlds. It's a so-so system—it can be disappointing to rush to your own personal Maurice box, only to find out that none of the rolls are useful—but Pitchford does make a solid argument that this system lets communities band together to share their rolls and pick a buddy to skim good legendary weapons off.

Are SSD and system memory prices poised to go the same way? According to analysis by Tom's Hardware , the unfortunate answer is yes. Tom's claims that, \"nearly every analyst firm and memory maker is now warning of looming NAND and DRAM shortages that will send SSD and memory prices skyrocketing over the coming months and years, with some even predicting a shortage that will last a decade.\" The reason, inevitably, is explosive demand for AI hardware. Tom's notes that there's some of the usual cyclical variation going on here. Following a downturn in demand in 2022 and 2023 that saw DRAM and NAND memory manufacturers selling chips below cost, manufacturing volumes were scaled back, which eventually fed through into higher prices. But more recently, the insatiable demands of AI for training and inference is requiring vast amounts of storage and memory. One AI outfit alone, OpenAI, has signed a deal with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which could account for 40% of current global DRAM output . Meanwhile,…",

    "body": "For the first time since switching to an annual expansion cycle, Guild Wars 2's next release will introduce a new set of elite specializations for each of the game's nine classes—or professions, as they're called in-game. Elite specs are a pretty big deal—making fundamental changes to how a profession plays. New traits, utility skills and an overhaul of the base profession mechanic means entire new builds for players to try. \"We definitely figured out that we wanted to do elite specs pretty early,\" says Cal Cohen, senior game designer for Guild Wars 2, in an interview with PC Gamer. Previous annual expansions have focused on adding new weapon options for each profession, which Cohen notes are \"a lot more specific\" in what they can do for a profession's kit. New elite specs, meanwhile, give ArenaNet a lot more options in what they can pursue. \"When we look at elite specializations, we really try to shift the profession mechanic into something more radical … so that the gameplay is significantly changed. And usually elite specs can also fill a couple of different roles. So whenever we can do elite specs, I think we want to do elite specs.\" The new set of elite specs, which are launc…",

Every other week, I'll be sharing my thoughts on the genre, interviewing fellow MMO-heads like me, taking a deep-dive into mechanics we've all taken for granted, and, occasionally, bringing in guest writers to talk about their MMO of choice. My credentials? Well, I've had the fortune—or misfortune, if you will—to've been playing MMOs for most of my life, and I will be playing them until they no longer exist or until I am dead. In other words? I'm Terminally Online. I've noticed a recent trend—I say recent, more a slow slide taking place over the past decade—of MMORPGs doing away with the casual/hardcore split. See, in the olden days, there were the tryhards and the try-nots. The elite and the n00bs. The sweats and the… dry people. I'm not sure what the opposite of a sweat is. MMOs have classically been large, open worlds that you could futz around forever in. But if you wanted to see every inch of them, you had to work. Reputation grinds, gruelling gear requirements, punishing death mechanics, and the biggest challenge of all: Getting 40 people to agree to show up to something. A \"hardcore\" player lies…",

When Phil Iwaniuk reviewed Millennia he called it \"rough-edged but worthwhile\", with complaints about its UI and AI and few other things, but praise for its way of handling progress through the ages and \"city improvement tile system.\" It sounded like the kind of game that could be significantly improved by a few additions, and while it did receive several—the final patch is update eight—it doesn't seem like enough was done to elevate it above the competition. \"With this patch,\" the announcement says, \"we are sadly coming to the end of an age. This will be the final patch for Millennia, thanks to C Prompt for their work and support of this game. We at Paradox will no longer be active on community platforms for Millennia, but you can continue counting on us for support needs, and the game will remain available to play indefinitely.\" That announcement highlights …",

Perhaps that's true when you need a game to sell in the tens of millions, but within the same period of time that both Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth have failed to meet the company's lofty expectations, turn-based RPGs in general have been on such a hot streak that they're making their action contemporaries look dusty by comparison. While in Tokyo last week for TGS I played three turn-based RPGs, and I only realized in hindsight that the genre unintentionally represented most of the demo time I was able to squeeze in when not filming interviews for the PC Gaming Show . All three were fun, completely different, and embody the hot streak that turn-based RPGs have been on for at least the last year. I'm specifically thinking of more Japanese-style RPGs, here, though of course if we jump back to 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 turn-based games don't need much defending. But after all the talk back then about BG3 raising the bar for RPGs as a whole, I've been delighted this year to see …",

Enjoy Cronos on Steam, wherever you are!\" Cronos: The New Dawn was already Deck Verified at launch, but now Steam Deck and Linux players won't have to run the game through a compatibility layer. More and more games are getting native Linux support, largely due to the popularity of the Steam Deck. For instance, Hollow Knight: Silksong had native Linux support at launch last month, while one hero engineer at Larian delivered us a native version of Baldur's Gate 3 . Cronos: The New Dawn joins a growing list of over 42,000 games on Steam with Linux support. At the time of writing, over 9,000 games are Deck Verified. Currently six out of the top ten games on Steam's U.S. Top Sellers list (not including the Steam Deck itself) are either \"Playable\" or \"Verified\" on Steam Deck. Only two have native Linux support, but that's better than none. The September Steam Hardware Survey puts Linux usage at 2.68%, up from 1.92% in September 2…",

I resent having enough of an internet poisoned brain to parse that statement, and wanted to know more. For any normal people with healthy relationships reading this, \"gamer word\" is a sarcastic turn of phrase that emerged out of the fracas of influencer PewDiePie's use of a racial slur in a 2017 PUBG Twitch stream, infamously excused by one defender as a \"heated gaming moment.\" Valve added four new maps to Counter-Strike 2 in an update published October 1 : Transit, Golden, Palacio, and Rooftop. These were community maps made official and put into Counter-Strike 2's rotation by Valve. Two days later on October 3, Valve put out a laconic update with just three changes, one of which was \"Removed Transit from official matchmaking.\" Absent explanation from Valve, we can only speculate, but the most likely culprit is the entity name (how an in-game o…",

Since then I've come to the conclusion that everyone is secretly a JRPG fan—it's just about finding the right one at the right time in your life. Over the subsequent years I played all four of the Trails of Cold Steel PC ports as they were released, but it always rankled with me that if I wanted to go back to the start of the series (five games earlier) and experience the story from the beginning, I'd have to play a 21-year-old game. There is a 2014 PC port of the original Trails in the Sky , but I'd be losing out on all the combat features added over the years, a whole heap of QoL, and would have to deal with the perspective shift from full 3D to that classic chibi-sprite isometric look that older JRPGs favour.

One scripted, one very-much-not, but two watershed moments in open-world games this decade. Now, as we slouch slowly but surely towards GTA 6 (on console, at least; a PC launch date still lingers in the ether) and the promise of whatever shape its own online offshoot might take, the idea of balancing the invented with the inadvertent excites me to no end. With that in mind, low-key Rockstar partnerships dance at the forefront of my imagination. Wheels of steel (Image credit: Rockstar/Traderrjoe) You see, no matter how well-executed Rockstar's blockbuster GTA Online updates have been in more recent years, there's something brilliant about its most unhinged but unplanned moments on the streets of San Andreas.

But unlike your usual old-school music discovery methods—the radio, bargain bin CDs, listening to your pal's MP3 player—the way I stumbled across what is now one of my favourite bands is a little strange. I actually first heard Hayley Williams warbling in The Sims' nonsense language, Simlish. It first made an appearance in the console version of The Sims 2, and I was hooked from the very first radio play. It took me some time to realise that Pressure and Paramore was a real song performed by a real artist—listen, I was a child, and a bit of a stupid one at that—but Simlish renditions of real-world songs have since become an integral part of The Sims experience. Sure, you could probably just add the songs in English and be done with it, but The Sims intentionally avoided using real languages in the game for a reason. S…",

Alongside the bosses, the stony shores are prowled by new Ichthian creatures to fight, such as the Ketos Spawn and \"shark-like Bruisers\" led by powerful commanders.

    "body": "It isn't unusual for a game to go quiet after a popular early access launch, but Manor Lords has been quieter than most. Slavic Magic's medieval city-builder was the most exciting thing to happen in April 2024, a quietly enthralling simulation of everyday life in the Middle Ages that somehow achieved cultural critical mass, becoming Steam's most wishlisted game and selling 3 million copies in its first year of early access. Yet while updates remained relatively consistent through last year, 2025 has been much more sporadic, with no updates in the last nine months. That's changed now, however, as Slavic Magic has finally released a new experimental beta for Manor Lords, one that brings an impressive array of new features to the city-builder. The beta patch expands the scope of Manor Lords in several directions. It adds four new maps that can be played in two additional game modes—1v1 Duel and a four-way free-for-all called Fractured Realm. It also adds a new masonry-themed production chain that lets players fashion stone and mortar through building a quarry, stonemason and lime kiln. Meanwhile, many existing mechanics and ideas have been expanded or reworked. Castle-building is mor…",

Sure, it would have sold far fewer copies with such a title, but at least it would have been correct . Now, though, it won't be long until 3D Realms' 1996 shooter fully embraces length, breadth and depth, thanks to one intrepid modder utterly obsessed with voxels. Said modder is Dan Peterson , who goes by the monicker Cheello, a game developer specialising in voxel tech who spends his spare time bulking out classic 90s shooters using the pixel's three-dimensional equivalent. Peterson's first project was Blood: Coagulated , which replaces the enemies and objects of Monolith's 1997 shooter with fatter, voxel-based versions. But Peterson is best known for his 2022 mod Voxel Doom , which brought us chunky pinkies, beefier hellknights, and truly round Cacodemons. Now, Peterson has revealed Voxel Duke Nukem 3D, debuting the project in a trailer on YouTube. \"All monsters, babes, props and more have been fully converted to 3D voxel models.\" Peterson writes in the trailer description. \"Blast your way th…",

Roblox did not give a firm list of these \"sensitive issues,\" saying vaguely that they include \"any current sensitive social, political, or religious issue\" with \"polarized viewpoints\" or a potential to trigger a \"strong emotional response.\" The announcement on the new policy gave some examples, stating that \"issues such as immigration, capital punishment, gun control, marriage equality, pay equity in sports, prayer in schools, racial profiling, affirmative action, vaccination policies, and reproductive righ…",

What is clear is that GameStop is listening to the complaints about the price hike. In contrast, Microsoft is reportedly attempting to smooth things over by considering a free, ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming .

I am of course referring to the other Wheel of Time , the first-person spell-slinger developed by Legend Entertainment and released in 1999. The Wheel of Time was praised by critics when it launched, partly due to its association with the popular series of fantasy novels, but equally due to its decent singleplayer campaign and innovative multiplayer mode.

Instead, we were eating the seed corn and they were taking all the money.\" West and Zampella sued Activision for wrongful termination; Activision countersued, alleging the pair were \"small-minded executives\" motivated by \"envy and personal greed\". (Image credit: Activision) Ultimately, the publisher settled with West and Zampella ahead of a trial. But the damage was done. Many of Infinity Ward's veterans had followed their bosses to Respawn, a new EA-funded outfit that would go on to make Titanfall, Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
