Alas, it's just been delayed by a month, mere hours before its scheduled November 6 release date. According to RJ Lake at studio D-Cell Games, the delay is unavoidable. \"There’s a very boring and frustrating reason,\" Lake wrote on Steam . \"QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and not fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it.\" In other words, a rare progress-blocking bug was discovered at the eleventh hour and, because pushing updates to console platforms is much more time-consuming than it is on Steam, the studio and its publisher Playstack have decided to push the whole affair back by a month. Unbeatable will now release on December 9. That is over a month from the game's expected launch, which is probably frustrating for anyone looking f…",

And now Ball x Pit is slightly better because the November patch fixes a bunch of bugs, and as the top patch note explains, the encyclopedia has been updated with full-color icons. This may seem like a small thing, but the original version not only looked bland, but made it tough to tell at a glance whether you were looking at, say, a poison ball or an ice ball. Now that one is green and the other blue like God intended that's no longer an issue. (It was enough of an annoyance there was even a now-redundant Encyclopedia Colored mod .) The update also changes the way the retry option works: \"Retry no longer causes resources gained in previous run to be lost\".

Rockstar and parent company Take-Two did not immediately explain the cause of the firings after the news broke last week , initially saying only that the employees were guilty of \"gross misconduct.\" In a statement sent to Bloomberg this week, the developer elaborated, saying that the workers had been \"distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum\" and that the firings were \"in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities.\" The IWGB, however, says that the only Rockstar outsiders the employees were speaking to were labor organizers.

Jennifer Hale, the voice actor playing Jedi Master Bastila Shan in Knights of the Old Republic, did not know the twist in advance. As is often the case in videogame recording, she didn't get to see the script until she was in the booth. \"We never got our scripts ahead of time\", Hale recently told Buzzfeed . \"Most of the games I've ever done have been cold reading.

Microsoft's Chris Capossela was in the middle of demonstrating a novel feature—plug-and-play USB support—by hooking up a scanner, prompting Windows 98 to download its drivers. Then, wham: Blue Screen of Death. Gates takes it in stride, quipping \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet,\" but I always figured somebody got chewed out for the crash afterward.

Are we $20 lawn guys?\" The idea that you can put the word \"simulator\" after any job or mundane activity and make a videogame out of it used to be a joke at the expense of series like Farming Simulator, but it's no joke anymore. A cottage industry has grown around simulating every job and activity it's possible to simulate: hairdressing, gold mining, home renovating, power washing, you name it. And inevitably, the people who actually do these jobs show up in the Steam user reviews to tell us how well the game matches reality, which is how I learned recently that firefighters do not, in fact, use the \"fireman's carry\" where you sling someone over your shoulders.

My friend make a post on steam about disabling crossplay on PC and here is a result from r/Battlefield6 This is notable, because while the console versions of Battlefield 6 lets players toggle crossplay on or off, the PC version—so I'm told, I can't run it myself so I can't check—cannot.

Serious fans were unhappy, though, for a number of reasons, foremost among them the music. Music in the original Plants vs. Zombies is dynamic, you see, changing with the events on the screen, but for some reason EA did away with that in the remaster—instead, it only played the \"high intensity\" version of the soundtrack. It sounds like a minor thing (even at its most intense, PvZ music is pretty not intense ) but holy cow, did people notice—including composer Laura Shigihara—and they did not care for it .

PC Gamer has verified that these text strings exist in the Discord API under the name \"MR test\" and will be giftable to other users just like profile decorations. While you can't actually buy any of them yet, each entry includes prices in USD that roughly match the amount of premium currency they're available for in the game. The Jeff the Land Shark's Halloween skin, for example, is listed for $20.49 and is about $22 worth of premium currency in-game. RivalsInfo says buying the skins will grant them to the Marvel Rivals account you have linked to your Discord. And that right there sounds like the kind of thing Discord would do now that it's pushing game developers to integrate its SDK for things like friend…",

Since sometimes there's not universal agreement on how a game's name is punctuated across different sites (such as Steam and Wikipedia), I've gone to the publisher's website (when possible) for the definitive answer.

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers.

Specifically, that's the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, the only version of AMD's Strix Halo mobile APU that's available with all 40 RDNA 3.5-spec graphics compute units available. And it's those 40 CUs, plus Strix Halo's exceptionally wide (for an APU) 256-bit bus, that make it so appealing, on paper, for gaming.

But that has a downsized GPU with 32 CUs, significantly lessening the appeal of the device. Anyway, the \"base\" model with the top-tier 395 APU kicks off with a hefty 48 GB of memory. If that sounds like overkill, especially for a handheld, remember it's shared between the CPU and GPU. You also get a 1 TB SSD. The OneXFly Apex can be optioned up to 128 GB of memory and a 2 TB SSD.

This issue has only gotten worse since the release of Redsec, where meeting some of these challenge requirements is even harder in the free-to-play. Thankfully, our collective frustration is over, as Battlefield Studios takes its first pass at improving specific assignment challenges, explaining that the goal is to \"[cut] down on time investment while maintaining a focus on skill-driven progression\". All in all, there's \"a total of 90+ adjustments\" across class, weapon, mode, unit, and gameplay assignments in this update, and it's just the first of many: \"the scale of our plans for Challenges and Assignments are large and will take place over multiple server-side and client-side updates, expect additional updates in the future.\" These changes are already live in-game, and any progress you've already made will automatically apply to the new criteria.

The lure of doing something perfectly normal on terra firma in the utterly hostile environment of space is just the preserve of a handful of coders, though, as two companies are hoping to be the first to have a data center and, believe it or not, a chip foundry in orbit. This might seem like a colossally expensive thing to do, but when one of the aforementioned companies just happens to be Google, you know that the upfront cost probably isn't an issue. With the name Project Suncatcher , you'd be forgiven for thinking that Google is hoping to design a special solar panel system to power all of its data centers. Well, that's partially correct, but Project Suncatcher aims to use the power of the Sun by getting just a teeny bit closer to it, by putting the data centers in space. This isn't some whimsical fantasy; Google has seriously thought about all of this, as detailed in its research paper (PDF warning) on the project. The reason behind it all is that if you have satellites in a synchronous low Earth orbit, they're exposed almost continuously to sun…",

Hence why CS2 lets players review their performance via demo playbacks. Yet because of the way the Internet works, what players see in a demo playback may not reflect the game they experienced with complete accuracy. As of Counter-Strike 2's latest update, however, players should find playbacks better representative of live matches. This is thanks to a new feature Valve introduced to the demo system named TrueView. \"With TrueView, demo playback will match the player's original experience much more closely,\" Valve writes in a Steam post . \"Previously demo playback showed the server's view of the world, without accounting for network latency. This could be confusing because shots would hit that didn't look like they should have, and vice versa.\" (Image credit: Valve) As Valve explains, TrueView attempts to solve this issue by re-running the client-side prediction.

To get the good news out of the way, lots of the best skills in the Mobility tree are right at the start, like Marathon Runner and Youthful Lungs. These are incredibly helpful upgrades that don't require all that much investment. My advice is to pick these up and then move on to the Survival tree to pick up the likes of Looter's Instincts, Broad…",

And while part of that's true, the recent spate of MMO news has me wondering if it's entirely our fault no new MMOs are coming out. Corporate wisdom (which is oftentimes an oxymoron) would have you believe that live services are the new moneymaker ( sure, if you hit it big , if you don't, you die) and that MMOs are unsustainable. To be fair to that wisdom, there are nuggets of truth in it. I don't mean to say that MMOs are a sure bet, far from it. MMOs are expensive, require constant maintenance, and competition is fierce because we don't like trying new stuff. But also, Amazon kinda messed New World up, and its shutdown is more about mismanagement than anything else. Contrary to hindsight, New World is not, on paper, a failed MMO.

It seems the variant we always wanted to see, which majors in graphics rather than CPU grunt, is set to be released. Chinese PC specialist SixUnited has a couple of new Ryzen AI Max models listed on its website (via Videocardz ), and indeed, a SixUnited tablet running one of the \"new\" APUs has popped up in the PassMark database . The most exciting model is the Ryzen AI Max+ 388. That combines eight CPU cores with the maximum 40 graphics compute unit count available from Strix Halo. Currently, the only way to get a version of Strix Halo with all 40 RDNA 3.5c CUs is to go with the very top Ryzen AI Max+ 395 model. That's a very expensive APU and comes with fully 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, which is arguably overkill for mobile gaming, especially within the confines of a handheld. In practice, Strix Halo has therefore thus far been of more interest as a tool for running local AI models on a limited budget than for gaming. But what if there was a cheaper model that kept the 40 graphics CUs and 256-bit memory bus, but cut the CPU d…",

It's China's latest bid to break away from US-made tech, and follows news back in August that data centre operators were being instructed to source at least 50% of their chips from domestic manufacturers . Now, data centres that are less than 30% complete are being instructed to remove already installed chips if they're foreign-made. One facility in a northwestern province that planned to deploy Nvidia chips has allegedly already been suspended before even breaking ground as a result of the latest guidance. However, it's being decided on a case-by-case basis whether data centre projects at a more advanced stage can keep their foreign-made chips.

One semiconductor research team claims to have achieved just that by stacking not chips or dies, but individual transistors. The work by the team at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia was published in Nature Electronics (via El País ), and as is always the case for such academic research, it's all very complicated. Basically, though, it comes down to the idea that chip makers are looking to go up , rather than using smaller transistors or wider dies, to keep Moore's 'law' alive. Processors such as AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilise hybrid bonding techniques to stack dies on top of each other, to increase the number of transistors in the whole package, so there's more cache.

But the bugs piling higher than a locust swarm in a grain silo threatened to undermine the game's foundations. The first batch of bugfixes landed with immediate effect, addressing issues like deformed pets and vanishing ghost children. Slightly later than planned, the second QoL patch has now arrived, fixing more than 150 problems raised by the community on the EA forums and social media. As with any systems-heavy game, The Sims 4's complex web of interactions often produces patch notes that read more like a comedy script than an actual changelog, and this latest update includes some classics of the genre.

Now, Bethesda would like you to know it's gearing up to break your mods once more, but at least it's a limited subset of them this time. With Fallout 4's 10th-anniversary edition gearing up for launch in the next week, the studio's warned players that it's going to break any main menu mods they might have come November 10, presumably because Todd Howard just gets a sick thrill from it.

Indeed, CEO Lisa Su summed it all up succinctly: \"We delivered an outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability.\" Overall revenue was up 36% to $9.2 billion, while profits grew by 31% to $2.2 billion. Remember, these numbers are for the third quarter of 2025, alone. But from a PC Gaming perspective, the really good news is that the figures weren't all about selling AI chips to the likes of OpenAI. Sure, AMD's data centre revenue was up 22% year-over-year to a record $4.3 billion, making it the largest single contributor. But combined client and gaming revenue increased even more, up 73% year-over-year to $4 billion. In other words, AMD is still pulling in almost as much cash from PC processors and graphics chips as it does from servers and AI clients. \"Our PC processor business is performing exceptionally well with record quarterly sales as the strong demand environment and breadth of our leadership Ryzen portfolio accelerates growth,\" Su says. Even gaming graphics, often the laggard when AMD reports its financials, are looking up. \"In gaming, revenue incre…",

You might be shocked as I was ( appalled as I was, mortified as I was) to discover that People Magazine, a publication for normal, well-adjusted readers, made no mention of the fact that Jonathan Bailey has voiced a catboy in a videogame since 2017. It mostly focuses on what he likes to do on a day off, what he'd tell his 15-year-old self, and how a perfect date night for the man would go. Where's my G'raha lore, People? For shame. Anyway—it's really nice to see Bailey continue to meet with success. He was getting work beforehand, mind, but his international stardom's grown exponentially since 2020. Which I have to admit is probably due to him starring in Bridgerton and not because he voiced my favourite scion. He also starred in 2024's Wicked movie, which is based on a musical you might've heard of. I'm confident his new appellation won't go to his head, though. One of the things I like about Bailey, aside from his performance, is that he doesn't regard his work as G'raha with any less importance than his sta…",

As announced in a post on the official Minecraft blog , the Dragon Ball Z DLC features a \"hard-hitting adventure that will test your mettle, allow you to strike down villains, and see if you can go over mine-thousand.\" So rather than just adding a set of skins and some new NPCs to the survival mode of Minecraft, it will add an entire arena for you to fight against the series' most popular characters and change the entire survival crafting experience we're used to into a fast-paced fighting game. Each of the roster's 11 characters come with unique abilities to use in battle as well, which will unlock as you defeat each one. However, it's not all about fighting.

The forty-year-old tech may not store much, but it does have a loud sound. Wait, that's not a good thing? In a video titled \" SD Cards are LAME! \", Plummer shows off his DEC RA82 disc drive. \"You can feel it through the floor when it seeks hard\" is what Plummer tells the camera, in what I can only assume is a bit of glee. In order to even get the drive up into their home rack, Plummer ordered a hydraulic scissor lift. \"You don't so much install one of these as you do birth it like an ocean liner\". To get the drive operational with his choice of OS (Unix), Plummer did a low-level format to handle future data, partitioned the disk into different regions for storage, and then created file systems on those partitions. And what does all this weight, size, and effort get you? A whopping 622 MB of storage. That's …",

A fightpad module was included too, so you could swap out either the left or right modules for some tactile six-button action. I'm describing this older model in such detail because this newer Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded (now labelled 'by Turtle Beach') is functionally identical to that older PC controller . There are some minor changes once you scratch the surface, but before I get to those, let's re-iterate what carries forward. Like its predecessor, the Victrix Pro Reloaded has the nowadays essential \"pro\" features, including four programmable paddle buttons, trigger stops on the L2 / R2 switches, and Hall effect analog sticks.

It's a lot to juggle, admittedly, but Arc Raiders has two features more extraction games need: detailed item cards and an optional auto-unloading backpack. Each item, no matter how flashy or mundane, will have a description that tells you not only what it is and what it's used for, but also roughly where to find it. There are a few outliers with inaccurate or misleading descriptions, but for the most part, you know exactly what each item can do for you.

Having spent enough time with the console to create an alarmingly accurate mould of the DualSense controller with nothing but my palm prints, I think I'm qualified in saying this: the PS5 is a bit chunky, innit? YouTube maker channel Not From Concentrate apparently shares this sentiment, having shrunk the standard, bulky console into a comparatively svelte 6-litre chassis (via Videocardz ). While the base version of the PlayStation 5 is a comparatively chunkier 10.4 litres, the slim—with the detachable disc drive that looks kinda like a zit to me—is only about 7 and a half litres. So, yes, you do lose those eye-catchingly swoopey white wings but you do gain back a whole lot of space around your TV. This isn't Not From Concentrate's first attempt at a tiny PS5 build , but this latest project features support for full size M.2 form factor SSDs, and enjoys a much bigger potential storage capacity for all of your games as a result.

Developer Build a Rocket Boy has added two of the most-requested features—a dodge roll and the option to shoulder-swap—though players clamoring for a melee attack will have to keep waiting for that one. Unusually, this update also removes a feature. As the patch notes put it, \"Free Roam is taking a short break but will return soon.\" The free-roam mode wasn't a well-loved part of MindsEye, forcing you to play as a character players dubbed \"Can't Drink Dust Guy\" because he's an old man in a gas mask and inexplicable outfit with the words CAN'T DRINK DUST written across his bare stomach—the first of many baffling choices. MindsEye's free-roam mode cut you loose in an open city where you could only drive a…",

    "body": "I tried playing the original Baldur's Gate as a kid, but I had next to no understanding of D&D in 1998 and wound up bouncing off BioWare's legendary RPG because I just kept dying. Over time, some of the more esoteric aspects of videogame RPGs were sanded away, and when BioWare got to the action RPGs of the Mass Effect series, I had no problem joining the party.

But something was lost when RPGs became blockbusters rather than adaptations of pen-and-paper games, and The Outer Worlds 2 game director Brandon Adler is happy to see RPGs like Baldur's Gate 3 force players to pay more attention to their build choices and the game world. \"In general, it feels like many games, but RPGs in particular, are like, 'Well, you're not allowed to make bad choices, so every character build is viable, and we make sure that no matter what you do, everything's going to be fine,'\" Adler told GamesRadar+ in a recent interview. \"And you know, the problem with that, at least in my opinion, is that for those choices to matter, they have to be things that could be good or bad, depending on what you're doing.\" Adler recounted watching streamers make…",
