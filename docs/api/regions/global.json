Playing through a new hands-on demo showing off more of its dark vision of Seattle, I'm struck by how much it nails the atmosphere of the original tabletop RPG. If you were a goth kid in the '90s, you are going to feel completely at home. Between two preview builds, I've now played about 3 hours of Bloodlines 2, and in terms of its authenticity, I'm sold. From the moonlit streets, to the moody fashion, to the derelict mansions and art deco apartments, it couldn't feel more like a world where sexy-cool vampires would be at home. And there's no shyness about taking the tabletop lore seriously—concepts like the Camarilla and the Masquerade aren't just background, they're core to the story. (Image credit: Paradox Interactive) It can feel a bit like Proper Noun Overload, and there is something inherently stuffy about a lot of the bloodsucker politics. But that's punctured nicely by the two playable characters—Phyre, an ancient vampire awoken from over hundred years of slumber, and Fabien, a disembodied 1940s vampire detective who lives in their head (for slightly tangled reasons).…",

But sometimes, just sometimes, a piece of tech ends up dominating for a long time without anyone coming close to beating what makes it so good. That's been the case for the longest time for the best gaming mouse , and more specifically, the best MMO gaming mouse. Razer's Naga, in many different guises, has historically held the top spot for that particular category. But no longer, as Corsair has broken into our guide with the superlative Scimitar Elite Wireless SE , which is now absolutely the best MMO gaming mouse . Previously, the Razer Naga Pro held the position thanks to its swappable button facias and excellent battery life. But the Corsair mouse has knocked it off the list because it's just such a versatile gaming mouse.

That's easily the best 4K gaming monitor you can buy right now, but for me, it's not just about gaming, as I use my main PC for image and video editing, as well as messing about with Unreal Engine. I'd hate to try and do all that on something smaller or with fewer pixels. Of course, you ideally need a beefy graphics card to game at 4K and certainly for today's big releases with spangly ray-traced visuals. But what if you don't have one but still need a big, high-resolution screen for work? Well, you can just run your games at 1080p, but then it'll look all blurry. One solution is the current in-thing in the world of displays: dual-mode monitors. These are natively 4K in resolution but, at the touch of a button, they switch to 1080p. To counter the inherent blurring this normally produces, manufacturers employ a host of clever pixel blending tricks, and our current recommendation for the best 4K dual-mode monitor, the Alienware AW2725QF , does a very good job of it all.

One of the reasons given for the termination was the state of the game. The founders believed that it was ready for an early access launch and planned to go through with it; Krafton, meanwhile, believed it wasn't ready for its debut and that the founders had been shirking their duties . But there's been a surprising U-turn, with Krafton significantly changing its argument. The lawsuit is now in the discovery phase, so Fortis Advisors, which represents the ousted founders, sought discovery to see if Krafton held evidence to back up its claims. \"But despite its obvious relevance, Krafton feigned astonishment during the parties' meet and confers at how it could possibly be part of Phase I,\" Fortis said.

The idea being, if you bring together both companies' tech, it's possible to deliver something more flexible, more desirable than either company can deliver on its own. The benefits for the two companies are clear enough. Nvidia needs processors for GPU-accelerated server racks, and despite its best efforts to buy Arm, that fell through, dashing any hope of becoming a fully-integrated hardware company with it. Intel needs a helping hand in a few ways. The company is struggling with a falling share price and recently struck a deal with the US government to buy a share of the business, and getting an in with one of the richest companies on the planet isn't a bad get. Though supercharging its processors with more capable and powerful graphics chips has a few big benefits, too.

The announcement also broke the news of a $5 billion investment by Nvidia into Intel's common stock, at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. According to sources speaking to The New York Times , the Trump administration approached Nvidia in January and asked it to invest in the chipmaker. The US government has since made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel itself, which is now estimated to be worth $13 billion as a result of Intel's share price rising by near 23% off the back of yesterday's news.

Not many folks, that's for sure. Likewise, I should imagine only die-hard Team Red fans at the start of the decade would have predicted that the best choice for a new CPU , regardless of price point or use scenario, would be an AMD processor. And yet, all of the above have come to pass, and in the case of the last point, we've decided it's time to change our recommendation for the best budget gaming CPU.

    "body": "Our Jeremy said it best when he reported on the surprise announcement of an Intel-Nvidia collaboration yesterday: it's cats living with dogs. Naturally, such a strange occurrence has led people to question just how it will affect current product roadmaps—especially Intel Arc. On that front, thankfully, Intel says things are business as usual. An Intel spokesperson has supplied a statement to the media saying that: \"collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings\" (via PC World and Hot Hardware ). That's pretty unambiguous, at least for the short term. Intel's roadmap, to be clear, currently includes at least two new generations of processor containing its Arc Xe3 iGPUs: Panther Lake and Nova Lake. The former should launch relatively soon, will be mobile (ie, laptop)-only, and will at least in part be made using the company's new 18A node—although early yields apparently aren't looking too promising . The latter will arrive later and should have both desktop and mobile options, just like current-gen Arrow Lake, and looks to be made on TSMC's N2 node.

Few were going to make time for a handsome but orthodox pixel art metroidvania when the joys and indignities of Pharloom beckon. Except me: I needed a break from Silksong earlier this week, mostly because I was getting my ass kicked, but also because a small detail on the Adventure of Samsara Steam page piqued my interest. This is actually a spiritual sequel of sorts to the 1980 game Adventure , which was probably the most cryptic and sprawling Atari 2600 cart on the market. Adventure gave me nightmares as a child. Whereas most Atari 2600 games were cheerfully straightforward one-screen arcade games or scrolling shooters, Adventure had designs on being a full-blown, well, adventure, and it displayed some proto-metroidvania qualities to that end.

That's good news for Resident Evil fans who might otherwise be a bit wary about yet another new Resi movie—the film franchise was already rebooted once, just four years ago, with the thoroughly mid Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Cregger's track record, though based on a small sample size (at least when it comes to feature films) is a good reason to be optimistic. And for those wondering which game and characters this new Resi movie will be based on, it looks like the answer is: none of them. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Cregger confirmed that while the 2026 film will take place in the Resident Evil universe, \"It's an entirely original story,\" instead of being based on any one specific game. Cregger is also steering away from major Resident Evil characters like Leon S. Kennedy. \"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story.

Thanks to the efforts of a Tokyo contributor who was able to review the case file for the ongoing Pocketpair lawsuit, videogame patent law site Games Fray (which broke last week's Nintendo patent story) reports that part of Pocketpair's defense against Nintendo's lawsuit aims to invalidate Nintendo's patent claims based on the existence of prior art in mods. (Image credit: Pocketpair / Toasted Shoes / The Pokemon Company) As IP attorney Kirk Sigmon told PC Gamer last September, demonstrable prior art—meaning preexisting work resembling the invention described in a patent's claims—is bad news for patent holders, because it means they shouldn't have been granted the patent in the first place.

If that sounds like the beginning of a eulogy…yeah. It isn't technically dead, and there's a universe where BioWare makes some incredible comeback with Mass Effect 4, but I don't think it's this one. After Andromeda, Anthem, and Veilguard, it seems that no matter the talent still left in the studio, EA just isn't going to give BioWare the time or trust to make the kind of RPGs it originally spearheaded anymore. I'm finally ready to let go. If you too are mourning the studio's effective downfall, rest assured that the BioWare-style RPG lives on elsewhere. My colleague Fraser Brown insisted back in 2023 that the BioWare-style RPG was dead and just didn't know it yet. At the time I almost even agreed, but two years later it feels like we've finally arrived breathless at a tough summit to look down into a valley of plenty in the big-budget, story-forward party RPG scene.

With Techland posting some seriously heavy system requirements and Nvidia partnering once more for RTX and DLSS additions , I was concerned that Dying Light: The Beast would be joining a growing list of recent games that don't run very well on PC. Having tested the game on a broad range of hardware, I can tell you now that it's actually all fine, even when the performance is lower than you'd like. This is especially true if you stick to 1080p or 1440p, and even though Dying Light: The Beast proudly wears an 'I love upscaling' t-shirt, you should have no problems getting a respectable frame rate on most modern gaming PCs.

The Ryzen 5 7600X3D chip in the OcUK Mach 5R excited me because it feels like a perfect compromise pick. You're still getting that sweet, sweet 3D V-Cache technology and the gaming performance boosts that come with it, but at a lower price point than usual, which allows you to throw a little more cash at the points that really matter to you. Being a six-core CPU with 96 MB of L3 cache, it's sort of like a Ryzen 7 7800X3D (the CPU in my home rig) but with two fewer cores and a lower clock speed. When it launched late last year, it was initially a US-only Micro Center exclusive, with limited availability. In a rig like this, one with a beefy GPU but at a mid-range price point, getting 3D cache for the cheapest possible seems like a smart play. I was initially worried that games like Borderlands 4, whose official system specs name an eight-core CPU as a minimum , would mean the rig would be bottlenecked. Turns out,…",

What you've made here is an AI-powered Tribble , and now those of us in the US and the UK can pick one up for $429 / £369 . The once-Japan-only device is said to be many things, including a calming presence, a quiet reassurance, and something that \"responds, understands, and grows with you.\" Essentially, it's an AI trapped inside a cuddly robotic fursuit, and one that Casio seems to think is perfect for stress relief ( via Digital Trends ). The Moflin is capable of moving and tilting its head, responding to light and touch, and listening to your darkest fantas... I mean, your vocalisations through a built-in microphone. Not only that, but it'll adjust its behaviour based on an AI-powered emotional spectrum, which Casio says allows it to \"express a diverse range of feelings.\" It can be grumpy, thrilled, joyful, anxious, lonely, calm, happy... in fact, it sounds like a right needy little git, and that's apparently part of the appeal. Patting, hugging, or speaking to the furry little critter apparently sparks positive emotions in i…",

I dunno—I'm too busy sacrificing mortals to a great and terrible machine in an attempt to resurrect an army of chivalrous ghosts and super-charge my economy. It's been a busy day. Such is the life of a ruler on Saiadha, the water-logged setting of Endless Legend 2. This bizarre, constantly shifting planet has stories to tell: of lost spacefarers, of secrets buried beneath the planet, of species fleeing extinction and fighting for dominance. You'll face gods, commit atrocities in the name of survival and cover the map in gorgeous, city-shaped dioramas.

After all, it's hard not to spread a little joy in the office, or at least to crack a smile yourself, when you're wearing cat ears. Pink is far from my favourite colour, as I tend to sport a more pro-purple agenda, but I'm not eager to kick out Razer's latest iteration of the Kraken Kitty headset. Available in both white and black colourways alongside the aforementioned 'quartz', the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro headset offers more than the novelty of feline flair. Costing $180/£180, it had better. As with every Kraken Kitty, the cat ears remain the crown jewel of this headset. To be clear, the charming interchangeable ears of the pricy V2 Pro are gone; we're now back to full-size animal ears rather than the V2 Pro's oddly diminutive accessories throwing off the proportions of what is an already bulky headset. The kitty ears here are sturdy, solidly anchored to the headband, and immediately eye-catching. With all of that hardware on top, you may think the V3 Pro would be fatiguing to wear.
