Although the company's actual keebs don't rank on our list of the best gaming keyboards , the switches are in a league of their own—or they used to be, at least. However, Cherry seems to have fallen on hard times, with a net loss of $23 million (20.4 million euros) between January and the end of September 2025.

Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general \"peripherals\" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.

Together, these chips could represent the start of a new processing paradigm which could do for the AI industry what ASICs did for bitcoin mining. In both cases, we're talking about chips broadly known as TPUs or tensor processing units. They're a kind of ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit, that's designed at hardware level to do a very narrow set of AI-related tasks very well. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs, even its AI-specific GPUs as opposed to its gaming GPUs, are more general purpose in nature. The parallel here is bitcoin mining, which used to be done on graphics cards before a new generation of dedicated mining chips, also ASICs, came along and did the same job much more efficiently. Could the same transition from more general purpose GPUs to ASICs hit the AI industry? The Chinese startup is Zhonghao Xinying. Its Ghana chip is claimed to offer 1.5 times the performance of Nvidia's…",

It's done good by developer Neowiz, too—not only selling well , but also pulling in an award for Best Game Expansion during the Golden Joystick Awards. Speaking to GamesRadar via interpreter, director Choi Ji-won is honoured to receive the accolade: \"I'm so happy that I'm lost for words right now … we didn't just view it as just pure expansion, but almost as a sequel and a brand new project.\" As for the actual Lies of P sequel that's in the works, Choi Ji-Won asks fans to \"please stay tuned for it; we are working really hard, and I will not disappoint you at all.\" And you know what, I fully believe him. Overture is, in my humble opinion, one of the best DLCs released for a soulslike game period—it's imaginative and well-designed, sure, but it also marks Neowiz finally finding its legs after a game that initially struck critics ( including us, I'm sorry to say ) as a Bloodborne carbon copy.

Eyup. Unlike the numerous attempts to play Doom on increasingly basic technology— a vape , or itself , for instance—this isn't about getting the game itself to run on the device. In smillgames' scenario, a different device is running Minecraft as normal. The receipt printer is merely used as a monitor of sorts, as he shared in a post on X . my next video might actually be the dumbest thing I've ever done pic.twitter.com/HFz6bAiCYH November 22, 2025 There is precedent for this; I think smill is getting the same sort of FPS I was getting on Oblivion back in the day.

A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct. For those who haven't seen Kill Bill, or maybe just forgot, one of the film's secondary fights is a showdown between The Bride and Gogo Yubari , a teenage psycho killer in the employ of O-Ren Ishii, head of the yakuza in Tokyo. Gogo dies, rather badly (spoiler, sorry), and then, well, so does everyone else. The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film. Based on the teaser, Yuki is basically Gogo, except maybe a little psychotically peppier and with a fondness for guns rather than a meteor hammer.

It won't play any of the classics, but it'll definitely fill you with nostalgia. The project comes with a total of 2,130 Lego pieces, and a big part of that will go towards the computer itself. The sleek PC looks almost just like the real thing, including a realistic keyboard with keys you can actually press. The keyboard alone accounts for 100 printed tiles, with stuff you're unlikely to find on keyboards of today, including \"GOTO,\" \"GOSUB,\" \"LOAD,\" and \"RUN.\" In the very corner of the ZX Spectrum, you'll find rainbow stripes, just like on the real thing.

    "body": "\" Rainbow Six Siege has Steam achievements\" may not immediately strike you as the most interesting news ever, but it is interesting for one simple reason: It took 10 years—an entire decade—to happen. The big news was announced in a very low-key fashion: \"We are pleased to announce that Steam Achievements are now available for Rainbow Six Siege!\" Ubisoft wrote on Steam . It also confirmed that, thankfully, the Steam cheevos will be granted retroactively, so you won't have to redo everything you've already done to earn them: Any previously unlocked Ubisoft Connect achievements will be automatically unlocked on Steam the next time you log into the game. (Image credit: Ubisoft (Steam)) Ubisoft didn't say exactly why a game that came out in 2015, and that transformed itself into the free-to-play Rainbow Six Siege X earlier this year, is suddenly now getting Steam achievements. But at this point I think we can safely say that it's kind of the Ubisoft way : After trying its luck with Epic Games Store exclusivity , Ubisoft came crawling back to Steam (just like everyone else ) in 2024, and it's been slowly but surely adding achievements to long-neglected games ever since.

Dell's COO Jeffrey Clarke says during the earnings call : \"We have not completed the Windows 11 transition.\" I wish I could call that shocking, but it's really not. It took until July 2025 for Windows 11 to overtake Windows 10 as the most popular Microsoft operating system. That was nearly four years since its initial release, and was likely spurred by the fact that Windows 10 was reaching the end of support. We saw an uptick of Windows 11 users in a recent Steam Hardware Survey , showing just how many users were holding off until the last minute. (Image credit: Microsoft) Dell compared the rate at which people are upgrading now to the time when people were making the switch to Windows 10.

I know they say don't judge a book by its cover, but if I've got loot and there's another raider nearby, I've not got long to make a move to decide our fates. I'm usually one to say hi and reveal my location first, and shoot only if I need to.

Those of you hip to pattern recognition might note that those predecessor games seemed to get multiple expansions (Origins, likewise, got multiple), but it seems that won't be the case for Shadows. In a chat with JorRaptor (via IGN ), the game's associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois said that, \"at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned, currently.\" Which is a tad surprising, given Ubisoft's recent statement that the game is \" Overperforming \" against its expectations. I think the wording here is worth bearing in mind. Ubi's got no mondo-size expansions in the pipe, but Lemay-Comtois notes that \"We're still working on content for post-launch, and supporting it,\" so it's not quite as though the game is just being dropped.

    "body": "You ask me (which, by clicking on this article, you did), Yakuza 0 is one of the best games I ever played. It's so good—such a pitch-perfect blend of high drama and high camp, and with perhaps the most engrossing minigame known to man packed in—that I kind of struggle to pick up other Yakuza games. I feel like I've already spent 100+ hours with the best one. If you're one of the unlucky few who's yet to pick the game up, you may want to get on that. Sega's announced that, when Yakuza 0's spruced-up Director's Cut releases on December 8, the original version's getting delisted. So far, Sega's only said it's getting delisted on Steam, and I'm not sure if that will also apply to other storefronts. I've reached out to Sega to ask about this, and will update if I hear back. You might think that's not such a big deal. After all, the Director's Cut will contain all the parts of the original game inside it like a beautiful criminal pupa, but the shift also entails a big change in the game's price. Right now, you can pick up original Yakuza 0 for a paltry $20. When it launches, the Director's Cut will set you back $50. Sega even—a little cheekily, I think—notes that if you were to pick up …",

Which, one might worry, could eventually include drugs. As a matter of fact, its creator Tyler tells our friends over at GamesRadar that this was enough of a concern to develop a backup plan in case Steam didn't accept the game to its platform: \"Early during development, I had a plan where, if Steam wouldn't take it for whatever reason, I could just pivot it to be a farming game. Just strip all the drug stuff out, make it a farming game—but thankfully, it was all right.\" That's not to say Tyler's had it easy when it comes to international censorship or ratings issues. Easy enough to be a bestseller, sure, but not entirely immune to oversight: \"A couple of countries don't love it; that's fine. Australia was one of them for a little while.

Issues with free loadout players have been exacerbated by Stella Montis, the smallest and most aggressive map in Arc Raiders, as players are seeing more killer free loadouters than usual. People who use free loadouts get given a low-level gun, ammo, shield, and health, not a lot, but enough to do well, but with none of their stuff on the line, so they can be more aggressive than usual.

Reputable leaker Golden Pig Upgrade Pack on Weibo (via VideoCardz ) claims Nvidia is planning to stop bundling VRAM with its GPU dies. Nvidia always supplied both the GPU and the VRAM to its add-in card (AIC) partners... well, potentially up until now. This made it easier for GPU manufacturers to stay on spec, but also removed the need for them to source DRAM directly from memory giants like Micron or Samsung. So, Nvidia took care of the VRAM and the GPU die, and the AIC did whatever they wanted with the rest of it, customizing the graphics card before selling it. If Nvidia has indeed decided to only ship the GPU going forward, its board partners will now need to secure VRAM all on their own. Given how volatile normal memory pricing is right now , that could be a challenge for some brands. The short supply of memory doesn't just affect the RAM kits we stick in our PCs.

This news comes somewhat cryptically from one of the most reliable leakers in the business, kopite7kimi (via WCCFTech ). It's a slightly convoluted data trail. But to cut a long story short, kopite7kimi responded to a story discussing 144 MB verticle cache allocations, which is expected to be known as bLLC or big last level cache in Intel parlance.

Paradox announced a write-down of 355 million SEK/$37 million/£28 million (cheers IGN ) of capitalised development costs, reflecting that the development costs won't generate the profits the publisher previously anticipated. This is based on an updated sales forecast made a month after Bloodlines 2's launch. Wester places the blame firmly on Paradox's shoulders. \"The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge …",

However, things could've been very different. That's per a Polygon interview with narrative director Pierre Shorette, who told the site: \"In the very original script, you basically picked your starter Pokémon. You didn't have a team. You showed up and [your boss] is like 'pick someone you want to mentor.'\" Who would those starting three be, you might ask? Maybe a pick between Flambae, Malevola, and Invisigal? Wrong. AdHoc's original vision for the game saw you choosing between a troubled criminal with strong ties to the central story and themes, a perpetually wet nerd, and a guy in a fursuit. That's right, Mr Whiskey (who I assume is the only thing keeping SDN's Torrance branch together) would've been a starting option as someone Robert would closely mentor.

The friend symbol, for example, lets you summon a little minion to fight with you, while a bone grants you armour against an enemy hit. As you choose and apply effects, at any point you can choose to re-roll all of your dice up to twice, to fish for specific ones you need. And… that's kind of it. There is some gentle nuance to it. Wands, for example, let you apply damage directly to an enemy, but need to be charged with books to gain damage. Mana stacks up until you have enough to cast a spell, at which point all mana faces become your equipped spell instead, freely cast until the end of the turn. And stopwatches have a chance to stun enemies, or else reduce their resistance for a better chance to stun them next time. (Image credit: Heckmou…",

If you're struggling to save the Dino Kid, Kraken Kid, Squid Kid, and Koala Kid, don't worry. I've rescued all four more times than I'd like to admit, so here's what you need to know to find all of the Lost Children in 99 Nights in the Forest. How to find the missing children in 99 Nights in the Forest (Image credit: Grandma's Favourite Games) Starting a new game means starting a new 99 Nights in the Forest map, so there's no simple solution to finding all four of the Lost Children at a set location. You can, however, rely on sev…",

(Yet despite skipping class the day we learned about the War of the Austrian Succession, I still haven't invaded Silesia. I knew that guy was full of it!) But forget real history (I always do) and let's talk about videogame history. You probably remember the year, and maybe even the day, your favorite videogame was released, especially if you're now counting the days, and maybe even the years, until the sequel comes out. Time to put your release date knowledge to the test in our first \"sort 'em out\" style quiz. In each question in the quiz below, I'll give you three games, and all you have to do is put them in order of their release, from earliest to latest. I'm not asking you to know the specific dates, you just have to put 'em in the right order by dragging and dropping 'em. Good luck, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

This week, as spotted by GamesRadar , BG3 players have found a way to recruit a fighting force of the most powerful beings in Larian's version of Faerun. It's children. They're building armies of children. The process is laid out in a YouTube short from BG3 aficionado and seeming evil mastermind Morgana Evelyn titled \"Child Labour is Unbeatable.\" That name alone should tell you what kind of moral dimensions we're working with here. If the idea of conscripting a horde of combat orphans doesn't pass your ethical sniff test, you probably won't enjoy where the rest of this goes. To pull this off, you'll need a level 7 Companion character with access to the Dominate Beast and Polymorph spells. With that character, you'll need to select your ideal child combatant—or because they all perform identically, any child combatant—and polymorph them. Once they're in sheep shape, hit them with Dominate Beast, and then travel to your camp. Once there, Morgana recommends ena…",

When played on (or even near) those laptops, the song would cause the drives to malfunction—and it was such a widespread problem that Microsoft incorporated code into Windows XP to filter out that particular frequency. Sounds unbelievable, but it's true! Audio experts, laptop makers and Windows developers all worked together to confirm the story—so when I was re-reading the 2022 Microsoft blog that first made the story news, I suddenly found myself wondering what other damage precisely the right (or, I suppose, wrong) sound frequency could do. For example: Could you cause a chicken's head to explode with just the power of sound? A comment on the 2022 blog casually suggests that perhaps such a thing is possible. \"There is also the story of the resonant frequency of chicken skulls from the old Borland Turbo C++ documentation,\" it says.

That's a tremendous deal on one of the best (and only) big budget singleplayer shooters in recent years, especially considering it's barely six months old. Is it the best Doom of the modern trilogy? No, but id gave itself a tough act to follow, and The Dark Ages is still gigantic and impressive in different ways than Doom '16 and its 2020 followup, Eternal.
