    "body": "Andrzej Sapkowski recently wrote a prequel to his Witcher novels, Crossroads of Ravens . At an event to publicize that novel, our colleagues at GamesRadar asked the author if he'd been involved in any part of the development of The Witcher 4. And he said, basically: nope. While explaining that the developers at CD Projekt Red did ask for advice and extra details about the setting while working on the previous games, these days apparently \"it's so rare\" that CDPR contact him to ask about the lore. Which makes sense, given how much the studio has added to it over the course of the Witcher games, like building Witcher schools based on an off-hand reference he threw in before regretting it . The other thing Sapkowski had to say about his relationship with CDPR is that, \"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now. Let's hope it stays that way.\" That was in reference to the lawsuit CDPR settled with Sapkowski in 2019 over royalties, with the author asserting that he'd handed over the rights for a pittance compared to the amount they ended up being worth.

Responding to an article by IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine about the videogame Love and Deepspace's failure to account for nonwhite characters when lighting scenes, Zelle highlighted how Volition handled that challenge in Saints Row: The Third, Skinballs. Skinballs was made up of four spheres, each textured in a different flesh tone and used by artists to ensure scenes were properly lit for characters of all potential skin colors. Borman, the director of digital preservation at the Strong, expressed his own appreciation for Skinballs , and noted that it's become a bit of a memetic delight in various mod communities, sort of like that purple checkerboard missing texture pattern you see in Source engine games. This prompted Zelle and Salvatore to realize and celebrate that Skinballs is now part of a museum collection. The Strong preserves and showcases…",

To win you'll have to build up a base of resources to keep a collection of valiant heroes fed and armed. Each time you build up a new kingdom you'll kick off with a choice of hero, like knight or priestess, as the core of your autobattling army. During the first days you'll build up a base of resources, like stone and wood, before using them to expand your production chains into the big stuff: meals. Every hero has a favorite meal to eat that lets them level up faster, a key to staying ahead of ever-escalating enemy forces. We first got a good look at Super Fantasy Kingdom a while back , and really got intrigued during the December 2024 PC Gaming show, when we saw the undead faction . The roguelike bits between waves are some of the most entertaining parts: As you explore the world beyond your little kingdom you unlock new heroes to recruit, 50-some in total, as well as small static bonuses and new buildings to diversify your economy.

Dusk Gulch is a riff on Halo's classic, 2fort-y capture the flag arena, Blood Gulch . You can load up modder Vriska's latest work in the Duskworld multiplayer mode if you'd like, but it was primarily designed for the game's wave survival mode. I tried out a few rounds for myself, and it's great. Dusk Gulch is a much smaller, more intimate affair than Blood Gulch, and I did some wiki research to make sure that wasn't just my middle school memories playing tricks on me. The scale makes sense for its intended purpose, and it even has fun-size versions of distinct map features like the high path on one side of the canyon, and the protected cave route on the other. The bases themselves are small fortifications with a jump pad in the center, and usually see weapon and ammo spawns depending on what wave you've reached. It's frantic, claustrophobic, and fun. Plus, it had been a minute since I'd actually loaded up Dusk at all, and I'd forgotten just how good it is. Dusk has proudly joined its inspirations, Half-Life and Quake, in the ranks of …",

In a Steam post , Mechanistry explained that the 1.0 update will be \"different from anything we've done before.\" Rather than targeting a specific area of the experience, the 1.0 version \"expands the game across the board\" and brings \"many other little things that both you and we wanted to see in the game.\" This begins with a wide array of new map objects that you'll discover as you expand your beavers' metropolis. These include several natural phenomena like aquifers and geothermal fields, which you can exploit with discoverable tech like geothermal engines and aquifer drills. Other objects being introduced are more hazardous, like brambles that can harm your beavers when they try to clear them, and unstable cores that might explode should your beavers approach too closely. Elsewhere, the update will add two more maps to play on, each bringing distinct challenges. 'Pressure' situates al…",

But Rockstar's original schoolyard simulator is about to receive a new lease of life. Thanks to a team of modders, Bully is getting an online mode, the enthusiast equivalent of what GTA Online is to GTA 5 . If you think that comparison is overblown, well, it probably is, given the years and countless dollars Rockstar has pumped into its multiplayer version of Los Santos. Nonetheless, Bully Online is still far more involved than I expected. Not only does the mod open up the town of Bullworth for persistent multiplayer shenanigans, but it also adds numerous supplementary systems to Rockstar's virtual playground. These include a roleplaying system, player-based inventory, and a trading system that lets you earn money and spend it on houses, weapons, vehicles etc. The mod also introduces several minigames to Bully, some of which are pretty …",

You'll certainly have less of it by the time you're done reading this review, and less still if you decide to pick up Hyperbeat: a rhythm game that roped me in with its oddball UI, low-poly dreamscapes, and atmospheric central hub full of NPCs eager to introspect with you. It is a small, severe world that quickly charmed me. While all rhythm games are about timing, time writ large, which you have a little less of by now, is Hyperbeat's foremost obsession. One hub NPC is a musician who longs for their bygone depression, if only because it was a source of inspiration in the days before their \"flop era.\" Another is a churlish artist whose precious moments are wasted fretting over the feedback of an audience (or talking to you, for that matter).

That testing phase is rapidly approaching its end, however, as PP has announced its survival roguelike will arrive in early access on November 20. For the uninitiated, Prologue: Go Wayback is a deceptively simple game about hiking from a cabin in the woods to a distant weather tower, where each run is completely unique thanks to maps generated by the studio's homebrewed machine-learning technology. Normally generative AI use is a huge no from me, but PP's systems are built in-house, created using publicly available data and used only to generate the game's hyper-realistic terrain, which is then supplemented by more traditional procgen systems and 3D art.

In November the North Line update will bring the first beefy patch that'll make more substantial changes to the state of play. North Line's biggest addition will be the Stella Montis map, adding a new region of the Rust Belt that's currently, tantalizingly locked on the in-game world map. And to ensure we don't have too good of a time exploring the new area, the November update will also bring new Arc enemies: the Matriarch and the Shredder. I'm sure they're lovely.

While the patent application in question, JP 2024-031879 , isn't directly relevant to the Palworld lawsuit, it's related to patents that are: It's the child application of one of the patents asserted in Nintendo's accusations and is itself the parent application of another. The rejection, therefore, could give Pocketpair a rhetorical opportunity to encourage a similar investigation of the patents it's accused of infringing.

Well, luckily, Corsair has announced a new professional-looking fighter stick, and I can't wait to lose at my local tournament with it. The Novablade Pro Wireless has Hall effect magnetic switches, which not only ensure a longer shelf life but also allow custom actuation on the board. Keys can be set from anywhere to 0.1mm to 4mm, which means you can make surrounding keys a little harder to press and important ones easier to hit. Corsair says switches can be hit up to 150 million times, which is approximately three games for the average button basher. Speaking of button bashers, this fight controller has rapid trigger keys, which means they stop pressing the second you do. A more traditional switch starts and stops pressing at a certain actuation, which means you are losing milliseconds with each hit. That allows you to not only hit keys quicker, but also more often. Being wireless, it can be connected via Bluetooth, or connected to your rig in 2.4 GHz mode, offering lower latency th…",

And such people do exist: I've seen them. Plenty of people won't give a lightweight mouse a real go, and some still won't try out wireless. Switching to a lightweight wireless gaming mouse has probably given me the biggest upgrade to my gaming experience I've had since I jumped from a 60 Hz to a 144 Hz monitor back in the day. It took me a long time to come around to it, as I tend to stick with what I'm used to, …",

The idea seemed to spring out of discussions around the capabilities of the upcoming Tesla AI5 chip, which is said to be up to 40x faster than the current Tesla AI4 chip fitted to many of its cars (via Tom's Hardware ). Musk openly wondered if the upcoming chip \"might almost be too much intelligence for a car\", which led to his pitching of a concept he seems to have been rolling around for a while: \"One of the things I thought,\" said Musk, \"If we've got all of these cars that maybe are bored... we could actually have a giant distributed inference fleet... if they're not actively driving\" \"At some point, if you've got 100 million cars in the fleet... and let's say they had, at the point, a kilowatt of inference capability... that's 100 gigawatts of inference distributed with cooling and power conversion taken care of.

It did not seem positive. \"Oh, what the fuck,\" said O'Flaherty. \"No. This did not need to happen. Sorry whoever was involved in this. Oh man, yeah, no.\" So not exactly a thumbs-up, there. Still, O'Flaherty does—sort of—get a bit more positive. \"If you’re gonna do it, yeah, alright, why not? Why am I judging?\" Which is less approval so much as it is resignation to the whims of fate. I can't fault the guy. Deus Ex was never a graphical powerhouse, but it had a vibe and a cohesive aesthetic all the way back in the year 2000. \"You wanted to lean into what the engine did well and don’t do the shit that it doesn’t do well,\" said O'Flaherty. The remaster, as we've seen it so far, trades all that in for a slapdash up-rezzing of everything, making the game too bright, too bulky, and strangely even more archaic-looking than it did originally.

Narrative twists and turns follow, leading through a story that's not especially novel but still manages to deliver surprises. A lot of that arises from your freedom to make a mess of things: Your in-game avatar isn't the most hard-charging videogame hero imaginable, and there are many ways to die, most of them awful.

This lets you overlay a preset outfit onto your character's gear, and like all MMOs, it's the true endgame. Let's be real, we're just here to play dress-up. We know what we are. There is one caveat, though—you can't glamour items meant for other classes or jobs onto your gear. So a set made for a Fisher can't be used on, say, Lancer equipment. That is, until mid-December of this year.

Cain strikes a pretty pro-digital-distribution tone at the video's start. Being able to stick a game on Steam rather than order print runs of discs means devs have more time to work on games (because there's less lead time between finishing development and shipping), it means games are easier to patch, and it means old games—like the many classics Cain worked on—can remain easily accessible in, hopefully, perpetuity. But where things really heat up is with Cain's thoughts on how digital distribution has impacted game pricing. \"Digital is cheaper,\" says Cain. \"It's cheaper for everybody. It's less cost all around. \"In theory,\" he continues, \"prices should've dropped, but they didn't.\" In Cain's telling of events, rather than spread the wealth out of sheer generosity of spirit, the capitalists just kind of, well, kept it. \"You know those cost savings for being digital?

One YouTuber, Macho Nacho Productions (via Hackaday ), is such a big fan of this aesthetic that they've decided to build their own version, complete with a custom-milled aluminium chassis and the original Xbox internals, albeit with some light upgrades to bring it slightly more into the modern age.. To try and get an understanding of the specific size of the prototype Xbox, Macho Nacho found an image with a Microsoft Sidewinder game pad next to it that was captured at some point in the early 2000s. After comparing a 3D rendering of the two side by side, they then decided that it wasn't quite accurate enough. Macho Nacho took a trip out to New York to see a prototype in a display case, where they took pictures of that case from many angles and sent them to a 3D modeller, where they then created a Gaussian Splat.

Some questionnaire-based psychological evaluation happens before and after these sessions, too.
