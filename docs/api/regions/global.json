Whenever someone passed through the gatehouse, the fake archer would yell \"Who goes there?\" in a big, booming voice. It's a phrase that has always stuck with me for some reason, one of those weird bits of mental detritus that rolls around at the back of the old braincase. Anyway, it got jostled right to the front when I first encountered Gate Guard Simulator, which is basically an entire game about asking the question \"Who Goes There?\" A Papers, Please variant wearing Kingdom Come: Deliverance 's codpiece, Gate Guard simulator puts you in the plate mail of the latest recruit to the castle guard, charged with vetting entry into your lord's domain.

In the last twelve months, Ironclad has introduced features like new scenarios , population mechanics, better tutorials and improved debris visuals for prettier battle aftermaths. Now, a new update takes aim at one of the RTS' weakest areas of play, that trickiest of 4X systems to implement—diplomacy.

The new Larian RPG, which is just called Divinity , is probably not going to require you to be up-to-date on the series lore. But the series has a lot to offer for the curious, even if the games do get pretty crusty the further back you go. Here's what Baldur's Gate 3 fans and anyone else interested in the next big Larian RPG should know about Divinity. What are the games in the Divinity series? What order should you play the Divinity games in? Rather than experiencing the Divinity games chronologically by release date, or according to the internal timeline of the series, we suggest investigating them in reverse order of release . That has you starting with the best of them and working backwards until they get too crusty for you. So our recommendation is: Divinity: Original Sin 2 Divinity: Original Sin Divinity: Dragon Commander (If you're into strategy games) Divinity 2: Ego Draconis Beyond Divinity (you can skip this one u…",

    "body": "When I flew to China to play Phantom Blade Zero earlier this year, I left without one key piece of information: When it would be out. The polished but walled off demo made it hard to tell how much of Phantom Blade Zero was finished, and it seemed equally possible that it would be arriving in early or late 2026. In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one. The release date trailer shows off quite a bit of Phantom Blade Zero we haven't seen before, including at least a couple boss fights and characters related to the story, which S-Games has so far mostly avoided showing.

    "body": "The Epic Games Store's Holiday Sale is now underway—it actually started on December 11 but we were a little busy with other things you may have heard of—and that means, aside from deals, a whole bunch of new free games to pick up. First on the block is a very big one indeed: The hit Harry Potter sim Hogwarts Legacy , which is yours for keeps if you claim it before December 18. Hogwarts Legacy is the proverbial problematic fave: As PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde laid out in 2023, there was quite a bit of controversy when the game first launched over whether or not it was okay to play it , thanks to the notoriously anti-trans politics of author JK Rowling.

Regan is a prolific voice actor whose past roles include Aya in Assassin's Creed: Origins, Alt Cunningham in Cyberpunk 2077, the Inquisitor in Dragon Age, Lea in Lies of P: Overture, and Tasi Trianon in Amnesia: Rebirth. She's also appeared in Return to Monkey Island, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, BioMutant, Trine 2, Mass Effect 3, and numerous others—it's quite an impressive CV. You can get a taste of Regan's take on Lara in the new Tomb Raider announcement trailers—she sounds very Lara-like to me: And hey, just in case you haven't seen it, here's Tomb Raider: Catalyst.

In a tweet posted a few hours before the ceremony, they shared a screenshot of two image folders on a Windows desktop: \"memes if we win GOTY\" and \"memes if we don't win GOTY.\" The latter turned out to come in clutch, as Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was shut out of every category it was nominated for. And it lost every single one of those to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The French RPG took home Best RPG, Best Narrative, and Game of the Year, all major categories Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was nominated in. The loss of those first two elicited a 'This is fine' meme post, but Game of the Year followed with the killing blow. Kingdom Come's social account responded to that disappointment with a perfect dialogue option from KCD1. ggwp @expedition33 😉 pic.twitter.com/ZPl55G1CW4 December 12, 2025 They really did have their memes prepared for the moment—I'm now wondering what they would've posted if Hollow Knight: Silksong had nabbed the top prize.

Instead of a big, exclamation-point 'one more thing!' —the prophesied return of Gabe Newell, striding onto center stage with three fingers held high—host Geoff Keighley closed the show with a reveal of a brand new game from an unknown studio: A PvP raid shooter called Highguard. Which isn't to say Highguard wasn't hyped up to infinity before the trailer dropped. After a stage-spanning flight across stormy seas and rocky shores, Keighley did what he does and put the pedal to the metal with both feet. \"Sometimes our last reveal at the Game Awards is a teaser for something years and years away. But not tonight,\" Keighley pronounced with dramatic purpose. \"Our final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that built Apex Legends and Titanfall. Four years ago, the principals founded a new independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter genre forward with a new original game. They've done it in complete secrecy, which is even more amazing because the game is very deep into development. \"The power of independent, self-published studios to push this medium forward is a growing, and I think, positive theme in our industry. …",

It's a game that would be well-served by a remake, in other words—something that had the time necessary to give the original's vision the attention it deserved. Turns out, just such a remake was—perhaps is —notionally in the making. That's according to Game File's recent scoop on Aspyr's ill-fated attempt to get The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (the popular mod that restores a lot of cut-but-still-on-disc content to the game) onto the Nintendo Switch. More on those efforts later. Court filings from the now-settled gamer's lawsuit against Aspyr —initiated by a fan upset at the studio's \"false advertising\" of TSLRCM on Switch—have revealed the existence of project Juliet.

The studio releases a short, cinematic teaser with an emphasis on body horror—the ceremorphosis of an unwitting guard rendered in horrible, gory detail. Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh. But on the whole, Baldur's Gate 3 is a bright heroic fantasy with bloody dark spots—it's a colourful, lively game that (unless you kill everybody) is about troubled people overcoming their worst nature and horrifying fates to save the realm. The body horror in that original trailer is a theme, but it's on…",

Specifically, Altman signs his latest blog post off with these comments: \"Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I’m really proud of the trajectory the team has us on. We are seeing tremendous benefits in what people are doing with the technology already today, and we know there is much more coming over the next couple of years.\" It may seem convenient, trite, and not a little facetious to use PC gaming as a prism through which to view OpenAI. But it's actually a pretty handy starting point, not least because this is such a massive, unwieldy topic. So, anything that breaks it down into manageable chunks is very useful.

Or so I thought… Earlier this year, Nvidia pulled support for 32-bit CUDA applications with its newest generation graphics cards, the RTX 50 series. With it gone, it's no longer possible to natively run 32-bit games with hardware-accelerated PhysX effects. Why that matters: PhysX offers a way to run some in-game physics calculations on an add-in card . That not only frees up the CPU to focus on other things, it also allows developers to put a lot more physics-based effects into their games. As such, games with PhysX effects tend to have a lot of stuff going on. If you run a game with PhysX enabled but without the hardware to accelerate it then all of the physics calculations fall on your CPU. Even on today's much faster processors, with many more cores than those around during PhysX's peak, the impact of these added effects severely limits frame rate. The CPU becomes a bottleneck. Or you turn PhysX off. Now, I'll admit, I hadn't thought about Ph…",

But now the community has decided that Arc Raiders has a different kind of matchmaking. I've dubbed it 'aggression-based matchmaking', and it's the phenomenon that players have noticed for quite some time now, where those who don't engage in PvP get put in chill lobbies, whereas players who shoot on sight get placed in super aggressive lobbies. (Image credit: Embark) I first noticed this a few weeks ago. For the most part, I had been very chill in solo lobbies, just going in to loot or even team up with strangers to take down bigger arcs. It was a great experience, and the sense of camaraderie here was unmatched. But then, on one fateful day, I decided to shoot someone in a solo lobby. I ended up killing them, and my fate was sealed. From here on out, everything changed. I'd get shot in the back of the head before I even clocked another raider.

You heard it here first: AMD $AMD is planning to use Intel $INTC foundry to manufacture chips in the USA (not just packaging). During my job listing research, I uncovered a job listing posted by AMD that mentions Intel’s “PowerVia” under preferred experience… This is HUGE! pic.twitter.com/BSZgjadWDO December 12, 2025 For sure, the Intel connection is clear enough. \"PowerVia\" is Intel's branding for what's known more generically in the chip-making industry as backside power . In the simplest terms, it's a new technology that involves moving the power delivery networks in chips below the transistors. It's claimed to result in faster and more efficient chips. What's more, PowerVia is being introduced on Intel's upcoming Intel 18A node . Put all that together with Intel's stated desire to make chips for all comers on its new process nodes, the fact that \"taping out\"…",

TerraUSD was a so-called stablecoin for its intrinsic tie to the value of the US dollar. Intended to always be valued at $1 per coin, the foundations of the stablecoin were complex and shaky. It relied on protocols, a separate counter-token called Luna, and an exchange for burning/minting tokens to maintain the price of TerraUSD at $1. Failed attempts to prop up the system and mislead investors using secret funds eventually led to the collapse of both TerraUSD and Luna, from $1 and $87 on May 5, to $0.2 and $0.00005 on May 13 . \"In fact, core Terraform products did not work as Kwon advertised and were manipulated to create the illusion of a functioning and decentralized financial syste…",

The trailer features VO from (presumably) some manner of fucko alien complaining about how namby pamby, politically correct, Empire-era emissions and engine size standards ruined speeder racing. But now with the antiwoke New Republic and its gutting of the relevant regulatory bodies, we're returning to \"massive engine, lightning fast, lives on the line\" speeder races. Speeder racing's inevitable reckoning with driver mortality aside, the racing in question looks sick as hell, with a real sense of speed and great use of scenic Star Wars vistas throughout the trailer. I mean, your graphics are certainly pretty enough: Get the handling right, and bing bang boom, that's a Star Wars racing game I'd play.

Conversations spanning multiple languages, yet everyone seems to understand each other? Teams of three, not unlike a certain King of Fighters? Turns out my vibes were not misplaced, if chatting with game director Federico Cardini is anything to go by. Milestone's \"love of Japanese animation and fighting games\" did a lot of heavy lifting in influencing Screamer's story and overall tone. \"I am personally a Street Fighter player,\" Cardini tells me. \"Our creative director, Michele [Caletti], is a super fan of King of Fighters.

The new Screamer—set to launch next year—has a very different vibe to its '90s predecessors. Peeled away from more realistic pastures for a neon-lit anime bonanza, heavily-modded cars and the unusual decision to put narrative at the centre of its arcade racing. On paper, it looks wildly unlike the games that came before it. But as Game Director Federico Cardini tells me, Milestone hasn't forgotten its roots. I asked about some of the more negative reaction to the revival, namely from people who played the originals and weren't happy with the new direction. \"I completely understand their opinion,\" Cardini said. \"It's something we ourselves struggled with at the very beginning.

If all you know about Warframe is that it's a game with space ninjas, the relentless Wagnerian intensity of a Herzog monologue might feel like a strange fit. But Warframe is beautifully, uncannily strange. As Herzog says during the magnificent work of advertising, Warframe is a story about beings \"cursed to walk this senseless universe in living metal, haunted by dreams.\" Warframes are an open question about identity, humanity, and utility. They are a riddle cast in razor iron and warped, quivering meat. They are weapons 3D printed from muscle memory, psychic imprint, and arcane force. They can get pregnant.

I spoke to Neon Giant heads Arcade Berg and Tor Frick again last week, and can add a little more context to the trailer. The gameplay we see in the video reminds me of Bulletstorm—big kicks, exploding heads, lots of shooting—but we also spy some sneaky assassinations, so it isn't entirely about blowing stuff up. The studio is calling No Law a \"first-person open world shooter RPG.\" \"You have experience points and skill trees, and you opt into how you want to play the game,\" said Berg. \"Do you want to be more into lockpicking, or do you want to be a hacker, or do you want to be a specialist with certain types of weapons … We never tell you which route to take, we say that the player can…",

Forest 3's trailer begins with a first person view of a starship cockpit before something goes horribly awry and we careen impossibly far away from Earth at breakneck speeds. With the help of a cheeky little shoulder arm, our protagonist proceeds to do survival game stuff: Hunting, gathering, but no tree punching, which is a welcome relief. The sci-fi vibe really has me intrigued: The planet's swampy and foreboding, with that grey-blue, clammy, soaked-through on a rainy day look of Death Stranding.

Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis promises a \"stunning re-imagining\" of Lara Croft's first adventure from nearly 30 years ago, with updates graphics and gameplay, and \"new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.\" Narratively at least, the remake seems to be treated as sort of a recollection of years past, which presumably opens the door to previously unseen events and action. The announcement also finally gives us our first live look at the \"Unified Lara\" character design revealed in early 2024, a blend of the OG and her more modern look, last seen in 2018. This will be the second remake of the original Tomb Raider, following the serviceable but largely unremarkable Tomb Raider: Anniversary . But that was 18 years ago, and I'd say that's more than enough time passed to allow for a new shot at it. The bigger deal, though, is Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Set in northern India, Catalyst follows Lara on an all-new adventure that takes place in the aftermath of a \"…",

So we probably shouldn't be surprised to discover that its new Control sequel, announced at The Game Awards tonight, swerves on pretty much everything you'd think would carry over from the first game. To break it down: It's not a third-person shooter—it's a melee-focused \"action-RPG\". It's not set in the Oldest House, but instead an open world New York. It doesn't star Jesse Faden—you play as her brother, Dylan, who was the first game's villain. Perhaps appropriate, then, that it's not called Control 2—it's Control Resonant—though it does seem to follow on from the events of the first game. Dylan, seemingly now free of the influence of the Hiss, has been deployed by the FBC to combat a new supernatural disaster—namely, reality-warping forces that have spilled out of the Oldest House and into the outside world, twisting an entire city into new forms. Where Jesse wielded the Service Weapon, able to transform into a variety of different guns, Dylan instead has the Aberrant, an artifact that frankly looks like a cursed crowbar. It too can shapeshift, but into a selection of melee weapons, including an enormous…",

Kennedy surprise in Resident Evil Requiem was spoiled earlier this week, but now we've got a proper look at the young (well, young-looking, isn't he like 50 now?) lad in action thanks to a new trailer unveiled tonight at The Game Awards. The trailer showcased large, angry, heavily bespectacled bad guy Victor Gideon, apparently a once-respected doctor who sure seems to be having a rough time of things more recently. The big twist, though, is the appearance of Leon as a playable character: Until now, Capcom has insisted that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, but it seems that Leon will be playing a significant role as well. But not the same kind of role as Grace: She will center on Resident Evil: Requiem's survival horror gameplay, while Leon will be all about the \"explosive action.\" And hoo boy does it look good: The trailer showed a brief snippet of over the shoulder shooting, as well as some of Leon's signature melee combos: That roundhouse kick fired off deeply buried synapses in my brain. In a delightful twist, after getting chased by another big guy with a chainsaw again, Leon flips the script, steals it, and turns it on his enemies—no more Dr. Salvador …",
