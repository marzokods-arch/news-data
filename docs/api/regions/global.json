The report, which was conducted by real estate development strategy firm Hunden Partners, states that the District could be attracting significantly more business if the area had another hotel located near the recently renovated Baird Center – specifically in the location where the Miller High Life Theatre stands. According to the proposal, the theater – which is owned by the WCD and operated by independent promoter Pabst Theater Group – was recommended for demolition because it will be &#8220;threatened with the new Live Nation venue” that is currently being built nearby on the same campus as the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks arena, Fiserv Forum.

In addition to solar and battery-based backup, the SOLIX E10 also supports a fuel-based Smart Generator that can run on gasoline, natural gas, or propane. The multiple systems can offer a combined power output of 90kW. As part of its CES 2026 showcase, Anker’s sub-brand SOLIX gave us a preview of its new integrated home backup solution, the SOLIX E10. Following that early look last month, nationwide sales of the E10 platform are opening today. SOLIX says the E10 is the world’s first “smart hybrid whole home backup system.” While the other bits are self-explanatory, hybrid here refers to its ability to run on multiple fuel options. In addition to its support for solar power and a battery-based backup solution , the E10 also supports traditional fuels such as propane, gasoline, and natural gas through the SOLIX Smart Generator 5500, which can be effective in scenarios with prolonged outages and scant sunlight.",

Acer announced the Acer 4K UHD Google TV Streaming Box in South Africa late last year, and this looked like the answer to my prayers. This Google TV box is made by prominent ODM SEI Robotics, but a closer look revealed that it easily met my requirement for more ports. This theoretically means I can plug in my portable hard drive for no-frills local media playback, or easily plug in a flash drive to transfer APKs. I recently splashed out on the Acer TV box and, after using it for roughly six weeks, here are my thoughts on making the switch.",

New evidence from the IMEI database suggests Samsung is preparing a dedicated variant for the US. The finding follows previous reports that Samsung plans to produce a million units of the Wide Fold, higher than any previous special edition foldable. Apple is bringing its first foldable to the market this year, and other brands are taking notes. The iPhone Fold is set to depart from the accepted book-style design and instead opt for a wider layout, similar to the first Pixel Fold or the Microsoft Surface Duo. Even before the launch of the iPhone Fold, many Android manufacturers were exploring new or additional foldables with similarly wide inner displays, and Samsung is among them . In addition to the Galaxy Z Fold 8 this year, Samsung is expected to launch a “Wide” Fold, and new evidence suggests it might be available in multiple markets worldwide, including the US. The assumption is based on a recent listing of a mysterious Samsung foldable , which was spotted on the IMEI database in December 2025. The said entry has now been updated (via SmartPrix ) with…",

While these may be the initial applications, we could see more, as previewed by Google in its Project Astra demo last year. Google could refer to the functionality as “screen automation.” AI agents are the hottest trend in tech , and the increasing momentum leaves no room for doubting that your mobile devices will soon be controlled by them. Back at I/O 2025, Google demonstrated how it plans to put Gemini in charge of controlling your phone for you. This was dubbed Project Astra and showed Gemini’s capabilities at not just viewing the text and media on your phone, but also scrolling and tapping when needed, basically displaying a spectrum of agentic force in action to help you with simple tasks.

Plex is the most popular app for watching stored content over a local network, but JellyFin has also emerged as a great alternative over the years. JellyFin isn’t available on Samsung TVs, though, but we’ve finally got some good news. A user on JellyFin’s GitHub repository (h/t: Linuxiac and XDA-Developers ) noticed that the media server app was now available on the Tizen app store for Samsung TVs. Another user followed up by posting a photo of JellyFin installed on their Samsung TV, as seen below.",

How many smartphone brands will be left by the end of 2026? We are living in what feels like a dangerous time to be a smartphone company, with manufacturers either closing up shop , backing away from flagships , or denying reports of business trouble . It’s almost enough to make you think there won’t be anyone left but Samsung and Apple before you know it. And as we wait to see what fate has in store for these companies, we’re getting some small reassurance that at least one minor player intends to keep going with new phones.

A new Personal Intelligence toggle lets you stop Gemini from using connected app data in that chat. The update follows previous sightings of Labs behind the scenes and appears to be currently limited to the Gemini web app in select regions. Google Labs and Search Labs have long been used by Google as a way to give users early access to features that aren’t quite finished. With Gemini evolving so quickly, it always felt like only a matter of time before it got the same treatment. Right on cue, Gemini Labs has finally made an appearance, after we spotted signs of it approaching behind the scenes in recent months. As 9to5Google spotted, Google has started surfacing a dedicated Labs section inside the Gemini web app, giving experimental features a clearly marked home instead of mixing them in with everything else. The Labs area lives inside Gemini’s Tools menu and is marked with the familiar Google beaker icon. It groups together features that are still actively being developed, such as Agent and Dynamic view, making it clear what’…",

Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears. Navigation still works, but there’s no visual indicator of the car’s actual location. Force-quitting Maps on the phone brings the icon back for the user, but only until the next time i…",

There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose.

This comes after the Galaxy Z Fold 7 reportedly outsold the Galaxy Z Flip 8 last year, despite Samsung originally planning to make more Flips. Samsung traditionally produces more Flip phones than Fold devices in a given year, as Flip foldables are significantly cheaper and tend to see more demand. However, it sounds like Samsung is planning to flip (heh) the script in 2026. Korean outlet ET News reports that Samsung plans to produce more Galaxy Z Fold 8 units than Galaxy Z Flip 8 devices this year. The website, citing industry sources, says Samsung will make 3.5 million Galaxy Z Fold 8 devices in 2026 versus 2.5 to 3 million Z Flip 8 units.",

The earbuds are likely to feature a practical, stable design to avoid the Galaxy Buds 3’s quality issues. The Buds 4 series might also cost the same as the Buds 3 did at launch. Unlike its smartphones, Samsung refreshes its flagship earbuds once every two years. That means the successor to the Galaxy Buds 3 series should launch sometime this year. While Samsung typically launches earbuds alongside its foldables at mid-year, it may release the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro earlier than usual, alongside the Galaxy S26 series later this month. And, the chief focus for these flagship earbuds would be reliability. According to industry sources cited by Korea’s ET News , Samsung’s efforts with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 series aim to regain consumer trust.

Well, at least outside of T-Mobile’s most ardent fans. Yet, here we are at the beginning of 2026, and slowly but surely we seem to be heading in this direction. In 2025, T-Mobile won several awards from major survey companies, including Ookla, and largely became known as the king of network speed . Even AT&amp;T is finally striking harder at the competition , particularly T-Mobile.",

Google has been in overdrive, trying to integrate Gemini and its AI capabilities into all its apps and services. Google Maps has also received its fair share, including the recent Gemini-powered upgrade to walking and cycling navigation .

Credit: Tom Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR The Nothing Headphone (a) is reportedly launching on March 12, with pre-orders starting around March 5. It is rumored to cost €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is roughly half of the Headphone 1. The leak suggests four color options: black, white, pink, and yellow. Nothing is reportedly about to break the premium-only mold it set with the Headphone 1 . After turning heads with its transparent-design over-ears and solid feature set last year, the brand is now said to be readying a more affordable sibling, and the pricing could surprise you. A new report from Dealabs says the launch is set for March 12, 2026, with pre-orders starting around March 5 (via Notebookcheck ). The big news is the expected price: about €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is about half of what the original Headphone 1 cost at launch. This price drop puts Nothing in direct competition with mid-range headphones from brands like JBL and Sony, which is unexpected for a company known for its premium look and pricing.",

We’re heading closer to the official Galaxy S26 series unveiling later this month.

While the overall designs of the new Galaxy S26 phones have broken cover multiple times, leaks around other tidbits are gaining momentum. And today, we’re looking at the Galaxy S26 Ultra in the different color options. The leak comes from Russian retailer Cifrus.ru , which appears to have listed the Galaxy S26 Ultra in different colors. Although the listings have since been removed, SammyGuru obtained images of Galaxy S26 Ultra renders in various colors.",

As the two parties failed to reach an agreement before the then-existing licensing deal expired, a Disney media blackout ensued. Although both corporations were predicted to lose millions during the blackout, the situation wasn’t resolved until mid-November . Now we’re starting to learn just how big a financial impact that blackout had on Disney. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The update adds new Google Home automation starters and conditions, including humidity levels and robot vacuum docking. You can now trigger more detailed actions in automations, such as setting smart lights to specific colors or temperatures. New features are all well and good, but most Google Home users would just settle for the basics working smoothly . Against that backdrop, Google’s latest Home app update isn’t anything monumental, but it does tackle a frustration many camera owners will instantly recognize, and brings a bunch of extra automations and starters for the smart home power users. In a new Google Home changelog today , the company says it has improved “close-to-live playback” for cameras in the Google Home app. That means the app should now be much better at playing back clips that were recorded moments ago, reducing those all-too-familiar “Video not available” errors when you tap a notification or open a recent event.",

But last year, Android users found themselves scratching their heads about one change in particular: Google’s Phone app adding support for a landscape-style interface . Was it a bug?

She loves it too, especially after it recently got a surprise Android OS update beyond its promised allocation. I’d certainly miss OnePlus if it left the Android smartphone market, but I assumed you might be more split on your level of support for the brand. According to our poll, I may have assumed wrong. As those of you with your finger on the pulse will be aware, we didn’t ask this question as a pure hypothetical. A surprising report last month claimed that OnePlus may be winding down its smartphone operation, and we polled you on your feelings about it in our coverage. OnePlus has since dismissed the report as false, so it might be nothing, but my colleague Joe Maring argued that losing OnePlus would be bad for Android and the US smartphone industry as a whole. The crux of his argument in his subsequent article was that, like it or not, the OEM often leads the way with innovations that push its rivals, and that competition in such a huge tech field is generally a good thing.

International models are tipped to get a 6,000mAh battery, while China gets a much larger 6,800mAh cell. Global buyers may also get fewer color options, missing out on China’s exclusive light purple variant. If you were expecting the global Xiaomi 17 Ultra to be a no-compromise flagship, here’s a reality check. It looks like it will be expensive and a bit less feature-packed than the version sold only in China. A recent leak on X from Arsène Lupin says the upcoming Xiaomi flagship will cost €1,499 in Europe for the 16GB RAM and 512GB storage model. That puts it in the same ultra-premium range as top Samsung and Apple phones.",
