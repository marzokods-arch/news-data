Trials provides more challenges for players to complete during excursions, like damaging Hornets, searching new wave husks, or destroying Ticks, Fireballs, and Pops, alongside the quests that different raiders from Speranza give you. For each challenge, there are three milestones at 1,000 points, 2,500 points, and 4,000 points, and each milestone will reward you with a better mystery prize. (Image credit: Embark Studios) At first, I thought that these were easier quests that I could simply tick off my to-do list without thinking too much about it, and while challenges at the lower levels aren't too difficult, it often takes a dedicated run to complete them. This is because you don't gather progress over multiple runs, you have to complete the challenge in one go. \"Raider Trials have raised a few questions, so here's the 101,\" an official Arc Raiders social media post says. \"Progress only counts per single sur…",

But that's where my heart immediately sank when I logged in to check the new store bundles—the first store refresh since launch. That new Scrappy diving helmet added in the new Deep Sea Bird set costs 900 raider tokens, and includes the Scrappy outfit, an emote, and a little charm. Thankfully, all of these items can also be purchased individually, but the cool helmet costs 700 tokens by itself.

In the case of the latter, these can be nothing more than a statement of the blindingly obvious, but occasionally, something gets dropped that's just wild . The recent claim that Nvidia will cancel its forthcoming GeForce RTX 50 Super series due to memory shortages is a prime example. As reported by Uniko's Hardware on X , someone, somewhere, is claiming that the DDR4/DDR5 memory shortages will make the cost of 3 GB GDDR7 modules so high that Nvidia is going to cancel the refresh of RTX 50 graphics cards, which are expected to use the larger RAM chips . Oh, and the current cards will get a lot more expensive for good measure, too. [rumor]due to the crazy shortage recently, 3gb gddr7 cant make it to the consumer market for desktop, thus the super series is cancelled.and the current models are expected to be more expensive very soon, because of the increasing cost of 2gb gddr7. pic.twitter.com/yMSMj1MjqJ November 7, 2025 There's little point in asking Nvidia directly about this because it will always just say things …",

Since the Refiner is used to craft certain higher-quality upgrade materials, like advanced mechanical and electrical components, levelling this station up should be a priority early on. For the level two Refiner, you'll not only need three toasters, but also five Arc motion cores and eight fireball burners . Luckily, the latter two are found on Arc machines—fireball burners specifically from Fireball Arcs, of course. Toasters, however, aren't so simple to track down. Where to find toasters in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) The best place to find toasters is the Village in the northwest corner of the Blue Gate map . Since this area is Commercial and Residential, there's a high chance of finding everyday technology like toasters inside the houses, whether that's loose on the kitchen countertops or inside cupboards. Village is also a very large area with lots of ground to cover, so you're bound to find at least one, if not all three, in a single run. Plus, yo…",

Case in point: on Tuesday colony builder Generation Exile dropped on Steam to a total of three user reviews, despite a seasoned indie team behind it. Studio founder Nels Anderson was previously the lead designer of masterful stealth game Mark of the Ninja before co-founding Campo Santo to make Firewatch. Generation Exile's team also includes Karla Zimonja, designer on Gone Home and Tacoma, and Niamh Fitzgerald, lead designer of hit traffic sim Mini Motorways . Oh, and a soundtrack from FTL and Into the Breach composer Ben Prunty!? Maybe the problem is the Steam page doesn't mention that the game's got capybaras in it .

For studios planning a November 2026 launch, that nightmare became reality today when Take-Two announced a new delay . GTA 6 was originally slated to release on consoles in Fall 2025—around now!—before its initial delay to May 2026. If you look at the major games releasing in May 2026 as of now, you'll notice there's basically nothing because everything is shambling to escape Rockstar's orbit. And while it's true that May isn't usually a busy month for blockbuster game releases, in 2025 we saw Doom: The Dark Ages and Revenge of the Savage Planet hit PC, both of which would be cremated alive in a battle against GTA. Speaking anonymously to The Game Business on the announcement of GTA 6's first delay , the \"boss of one of the world's biggest game publishers\" admitted that Rockstar sucks a lot of money and time out of the market and that \"we don't want to be anywhere near that.\" Another anonymous s…",

It clarified a few basic things, like being able to buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance (and therefore with in-game gold via WoW tokens) and that it intends to keep the catalog small compared to what you can earn by playing the game. \"Housing items tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop,\" it says. \"Thematically important decor that players know and love will also not appear in the shop.\" Then it went on to explain why it's adding a premium currency in the first place, especially when it already sells mounts and cosmetics for real money values. In addition to providing \"appropriate financial protections for both parties\"—whatever that means—Blizzard says it's to help players purchase multiple items at once. \"As an example, you may want a full set of chairs to place around a dining table, multiple …",

I'm using arcane magic to peer into the future to gain some extremely important knowledge: will anyone visiting my pub tonight have a hankering to play darts? I've long been looking for a great fantasy game where instead of a brave adventurer I could just be a humble tavern keeper, and it's finally arrived—and appropriately enough, it's called Tavern Keeper . Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it. Tavern Keeper's tutorial is almost shockingly brief: after plopping you into a rundown pub in a gloomy swamp, you run through the basics of how to buy kegs of booze and serve them to customers, hire workers and assign them jobs, and order supplies that can be cooked into meals. But that tutorial is just the start of a learning process that hasn't ended even after eight hours of play. There's a to-do list to keep both your customers and staff satisfied, from managing room temperature and deco…",

I'm old enough to have used my dad's PC to play games a few years before we got a dial-up internet connection at home, but I'm still too young to have ever internalized what \"online\" meant before the world wide web. Reading a recent blog by longtime Windows developer Raymond Chen, I realized that when '80s computer geeks used the term, its meaning was completely flipped. \"The term 'online' originally meant 'immediately available on a computer,\" Chen wrote, explaining why Windows 3.0 (which was released in 1990) included WinHelp, a program built for browsing \"online\" help files.

The trailer in question is for update 18 of Crime Boss: Rockay City , and we might as well get this out of the way first: Yes, Crime Boss: Rockay City has had 18 updates since it launched in June 2024, yes it's still running, and yes, people are still playing it—not many people, no, but some. (More on this later.) Its continuing survival is notable because Rockay City brings a genuinely impressive cast of C-tier celebrities to the table—Michael Madsen, Chuck Norris, Michael Rooker, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, Kim Basinger, and Vanilla Ice—and yet is one of the most utterly mid-tier, 'why did they make this' videogames ever.

Say hello, then, to the Minisforum MS-R1 (via PC Watch ), a compact PC with an Arm chip and a full-sized x16 PCIe graphics slot. Game over for x86? Not so fast. For starters, the Minisforum MS-R1 runs a Cixin P1 CPU . It's a Chinese made chip built on 6 nm technology and configured with eight Cortex A720 performance and four Cortex A520 efficiency cores. In other words, we're talking off-the-shelf Arm cores first introduced in 2023 and part of Arm's mid-range Cortex A700 range, which is more about efficient mobility than outright performance. Arm's Cortex X900 series and, soon, the C1 Ultra, represent Arm's most performant cores of the moment. This is also a compact machine. So, even with that full physical x16 graphics slot, you're not going to be fitting an RTX 5090. Even a mid-range GPU probably won't fit. The slot is also limited to eight PCIe Gen 4 lanes, electrically, which is arguably suboptimal, even if, in reality, that's u…",

That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm.

RDR bucked that expectation when it straight-up killed poor ol' John Marston at the end. Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish.

While it's far from ideal for casual players who simply want to reset their tree, the Expedition Project is a smart approach to the controversial wipes mechanics of other extraction shooters. For the unaware, the Expeditions system is basically Arc Raiders' answer to hardcore players asking for regular account wipes. It's voluntary, unlike in Escape from Tarkov, but it'll reset pretty much all of your progression and effectively retire your character, letting you create a new raider and start from scratch every eight or so weeks. It's like prestige mode in Call of Duty.

What actually happened was that the game sold pretty well as an entertaining open world romp, and we all moved on with our lives. In other words, Ubisoft made an Ubisoft game . Nothing exploded because a Black samurai was in it. Gaming survived. Part of why Shadows' release was uneventful was, in part, because of Ubisoft's sudden pivot to, essentially, ' stop feeding the trolls .'

No, it wasn't the whiskey playing tricks on me, it was instead another gift from my mischievous editor-in-chief. This time he's sent me a $23 Amazon Basics USB condenser microphone to review. Goody. Actually, I shouldn't be so quick to judge. Pulling the mic from its default cardboard packaging reveals a surprisingly weighty little chassis, and that's a promising start. I've had the privilege of working with some roadworthy audio equipment over the years, and the little Amazon Basics mic has the same sort of heft I'd usually associate with something gig-proof, like a Shure SM58 or SM57.

Kjellberg explains that instead of asking Google or querying ChatGPT things like, 'who would be the best creator to collaborate with next,' he instead consults his AI council.

Is it even a full graphics card, or just a CPU cooler attached to some kind of board beneath? We may never know. Personally, I'm guessing the latter. While the cooler checks out as matching the Astral RTX 5080, there's no end bracket.

The upshot of which is that while PC memory prices look unappealing right now, there's almost certainly worse to come. In really simple terms, there's a lag between spot pricing—which is the price DDR5 memory kit makers pay for DDR5 memory chips—and what we poor PC fans have to pay for actual memory kits. In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices.

But like clockwork, there are two more heroes ready to tussle for the next spot on the roster, as two new X-Men have been spotted in the patch notes. Ok, they're not exactly in the patch notes, but it's close enough: Gambit and Rogue have both been sighted in the background of the hero image for the latest update. I'm so used to seeing Black Panther's recognisable silhouette that I almost didn't notice this sneaky change for version 2025/11/06, but after closer inspection of Marvel Rivals' home news page , I can safely say that it's the iconic duo. ‼️GAMBIT AND ROGUE FIRST LOOKNew heroes coming to Rivals Season 5 was spotted by @mmmmmmmmiller in the patch notes background, and thanks to @badguyjohn they've made a clearer version of the two heroes. pic.twitter.com/BxF11HgMPC November 5, 2025 Marvel Rivals Season 4 is about to wrap up next week on November 14, so it's a good time to start soft-launching the next hero.

With that said, much like a lot of the challenges in Peak, it is slightly luck-dependent as there's no guarantee the item you need will spawn. It's much easier to tackle this badge when you're playing with multiple people, too, but only one of you will be able to earn the Competitive Eating badge at a time, which is worth keeping in mind. Here's what you need to do. How to get the Competitive Eating badge in Peak To unlock the Competitive Eating badge, you need to eat three hot dogs in five seconds or less . As always, it sounds a lot easier on paper than it actually is in practice, as hot dogs don't appear in luggage like the majority of other food items. Instead, there's only one place you can find them during your climb, and even then, you've got a 50/50 chance of one appearing. Hot dogs will only spawn around the campfire in each biome , and even then, there's still a chance you may spawn a marshmallow instead. You'll also only get one item, be it a marshmallow or a hot dog, per player. So, it's a lo…",

But with how many edible items there are in the Roots biome, narrowing down which one may waste precious climbing time or risk you succumbing to the fog.
