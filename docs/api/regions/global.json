It's a risky move for such a high-profile game to skip all the pre-release marketing hype entirely, but it paid off, and it's clear why Respawn went that route—\"photoreal PvP hero shooter\" was an eyeroll-inducing prospect even back in 2019, so letting the game speak for itself short-circuited any pre-release angst. We don't know if the strategy could have been replicated, but would it have been worse than the late Concord's legendary failure or the reaction to the recently announced Highguard, which was the final big reveal at last year's Game Awards ? Viewers expecting something like 2023's Monster Hunter Wilds reveal or the one-two Matrix Unreal Engine 5 tech demo and Matrix 4 trailer in 2021 have been taking out their frustrations on Highguard. The reveal was drowned out by hot takes calling out its \"Concord vibes\" and it received a ghastly 2,400 dislikes on YouTube compared to around 500 likes when it first dropped. There's been an assumption to some of the criticism that Highguard wanted this smoke, so to speak—an idea that if the Highguard studio hadn't splurged on such an exclusive spot, it wouldn't have earned all this ire.

He stood up for the game as public figures like Elon Musk derided it, and the day after Ubisoft announced his exit from the company, he said it wasn't his choice . Now, he's suing. When he originally spoke on the issue last October, he said on LinkedIn he was offered a role at the nascent Vantage Studios, but that \"it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.\" It was evident back then he was not enthusiastic about leaving, as he said \"I came to see myself as the captain of the Assassin’s Creed ship, someone who leaves only once every soul on board is safe. And that is exactly what I have done for as long as I could.\" Friday, Radio-Canada reported that a lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Quebec claiming $1.3 million in damages (just under a million in US currency), including two years' salary and $75,000 in moral damages.

But just as all life ends in death, all digital gaming commerce ends in a cut for GabeN. Last Friday, New Blood CEO Dave Oshry said on X that Blood West's free giveaway on the Epic Games Store was a boon for the game… on Steam, where it sold \"like 200% more\" that day. He was quote-reposting a meme with over 40,000 likes expressing the sentiment that a cheap game on Steam is preferable to a free game on EGS. In the thread, he elaborated: \"I used to think EGS was a Marketing Black Hole but turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!\" He added that console sales spiked, as well.

If you're a PC gamer, your cup runneth over so much that you may still be catching up on the year's biggest hits even now, and you're not alone. In fact, one industry analysis group reckons Dec. 2025 was Steam's highest-grossing December ever. That estimation comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics , which reported that last month saw over 100 million Steam users generate $1.6 billion dollars in gross revenue. That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history. The report explains \"that’s up 22.7% over December 2024 and even more than December 2020’s pandemic-driven high of $1.4 billion.\" The report also notes that Arc Raiders is the second-biggest breadwinner of the season⁠—the first is eternally Counter-Strike 2, as dictated by the laws of physics—with a staggering 1.2 million copies sold just in the weeks between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4. As the article puts it, \"the brakes are broken on the ARC Raiders train,\" with the game selling 12 million copies overall. 250,000 copies were apparently sold on Boxing Day alone, with almost 3.2 million players checking in and half of them…",

For dark fantasy RPG Lunacid , however, developer Kira LLC took inspiration from the Japanese studio's far lesser-known series King's Field, which first appeared on the PlayStation 1. Despite taking this leftfield approach, Lunacid proved a big hit, racking up a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam from over 7,000 Steam reviews . Indeed, Lunacid has been successful enough that it's getting some DLC, even though its creator, Kira, is confused about the game's success.

I definitely had too big a scope for it, but I have to complete it, even just for my sake.\" Kira points out that completing the DLC is currently her main project, briefly apologising for \"getting distracted by Halo modding.\" She doesn't provide an estimate for how long that additional 30% will take, but notes that the DLC's launch will coincide with \"a few more rounds of bug fixing that wil…",

That particular drop will include cards based on The Ghoul, Maximus, and Lucy, who gets her own card as well as appearing on Spirit Mantle (emerging from the Super Duper Mart in her armored vault suit), and Pre-War Formalwear (in the chaos of the cornfield on her wedding night). Max technically gets a second appearance as well, since that's him inside the T-60 Power Armor, which gets its own card as well. But it's not all TV tie-ins. There's also a batch of five New Vegas-themed cards, with Benny, Joshua Graham, The Platinum Chip, a Custom Caravan Deck, and a Sunset Sarsaparilla Machine all included.

If you'd like more of the latter experience, The Rot Below is probably the mod for you. Impressively, it's the first mod by TheCrowKnight, who says it contains \"A host of terrifying new enemies,\" as well as \"Three boss battles\" and \"over 350 professionally voice acted lines.\" Most of those voice lines presumably belong to the villainous lich Malkifer and a bard named Adabelle you'll be tasked with rescuing, though the credits also include \"The Undead Blacksmith\". The Rot Below also includes new magical items, including glowy enchanted swords, and conjuration spells that let you summon new undead servants. Maybe even some of the mushroom-headed skeletons who appear in the trailer.

It kicks off with a patch note containing the two most beautiful words in the English language: \"added dinosaurs.\" It's a good sign that the team has its priorities straight. But that's not all. There are some new character creation options, a slew of bug fixes including several crash fixes, and some balance changes addressing some fundamental-sounding problems: \"weapon attacks should now check for line of sight,\" for example. Some placeholder assets and animations have been traded for more polished ones, and \"cautious wildlife predators\" have been adjusted so that they don't attack you unless you give them a reason to.

No one was hurt, fortunately, but the trio of robbers brandished handguns and smashed open several display cases full of merchandise at the Poké Court on 13th Street. They stole what store owner Courtney Chin estimates is $100,000 in merchandise. The thieves remain at large. Now, I know what you're thinking. This crime, though unfortunate, is sort of novel and maybe even a little funny because a Pokémon store was robbed and not a bank or an art museum. That's why you're reading it on PC Gamer, after all.

The game's model for co-op, which was detailed in a lengthy explainer video from Moon Studios in Dec. 2025, is \"similar to how realms work in Minecraft, the only difference being you don't have to pay for a subscription.\" What that means is that rather than Dark Souls invasions, Diablo 4's quasi-MMO open world, or other ARPGs' multiplayer systems where a single player's save file is used, No Rest for the Wicked will distinguish between persistent multiplayer saves and offline single-player saves.

I think I just ate a compass. By that I mean a magnetic one, not a pointy one used to draw circles. I'm not stupid. I just can't see, you see, and when you can't see it's a lot harder to tell whether an object you just picked up might be edible. Hence, when I plucked a star-shaped object off a door and my inventory labelled it as \"food?\" as it does with everything, down it went, costing me two points of health and any chance of knowing where north is. Not that a compass would have been much use to me anyway, given the whole lack of vision thing. This would probably be the weirdest thing to happen in most games.

MMORPGs are monstrously complicated things—they run on huge, easily DDOSable servers, they have economies that can easily get knocked off the rails, are designed to run for decades, and require constant balancing and fine-tuning. If you work on an MMO, you are Sisyphus trying to get a boulder up a hill, except you also have a bunch of angry forum users calling you an idiot the whole way up. Part of my job is understanding these complicated machines, and as I look at games in 2026, I'm starting to notice a trend that's really come to a head in these past few years: The main existential threat to MMORPGs of the modern era is getting the dang difficulty right.

Both games are pretty good sneak-a-thons, worthy of respect simply for how seriously they take stealth. While Styx can technically fight enemies face to face, he is utterly terrible at it and will almost certainly get killed. Hence, evasion, trickery, and shanking guards in the back are the best ways to progress. Master of Shadows set the template for Cyanide, in which Styx embarks on a series of infiltration and assassination missions across extravagant fantasy locations.

The sequel, Brigador Killers, has been in development for ages, which surprised me as I assumed it was just Brigador on a larger scale. But Stellar Jockeys recently released some new footage of the game, which shows it is a very different affair from the original, almost like a mix of Syndicate and OG Grand Theft Auto. As it turns out, that isn't far off Stellar Jockeys' own summary of the experience, with the dev having previously described it as \"Hitman: Contracts meets GTA2\". The main difference is that Brigador was a dedicated mech shooter, whereas Brigador Killers lets players explore missions on foot.

Unfortunately, he's instantly lost control of his realm due to the invasion of robotic Terranoids that killed his father in the first instance. Naturally, Vvalek decides to take his frustration out on Earth, for reasons we'll presumably discover while playing. Like Size Five's previous game Lair of the Clockwork God , Earth Must Die is inspired primarily by the comedy point 'n' click adventure games of the '90s. But it boasts a much more modern animation style and an absolutely stellar voice cast that includes major video game voice actors and some serious British comedy talent.

Or if you used Claude to generate a few code snippets? Or if someone in marketing used ChatGPT to make a spreadsheet?\" It seems that Valve has also been contemplating these questions and has made a tweak to its AI disclosure form for developers. In its submission form, Valve now specifies that game publishers must disclose pre-made generative AI assets only when used in marketing materials or content that \"ships with your game, and is consumed by players.\" That's via a screenshot of the form shared by Simon Carless' GameDiscoverCo. In other words, Steam's disclosure requirement is not concerned with generative AI tools used behind the scenes for efficiency gains (presumably including coding helpers) or office work, but with things like final art, sound, and writin…",

There’s a whole list of contraband items that can place your base in danger, so it’s vital that you know what to confiscate. From day seven onwards, you'll need to prevent survivors from bringing weapons, drugs, and zombie body parts into the camp. On the surface, those are pretty straightforward instructions but there are a whole lot of items stuffed into survivor suitcases that aren't obviously safe or dangerous. To help, here’s a full run-through of all the contraband items in Quarantine Zone and what you should do with them. Remember not to confiscate zombie parts.

    "body": "All of the things you don't expect hackers to be able break into, it surely has to be a humble set of headphones, earbuds, or wireless speakers. However, if they happen to use a specific Bluetooth pairing technology from Google, then there is a possibility that someone could remotely control the device, tap into the microphone, or even track its location. The tech in question is Google's Fast Pair system, which allows compatible devices to connect super quickly (i.e. one tap and you're done). As reported by Wired , researchers at KU Leuven University in Belgium analysed a range of different audio devices and discovered that the Bluetooth protocols used were vulnerable to being remotely hacked. Rather than just your phone being hooked up to your spangly new headphones, somebody else could join the connection, entirely undetected. Once in, they could do something as innocent as change volume levels or, far more worryingly, listen to what the microphones are picking up. Worse still, if the device supports Google's Find Hub tracking network feature, the location could be monitored. As with all such vulnerabilities, there isn't just one hack, but a collection of techniques that can be …",

During the Cold Snap, raiders could also enjoy snowball fights while slowly dying of hypothermia. 95 million snowballs were thrown over the course of the Cold Snap, with 10,577 arcs being taken down by one, and 91 raiders getting knocked out by them, a surprisingly low number if I'm being honest.

Fallout co-creator Tim Cain explains the nine core types of missions you can be given, and, to my surprise, kill and murder are two separate categories. If you just want to know the nine kinds of quest, then here they are: murder, kill, the infamous fetch quest, collect, delivery, the often maligned escort quest, talk, puzzle, and timed. Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains. We all know what a fetch quest is—go here, get this item. A collect quest is different in the same way a kill quest is—gather a set amount of an item, like 20 nirnroot. A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person. An escort quest is similar, only you need to deliver a person instead of an item, so they're often trickier. All of The Last of Us can be considered one long escort quest. One that sounds obviou…",

While the former is faster and more robust, the latter offers considerably more storage, making it ideal for housing terabyte-hungry games. And if SK Hynix's developments with PLC chips come to fruition, we could see a return to sensible SSD prices. PLC or Penta-Level Cell flash chips aren't a new thing, as Intel, Toshiba, and SK Hynix all started working on their development a little over six years ago. Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable. Flash memory cells work by using a large voltage to effectively ram electric charge across an insulated gap. Once there, it can remain stored for very long periods of time before requiring a top-up. Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information. That only requires the voltage sensors with the flash chips to read one voltage, which is very quick and simple to do. However, because it's …",

Items are horribly balanced, and online matches are rife with players sandbagging and hoarding all the good items until the final stretch—that is, if you can even get to that point before the game throws an error at you and boots you back to the lobby. For a game that feels so heavily centred around its online competitive scene, it should be a dealbreaker. But Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hoists itself up with some of the cleanest, most robust kart racing I've seen on PC, tracks that leave a ton of room for experimentation and optimisation, vehicle customisation I could only dream of in other mascot-centric kart racers, and an abundance of unserious trash talk that feels so on-brand for the Sonic cast (Big: \"You look tense, buddy.

A collaboration between Capcom and luxury watchmaker Hamilton, the watches have been seen on the wrists of dual protagonists Grace and Leon in the trailers (though I can't say I especially noticed it because Leon was chainsawing a zombie doctor in half ). There are two models, only 2,000 will be made, and they will set you back a cool $1,475 for Grace's watch, and $2,175 for Leon's watch. Hamilton's descriptions of the watches are really something, the kind of thing only a very bored person who has nothing to do but sell watches would come up with. \"Grace wears a unique American Classic Pan Europ that blends strength and sophistication with a gold-accented strap, geometric case-back motifs, and a bold gold-and-black dial.\" Bold!
