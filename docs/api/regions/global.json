During an earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei told investors that while he cannot predict the semiconductor industry's long-term trajectory, he remains bullish on AI. TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth. \"All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it's starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that,\" Wei said during the call. \"So another question is 'can the semiconductor industry be good for 3, 4, 5 years in a row?'

As part of the preliminary investigation, NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation has asked Tesla for more information on the problem. This week, it told the automaker it could have a five-week extension on its homework. To be fair to Tesla, NHTSA has asked for a comprehensive amount of information : a list of every Tesla produced and sold or leased in the United States, including whether or not that car had FSD and which version; cumulative data on how many US Teslas have FSD and how often it's used; and a list of all the customer complaints, field reports, incident reports, lawsuits, and other data related to FSD ignoring traffic laws.

    "body": "It has been nearly 80 years since Ferrari unleashed its first V12-powered sports car upon the world with the 125 S. In 1947, its debut year, the 125 S secured Ferrari’s first-ever race victory for the automaker, along with five other wins in the 14 events it competed in that season.

    "body": "This post contains some mild spoilers, mostly from the beginning of the first episode. Today is a good day to watch television. That's because the first two episodes of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy hit the Paramount+ streaming service, becoming the newest addition to the long-running Star Trek franchise. It's set in the late 32nd century, 120 years after the burn that ended all warp travel, and with it, most of Starfleet in the process. Now that warp travel is once again possible—you'll have to watch Discovery's final three seasons for more on that—the Federation is putting itself back together, and that includes reopening Starfleet Academy. That means this show is about young people in space, like Caleb Mir (Sandro Rosta), who was separated from his mother by Starfleet as a child, 15 years earlier. Mir and his mother, played by Tatiana Maslany, were traveling with a pirate—Nus Braka, played by a scenery-chewing Paul Giamatti—who killed a Federation officer while stealing food for them. The first episode opens on Braka and the Mirs being apprehended by Starfleet. Despite her misgivings, Captain Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter) carries out her order to separate mother and child. She's to g…",

The early homecoming culminated in an on-target splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego at 12:41 am PST (08:41 UTC) inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The splashdown occurred minutes after the Dragon capsule streaked through the atmosphere along the California coastline, with sightings of Dragon's fiery trail reported from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Four parachutes opened to slow the capsule for the final descent. Zena Cardman, NASA's commander of the Crew-11 mission, radioed SpaceX mission control moments after splashdown: \"It feels good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams who got us there and back.\" Read full article Comments",

Trump declared early in his second term that independent agencies like the FTC may no longer operate independently from the White House, and FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson has backed Trump's claim of authority over historically independent agencies. The Supreme Court appears likely to approve Trump's firing of an FTC Democrat, giving him expanded power over the agency.

And while we can't infer anything about why people might choose not to install iOS 26, the conclusion being jumped to is that iPhone users are simply desperate to avoid the redesigned Liquid Glass user interface. The numbers do, in fact, look bad: Statcounter data for January suggests that the various versions of iOS 26 are running on just 16.6 percent of all devices, compared to around 70 percent for the various versions of iOS 18. The iOS 18.7 update alone—released at the same time as iOS 26.0 in September for people who wanted the security patches but weren't ready to step up to a brand-new OS—appears to be running on nearly one-third of all iOS devices. Those original reports were picked up and repeated because they tell a potentially interesting story of the \"huge if true\" variety: that users' aversion to the Liquid Glass design is so intense and widespread that it's actively keeping users away from the operating system.

    "body": "Pairing Bluetooth devices can be a pain, but Google Fast Pair makes it almost seamless. Unfortunately, it may also leave your headphones vulnerable to remote hacking. A team of security researchers from Belgium’s KU Leuven University has revealed a vulnerability dubbed WhisperPair that allows an attacker to hijack Fast Pair-enabled devices to spy on the owner. Fast Pair is widely used, and your device may be vulnerable even if you've never used a Google product. The bug affects more than a dozen devices from 10 manufacturers, including Sony, Nothing, JBL, OnePlus, and Google itself. Google has acknowledged the flaw and notified its partners of the danger, but it's up to these individual companies to create patches for their accessories. A full list of vulnerable devices is available on the project's website . The researchers say that it takes only a moment to gain control of a vulnerable Fast Pair device (a median of just 10 seconds) at ranges up to 14 meters. That's near the limit of the Bluetooth protocol and far enough that the target wouldn't notice anyone skulking around while they hack headphones. Read full article Comments",

While the specific reason for the \"Bully Online\" takedown hasn't been publicly discussed, a message posted by the developers to the project's now-defunct Discord server clarifies that \"this was not something we wanted.\" The Bully Online mod was spearheaded by Swegta, a Rockstar-focused YouTuber who formally announced the project in October as a mod that \"allows you and your friends to play minigames, role-play, compete in racing, fend off against NPCs, and much more.\" At the time of the announcement, Swegta said the mod was \"a project me and my team have been working on for a very long time\" and that early access in December would be limited to those who contributed at least $8 to a Ko-Fi account. When December actually rolled around, though, a message on Swegta.com ( archived ) suggested that the mod was being released freely as an open source project, with a registration page ( archived ) offering new accounts to anyone.

The deals mean that most major AI developers have now signed on to the foundation's Wikimedia Enterprise program, a commercial subsidiary that sells high-speed API access to Wikipedia's 65 million articles at higher speeds and volumes than the free public APIs provide. Wikipedia's content remains freely available under a Creative Commons license, but the Enterprise program charges for faster, higher-volume access to the data. The foundation did not disclose the financial terms of the deals. The new partners join Google, which signed a deal with Wikimedia Enterprise in 2022, as well as smaller companies like Ecosia, Nomic, Pleias, ProRata, and Reef Media. The revenue helps offset infrastructure costs for the nonprofit, which otherwise relies on small public donations while watching its content become a staple of training data for AI models.
