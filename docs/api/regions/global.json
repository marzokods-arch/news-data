I can&#8217;t stop listening! You are a true visionary!!! The high praise comes as Rosalía gears up to release the follow-up to 2022&#8217;s Motomami , which found her dipping into pop, reggaetón, hip-hop, electronic and other genres, landing the singer her first album to chart on the Billboard 200, where it peaked at No. 33.

That network covers roughly half a million square miles of the US where normal cell service doesn’t reach.

Pricing and availability haven’t been announced, but it’s not going to be cheap. One of the most noteworthy shifts in Android gaming handhelds this year has been AYANEO moving away from ultra-premium handhelds with more affordable options like the KONKR Pocket FIT and Pocket AIR Mini, but its latest handheld throws all that to the wind to double down on complete, unnecessary luxury. First teased earlier this year, the company finally revealed the Pocket VERT earlier today in the YouTube video shown above. As promised, it’s a glamorous take on the Game Boy, with a CNC-machined body and “diamond-cut” shoulder buttons.

The device brings streaming, smart-home integration, and Dolby Audio to a budget-friendly package. It builds on Aurzen’s earlier D1R Cube projector with refined features and a lower price point. Aurzen’s earlier D1R Cube introduced Roku’s first projector integration and delivered 1080p resolution, Dolby Audio, and auto-focus and auto-keystone correction at a price of $249. The new EAZZE D1R keeps those hallmarks while adding broader smart-home compatibility, Apple AirPlay casting, and a lower $199 price tag.

I was surprised by the sheer amount of tech packed into something so tiny, and by the promises of powerful, continuous health tracking from a stylish ring that almost made me feel like I’d stepped into the future. Four months in, that’s where the honeymoon phase ended. The hard realities of current smart ring technology became impossible to ignore.

And when Apple rolled out its new Liquid Glass design language and I saw how horrid it looked on my devices, I swear I high-fived the air and said a small prayer of thanks for Material 3 Expressive . But there are some days when I’m still jealous, furious, and furiously jealous of Apple’s influence on the entire mobile ecosystem. See, not only did a few Android brands decide to adopt Liquid Glass-like influences in their own Android skins (I’m looking at you, vivo and Xiaomi), but more and more app developers are already adopting the design language in their iOS apps, too. Good for them, but hey, ho, hey, I’m here, waving my Material 3 Expressive Pixel. Can I also get some acknowledgment, please?",

Both companies have jointly filed the proposed settlement with the court. Under the proposal, Google will allow greater flexibility for developers to distribute apps and process payments outside of Google Play, thereby also expanding choices for Play Store users. Google and Epic Games may finally be close to ending their long-running legal dispute over the Play Store. Both companies have jointly filed a proposed settlement with the court, which could bring about big changes to how Android and Google Play operate.",

This naming split could help shoppers pick based on needs, but also risks confusing buyers who assume all “Gen 6” phones are equal. Qualcomm has just introduced its latest flagship chip, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 , and it’s already powering many upcoming Android heavy-hitters .

    "body": "TL;DR Apple is reportedly working on a lower-cost Mac laptop that could sell well under $1,000 by using iPhone-class chips and a smaller LCD. The project signals a strategic push to compete with Chromebooks and affordable Windows laptops, especially in education, where Apple currently trails rivals. If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.

It survived all durability tests, booted up afterward, and even includes oil in the coolant for a lava lamp visual effect. Some people might see a phone with visible coolant sloshing around inside it as an accident waiting to happen. However, Zack Nelson of JerryRigEverything proves that the new REDMAGIC 11 Pro is anything but, as he reveals the secrets to what he calls “the most powerful phone on the planet.” In his new video , Nelson dismantles what REDMAGIC calls the world’s first mass-produced liquid-cooled smartphone. The 11 Pro’s blue coolant can actually be seen circulating the back when the phone is switched on, pumped by a microscopic piezoelectric motor that pushes liquid through a sealed loop. The system works in tandem with a 24,000 RPM internal fan and what Nelson describes as the largest vapor chamber he’s ever seen in a phone.",

Telecom providers can exploit a hidden Android feature to show you an “inflated” signal strength. AT&amp;T and Verizon have already been spotted using this tactic. Telecom carriers often battle over broader coverage, the number of zip codes covered by 5G , and faster speeds. These claims, based on the carriers’ own marketing teams, paint a picture that’s far from the actual scenario and are often even contradicted in actual reports by independent parties . However, while it’s natural for corporations to paint a brighter picture, Google has been found colluding with carriers, allowing them to display fake signal strength on your phone. Beyond tall marketing claims and fake 5G icons , carriers may also be lying through their teeth to you about signal strength. A recent report by Nick vs Networking highlights a flag, KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL , in the source code for Android’s Carrier Config Manager, related to artificially “inflating” the network strength.",

    "body": "TL;DR German-based brand, Tolino, just launched the Tolino Flip, a Bluetooth remote for turning the company’s e-book pages. The device follows Kobo’s Remote, which debuted earlier this month with the same functionality. These releases highlight a growing interest in remote page-turners, something Amazon currently doesn’t offer. When it comes to e-reading , we’ve grown comfortable with the touchscreen tap or swipe. However, a new wave of add-ons, namely Bluetooth remotes that bring physical buttons back into play, is reshaping how we flip through digital pages. This week, German-based Tolino, a Rakuten Kobo subsidiary, joined that movement with the launch of its own remote control page turner, signaling that Kobo’s influence extends beyond its own lineup. The Tolino Flip connects to compatible Tolino e-readers via Bluetooth with a range of roughly 20 meters. Measuring about 10 cm long and weighing just 26.5 grams, it features an ergonomic design, two tactile buttons for forward and backward turns, and a removable wrist strap. The device runs on a single AAA battery, promising months of use, and comes in black or white finishes. It is available now for preorder from the Tolino websi…",

I say this because Samsung is the only manufacturer making Android devices that goes to the extent of remaking every menu and sub-menu, including even the highly ignored Digital Wellbeing dashboard. With its upcoming One UI 8.5 interface , Samsung could be taking a bold step towards reshaping the interface that has remained largely unchanged for the past two generations. Some of these changes are controversial and hold the potential to spark off a fresh iOS vs. Android comparison. But there’s one change that I wholeheartedly look forward to: a striking revamp of the Quick Settings panel . Based on the leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to adopt Android 16’s extensive customization options for Quick Settings — with an extra shot of newness . Even before the One UI 8.5 beta has been released, I’m genuinely rooting for this option to be a reality and feel it could be a dramatic improvement — beyond visual appeal — to the panel that One UI has seen in recent years.",

It recently announced that users will be able to uninstall pre-installed Meta apps, such as Facebook and Instagram, from their devices. This change will be introduced with the upcoming Nothing OS 4.0 beta update, scheduled for release by the end of the month. If there’s one peculiar characteristic of the Carl Pei-led tech brand Nothing, it’s the propensity for unusual choices and hot takes. The brand has consistently also maintained a strong stance on privacy. That is why its recent decision to include certain third-party apps on some of its phones from the factory sparked strong opposition from users. Now, it seems the brand is taking a half-step back and will allow users to delete some of these apps — but will continue to install them on some non-flagship phones.

Google’s Gemma large-language model was introduced as a next-gen AI companion inside its AI Studio platform, designed to support developers with text generation, creative drafts, summaries, and more. It represented Google’s broader push toward open experimentation with its advanced models, until everything hit a snag. Google has now quietly pulled Gemma from the public developer interface. First reported by TechCrunch , the move follows a formal letter to CEO Sundar Pichai from Senator Marsha Blackburn , a Republican from Tennessee, who said Gemma produced a fabricated allegation when prompted with: “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?”",
