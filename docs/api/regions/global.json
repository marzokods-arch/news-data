I suspect some rebalancing will follow these patches, but right now one miniboss has been hit with a super specific nerf and I'm glad of it: \"Fixed Phantom (Fields) being able to drain Life from your raised servants\". A couple of the minibosses in Hades 2 present as much challenge as the Guardians who act as each zone's bigger final boss, and the Phantom sure is one of them. This life-stealing mongrel heals after attacking you and isn't easy to dodge, especially when surrounded by allies and the flashy visual effects a typical fight in Hades 2 is accompanied by.

With Monster Hunter Stories 3, Capcom finally seems to be giving its RPG spin-off the scope and budget it deserves to really pop off. This light turn-based RPG series, which casts you as a young monstie rider instead of a monster hunter, didn't come to PC until last year, even though it debuted on the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. There was potential even then, but the YA story and rock-paper-scissors battle system seemed guided by the mistaken impression that the audience for Pokémon-likes is still first and foremost kids, and not the thirty/fortysomethings who grew up with them. In the 45 minutes of Monster Hunter Stories 3 that I played last week at TGS, it tried to distinguish itself from the jump.

Professional raiders and casual players alike have relied on combat addons to assist them with the MMO's endgame dungeons for decades. But starting in Midnight, they'll have to rely on the default UI and their knowledge of the fights. Wowhead attended a group interview with game director Ion Hazzikostas and UX designer Crash Reed where they were asked about addon support going forward. Hazzikostas didn't explicitly say when addons will go away, but his answers imply it will happen in the final patch before Midnight launches. Hazzikostas said a blog post for addon authors is coming \"in the next day or two\" that will explain how some combat information will be stored in a black box of sorts, preventing addons from accessing it. \"The UI and addons can know that box exists, they can display info…",

If the deal earns shareholder and regulator approval, it'll be the largest leveraged buyout in history—and it's already inspiring dread in fans and EA developers alike. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) To understand why the buyout news seems dire to so many, we first need to understand private equity and what exactly a leveraged buyout entails. The PIF, meanwhile, is its own troubling wildcard. Since 1990, EA has been a public company: Like other publicly traded businesses, its ownership—or equity—has been determined by the distribution of shares of capital stock that are bought and sold through stock exchanges. Being a publicly traded company offers advantages, the most obvious being the ability to raise funds by selling shares of stock.

As the developers at Square Enix have recently attested, pulling off the revival for PC and modern consoles has been no easy task, in part because the original source code no longer exists . In a new interview with PC Gamer at the Tokyo Game Show last week, director Kazutoyo Maehiro went into more detail about the specific challenges of adding a new PC-friendly interface to a game designed for the original PlayStation. \"I myself play a lot of games on PC, so … I was very particular making sure we got it right,\" Maehiro said. \"Tactics is a turn-based strategy RPG, so you might be playing it for a while. You'll spend a lot of time with your hands on the mouse and keyboard. One of the things I wanted to make sure was people wouldn't get tired from playing for extended periods of time.

Jayden Griffin, who is 19 years of age, was indicted by a grand jury in December 2024 over electronic communications sent to Epic Games staff between October 24, 2024, and November 9, 2024. Griffin pleaded guilty to \"threatening interstate commerce\", a charge brought because Epic Games is headquartered in North Carolina, and could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in federal prison, fined up to $250,000, or a combination of the two. Even should he avoid jail or get a minimal sentence, he faces up to three years of supervised release. Those are some potentially life-changing penalties, and should certainly give a certain breed of keyboard warrior pause for thought. A court document filed on September 16, 2025, contains the following statement from Griffin: \"I sent messages to Epic Games, where I threatened to kill employees of the company. I intended for the messages to be viewed as a threat at the time that I sent the messages.\" In a hearing on September 29 at the US District Court of South Dakota, Griffin entered…",

So I was pretty interested in Hotel Barcelona, a 2.5D action roguelite that emerged—like Athena from Zeus' skull—from a hot collabo between the two creators. And then I stopped being quite so interested: reviews weren't great—the game currently stands at a 56% Mixed user rating on Steam, and critics weren't in love with it either. Now, in another blow to my interest Hotel Barcelona has updated its Steam page to feature an AI disclaimer. The disclaimer bashfully admits that \"VHS tapes can be found in the late stages of the game that use voice overs from an AI text to speech service\" and that \"A logo is featured on these tapes that has utilised generative fill AI to complete the image.\" In an update published earlier today , Hotel Barcelona publisher CULT seemed pretty abashed by the wh…",

With the likes of TSMC (the world's largest semiconductor fabrication company) being based there, it's right at the centre of the global chip trade. With America also looking to regain a slice of that technological pie, that has led to some chatter about potential deals between the two countries. As reported by Reuters , US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told News Nation (a US-based television network) that it would be proposing a 50/50 split with Taiwan for future chip production. In this, the US government wants Taiwan to move 50% of the chips it produces for US use to be made in the US. TSMC has fabs in America, newly-built ones with plans for more, but they don't make up anywhere near as much of global production as its facilities in Taiwan. This proposed deal would try to push for commitment to a huge increase in production on US soil. Cheng Li-chiun, a Taiwanese politician and vice premier, told reporters, \"Our negotiating team has never made any commitment to a 50/50 split on chips.

As always, you'll need to complete a series of quests before you can invite them to stay with you, but you also need to have a lot already done before they even spawn in the realm in the first place. Before you start, you'll need the Beauty and the Beast realm already unlocked and both Belle and the Beast living in your valley . Once done, you'll receive a letter in your mailbox from the Beast regarding his friends, Cogsworth and Lumiere, at the castle. He wants you to go and check on them, and gives you some white rose petals too. Reading this letter will immediately begin the challenge of unlocking Cogsworth and Lumiere. How to complete the Haunting of the Beast's Castle quest First off, head to the Beauty and the Beast realm and walk straight to the library. The realm will look a lot different to what you're used to, with spiderwebs covering the walls and candles lighting the way. Lumiere will be standing by the fire when you enter the library, so speak to him. He will ask you to help him craft some fuel for the firepl…",

In place of that, it'll be adding its own increasingly-comprehensive suite of tools, such as a cooldown manager, buff tracker, and a more customisable personal resource bar. But one lingering thought has been rattling around in the back of my head: is Blizzard just swapping out one arms race for another? If we take Final Fantasy 14 , for example, user interface AddOns are completely against the terms of service—and in common enough use that they routinely scupper World First races . During a group interview in a recent summit for the expansion, I asked game director Ion Hazzikostas whether or not Blizzard was concerned about AddOn authors simply creating third-party tools that go against the terms of service anyway. After all, if you draw a line in the sand, there's gonna be people who walk over it. Hazzikostas was remarkably collected about the idea, though: \"We've approached this in a couple …",

I've written about the Asus x Hatsune Miku collaboration before, which already includes themed monitors, motherboards, and much more besides. Now, the range is set to expand and will soon offer a decidedly dear graphics card for sale; the new Hatsune Miku edition of the ROG Astral Geforce RTX 5080 O16G is apparently set to cost $1,900 (via Videocardz ). It's an eye-watering price tag, pitching up with a 90% markup over the MSRP of the standard RTX 5080 . Listen, I love the Vocaloid diva and I was fully expecting a Miku-Miku tax on this range—but that's a lot of money for a humble weeb like me.

Now you can try it for yourself—the game's first public demo is out on Steam now .

That means you can play through two levels in arcade mode—the streets of NYC and the SHIELD helicarrier—with nine playable characters, including favourites like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine. It's a pretty brief taste, but it gives you a great idea of what the final game is going to be like—and I recommend replaying the two levels a few times with different characters to see just how far developer Tribute Games has pushed the different movesets. From Venom warping into different grotesque forms to Rocket Raccoon throwing grenades all over the map, they all play completely differently—and frankly it's worth playing them all just to see all the gorgeous pixelart animations.

For a start, it's got such a neat integrated desktop stand, it's kind of astonishing to me that I haven't seen something like it before. Essentially, the SoloCast 2 comes as what appears to be one cylindrical unit with two boom arm screw mounts integrated into the bottom (⅜-inch and ⅝-inch, if you were wondering), making it seem like a standard, stand- less, microphone design. Break it apart like a shotgun breech, though, and it opens to reveal a hidden hinged base roughly one fifth of the way up its frame. It's a robust hinge, too, which means it's weighted enough in its movement to stay at exactly the angle you set it at in a desktop position, with plenty of mass at the bottom to prevent it from accidentally tipping over.

But perhaps most exciting of all—at least for me, whose attempts to play the mod at release were stymied by repeated crashes —is the promise of significantly improved \"stability, content, and overall player experience, addressing much of the feedback we've received since launch.\" It might just be time for me to hop back on the tube. …",

The trailer in question was itself made entirely in Sora 2, situating Altman in an AI-generated studio, an impossible neon-coloured forest, and even an oversized duck racing event. However, the most popular AI-generated clip on the Sora app right now is reportedly a fabricated surveillance video showing Sam Altman stealing graphics cards, according to OpenAI researcher Gabriel Petersson . The latest Sora model launched today alongside a dedicated app , with its key social pitch being features that allow you to remix your friends' creations and upload your own likeness into AI-generated videos.

Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not about that. 10 minutes into my roughly hour and a half playing the game at a recent event, I find myself agonising over which of 17 different possible designs of path I should lay down in front of my maintenance building. Each one has a fully customisable colour scheme. More than ever, this is a series about control . (Image credit: Frontier Developments) In that sense, this sequel feels aimed squarely at existing fans. The core loop is familiar to the point of, frankly, staleness—build enclosures, put dinosaurs in them, add and remove things until the dinosaurs are happy, plonk supporting buildings around them, repeat. Instead of shaking up the formula, what this sequel adds is more tools for refining, beautifying, and perfecting your park to your exact preferences. Buildings can be customised with a huge array of modular parts. The environment can be sculpted and shaped more elaborately than ever before. Almost everything can be recoloured, scaled, and rotated. \"…",

The staff of EA's myriad studios, who now have to wonder if their jobs are going under the guillotine to make Mohammed bin Salman and Jared Kushner's pocketbooks a little happier. With EA now on the hook for a $20 billion debt to JP Morgan in the wake of its leveraged buyout, frantic cost-cutting (and, joy of joys, AI ) seems inevitable. Especially worried are the staff at BioWare, which hasn't chalked up an unalloyed win since 2021's Mass Effect Legendary Edition and which hasn't chalked one up with an actually new game since 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. In a chat with Insider Gaming , anonymous staff at the RPG developer sound like they're just waiting for the axe to fall. \"I’ve been doing it since last year, but I’m making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,\" said one source, who added that it \"Kind of feels like a matter of time\" before things turn dark for the studio.

As always though, the first round of information includes some exciting additions the game can expect, but doesn't expose a lot of details like a release date. Luckily the official blog post about the drop, alongside the announcement at Minecraft Live 2025, has still given us plenty of information to dissect. As the title suggests, this update is all about adding new mounts to the game and a few items to improve the experience you currently have with mounts. As it stands, you're only able to ride horses, donkeys, mules, camels and pigs in Minecraft, so it'll be nice to shake things up and get new mounts to help you traverse open stretches of water as well as just land. Especially now you can craft a saddle. Here's everything we currently know about the Mounts of Mayhem update. When will the Mounts of Mayhem update be released in Minecraft? The Mounts of Mayhem update doesn't have a release date yet, and seeing as the Copper Age drop just launched, it will be a few months before we see the next update rolled out. With that said, this update has been referred to as the fourth drop of 2025, so…",

Especially if you have copper golems sorting out your base, or you've decorated floor to ceiling with various copper items. Luckily, it's not too challenging to gather as long as you've got the right tools and know where to look. A good way to start your hunt for honeycomb is by looking for bees, which spawn most frequently in meadow biomes. Venture to your nearest one, and you can start following them to their hive. But, you won't just be able to walk up to it and harvest honeycomb like you're using a chest. Here's what you need to do instead. Where to find honeycomb in Minecraft The key to gathering honeycombs is by locating a bee nest. But, rather than any old nest, you're looking for one that has already been pollinated and is filled with honey . This is indicated by the spots on the side of the hive, which are usually brown and dark, appearing golden and honey coloured. When you've found one, walk up to it and use shears, and up to three honeycombs will drop. Shearing a nest or hive will anger the bees inside…",

The clip (embedded above) shows Call of Duty pro Simp using one of Blops 7's new killstreak rewards, The Gravemaker, a sniper rifle whose wielder can see, and snipe, through solid walls. The go-to joke is that Activision has given up on combating cheaters and decided to just put wallhacking into the game. I sort of get the indignation, because it doesn't look fun to be on the receiving end of a bullet that was fired through two layers of concrete by someone you never could've seen, but I also sort of don't get it, because aren't all Call of Duty killstreaks like that?

How to craft bandages in 99 Nights in the Forest (Image credit: Grandma's Favourite Games / Roblox) You can craft bandages at the Anvil in 99 Nights in the Forest, though the crafting station may not look the same every time you play. Depending on your world and the current event, the map icon can be a different color and surrounded by alternative enemy types, but the principle is always the same. To craft a bandage , you'll need: Campfire Level 4 An upgraded axe or chainsaw (2) Rabbit's Foot (2) Wolf Pelt The Tool Workshop—a big, grey building marked with an anvil icon—typically houses the crafting station.

As cameras panned around the Las Vegas venue of COD Next, I tried and failed to identify anything real. There were the LED walls, which flanked attendees on all sides with larger-than-life Call of Duty logos. There were the hosts, overflowing with excitement for Black Ops 7's meager alterations to CoD's current form. There were the hyped creators in attendance, many of whose livelihoods are directly intertwined with the success of Call of Duty. And there was Black Ops 7 itself, a back-to-back sequel that not even its developers appear to feel strongly about. It was the pinnacle of videogame marketing excess: loud, abrasive, and insecure. Between extended ad reads for Little Caesars Pizza, AMD, Monster Energy, and Herman Miller chairs, we were treated to Black Ops 7 multiplayer with live commentary that fluctuated between 3 am infomercial and awkward riffing over gameplay that could easily be mistaken for the last handful of games. Much like Call of Duty itself in recent years, the stream had an air of importance and awe that didn't line up with our eyeballs. Developers took the…",

Crossroads of Ravens opens with our young hero, Geralt not-yet-of-Rivia, about to be punished for the crime of rescuing a peasant father and daughter. Multiple authorities take him to task for daring to play hero, all for entirely self-serving reasons, until an older witcher named Preston Holt steps in to save Geralt and position himself as the boy's new mentor. Crossroads of Ravens begins as it means to go on. Chapter two opens with a description of a peasant standing in fresh cowshit to keep his feet warm. It's a book about the mud and muck of its medieval world, one that jams its characters into moral quagmires as well as physical ones. It's a prequel to the Witcher series, set shortly after Geralt finishes his training at the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen under Vesemir and is let loose into the world. He's like a fresh-faced graduate right out of the education system suddenly having to deal with an adult world he isn't prepared for. Will he have to move into a moldy sharehouse and get a part-time job? Well, no. But he is going to meet a semi-retired senior witcher and be offered a mixture of post-graduate tr…",
