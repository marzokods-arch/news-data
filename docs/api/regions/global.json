Or, actually, on national UK radio, which is what they used to call podcasts back during the war. Houser popped up on Virgin Radio UK to chat with host Chris Evans (not that Chris Evans) about his new book. Along the way, though, the inevitable topic of AI and what it means for human labour and creativity reared its head. It sounds like Houser isn't quite as starry-eyed about the tech as so many other people who continue to occupy corporate C-suites. Asked if AI is going to lead us to the sunlit uplands so many tech 'visionaries' are promising, Houser is unequivocal: \"I personally don't think it will, because I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it—which is really superficial—the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models. So it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease.\" Which, I have to admit, is a pretty good simile for the AI craze. That's not to say Houser thinks gen-AI will have co…",

Oh, and that it's located in a church in San Francisco? News outfit CNN caught up with the Internet Archive, which incorporates the Wayback Machine, recently. Located on Funston Avenue in San Francisco in a large neoclassical building that used to be a Christian Scientist church, the Wayback Machine now maintains 29 years of web history. Back in 1996 at the inception of the archive, a whole year's worth of webpages added up to about 2 TB of storage. Now, a mere day soaks up 150 TB and a copy of the entire archive is 175 petabytes and counting upwards . In October, the Archive celebrated the successful storage of one trillion web pages. While a set of servers have been \"symbolically\" placed in the former church building, the whole archive isn't actually stored in the Funston Avenue locale. Most of the archive’s servers are in a warehouse outside San Francisco, with copies distributed throughout the world. Those backups aren't just prudent in the event of fire, flood or other physical catastrophe. CNN points out that the Trump administration has de…",

The CPU has just appeared on AMD's driver page (spotted by Olrak29 ) with zero fanfare and zero details. Love that for us—we get to speculate a bit. The truth is, we've already had some leaks about the 9850X3D in the last few months, so we have an idea of what to expect, but none of it has come directly from AMD. At least we now know the processor exists, so chances are that the specs are real, but you never know with these leaks. Previously, another Twitter leaker, ch11eddog , said that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D would come with a 120 W TDP, eight cores and 16 threads, 96 MB of L3 cache, and a boost clock speed of 5.6 GHz. That gives it a 400 MHz advantage over the 9800X3D.

Oh, and with that comes the warning that the new AI features are prone to \"hallucinate\" and \"introduce novel security risks.\" As to the details, Microsoft says security flaws include \"cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.\" In other words, you could download, say, a PDF which contains hidden text instructing your Windows agent to execute nefarious tasks. And it might just carry out those instructions. So, surely Microsoft has some mitigations in place? Up to a point. Firstly and mercifully, these new agentic features are not enabled by default. However, once switched on, they're enabled for all users, all the time. They are at least labelled as \"experimental agentic features\", and a warning is delivered during the setup process.

That is, despite the fact that—aside from efforts so far mostly being bland as all hell, and confusing for the actual voice actors —players seem to have a deep appreciation for human performances. This is especially the case with Baldur's Gate 3, where performers like Neil Newbon and Amelia Tyler have gone on to become evangelists for the game. Speaking with our friends over at GamesRadar during the Golden Joysticks, Karlach's VO, Samantha Béart, says they've noticed this discrepancy first hand: \"There's a weird disconnect between, maybe, developers' attitude towards where we fit in the ecosystem—where we're not actually part of the team—versus the players, who very much see us as the forefront.

Besides, that is, the standard routine of a new realm opening up in the Dream Castle, and needing an extortionate amount of Dreamlight to get there in the first place. This lack of information is what makes preparation for an update like this so important. Even though you likely have the funds to get into the new realm, you might not have the friendship levels or materials you need to start making your way through Cinderella's unlock quests.

Tactics RPGs about students who fight demonic analogues of small-town problems at night, yet have to balance that with school and social obligations by day? I'd say sign me up, but even the shorter ones take 80+ hours and the longer ones demand well over 100. I tried Metaphor: ReFantazio and gave up in boredom during the second dungeon. They are not games that respect your time. So Demonschool, which seems to basically be a Persona game in all but name and the fact it can be wrapped in under 40 hours, should have been an instant slam-dunk. Our reviewer, Mollie Taylor, liked it well enough , praising the intricacy of its battle system and the wit of its dialogue, but had an important reservation. At launch, it suffered from \"some wonkily-threaded narrative beats\" and \"some general visual bugs and systems that felt a little obtuse at times\". No problems that couldn't be patched it seems, which made me put it on the \"wait\" pile rather than the \"play immediately\" pile. With every update it shifts a little closer to that second pile, and the latest, which Demonschool developer Necrosoft is calling its second big post-release patch , seeming like a s…",

I mean, I can't draw hands and feet either, but at least I know not to draw four toes on one foot and five toes on the other. Other billboards and paintings are being called out for having the smeary look common to a lot of AI art, and an anime-style spray of Marty McFly from Back to the Future looks enough like the Studio Ghibli AI knockoffs that briefly became the internet's favorite thing it's been looked askance at as well.

Blue & Blood is an ambitious total conversion mod that reimagines the game from the other side of the law—not as a young gangster clawing his way up, but as a cop teetering on the edge of corruption. The mod drops players into the boots of the LSPD’s most infamous unit, CRASH, in a story that blurs the line between justice and vice.

I was born to do one thing in this life, and that's to incessantly annoy everyone around me with my earworm flavour of the month. You know, those song soundbites that involuntarily bury into your brain before vomiting their way out of your mouth for hours, days, or even weeks on end. There was that time I got really into humming the Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare every time I accomplished a task. Or when I couldn't stop walking around singing just the drop from Tekken 7's Infinite Azure stage. My current one? The first verse in Heartbeat, Heartbreak from Persona 4. Or singing the chorus while hitting the Narukami Shuffle to the best of my ability. I'm still working on that part, my shuffle game is weak. Almost all of us will experience an earworm at some point in our lives, and there's a good chance at least one of them will be a song from a videogame. I mean, next to regular ol' music, videogame soundtracks are some of the stuff we'll listen to…",

Over 13 years after its release in 2012, Euro Truck Simulator 2 has surpassed its all-time concurrent player count peak on Steam, according to SteamDB . At time of writing, an hour has passed since the game hit a new all-time peak of 72,678, and while the number is flickering a bit, it's rare to see such a seemingly niche game so hoppin' over a decade after it came out. There are a few apparent reasons for this. The game just got two new DLCs on the same day: Nordic Horizons , which takes players through northern Scandinavia, and Forest Machinery , a smaller-scall add-on that piles on doodads like wood chippers and mulchers.

A striking example was recently provided by Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto, who revealed that Master Chief's suit design was revised nine times before Bungie settled on his final look. Lehto, who is an alumnus of Ohio's Kent State University, was speaking to Kent State Magazine (via GamesRadar ) about the impact his education had on his future career. During that interview, he chatted about the process Bungie went through to design Master Chief's armour. \"The creation of the Master Chief is something that I went through so many wringers to try to find the right look, the right feel, the right stature for such a character,\" Lehto explained. \"We tried a lot of things.\" Some of these initial designs have made it to the Internet, such as Shi Kai Wang's early concept for Master Chief. Apparently, Bungie felt those early designs were too stylised, and Lehto's later concept borrowed elements from the M1 Abrams tank and the lines of an Apache helicopter.

    "body": "Back in 2023, South Korean developer Wonder Potion released Sanabi , a sleek, cyberpunk-themed action platformer that saw players slinging themselves around levels with a giant grappling hook. Favourably compared to Katana Zero , it received near-universal praise for its crisp pixel art, Bionic Commando-esque platforming challenges, and surprisingly involved storyline. Two years on from Sanabi's launch, Wonder Potion has now released an expansion for Sanabi. Titled Sanabi: A Haunted Day , it’s a prequel spinoff in which you play as a different character from the main game. Also, it's completely free. Sanabi: A Haunted Day puts players in the role of Major Song, who has a minor role in the base game. As mentioned, the DLC takes place before the events of Sanabi, with Song investigating a sprawling robots scrapyard which the DLC's Steam page says is plagued by \"strange phenomena\". Alongside the new location, Song has a completely different moveset from the base game's protagonist. While she lacks a grappling hook, she is nonetheless capable of \"agile aerial manoeuvres\" such as an infinitely replenishable mid-air jump. She also wields a massive shotgun—which I always find endearing i…",

    "body": "When Games Workshop branched out into fiction it did so cautiously, with a string of short story anthologies before it committed to anything so ambitious as novels. A highlight of those anthologies were the stories about Gotrek and Felix, a duo in the sword-and-sorcery tradition, with one a homicidal maniac and the other a simple poet doomed to follow the other around recording his adventures while trying not to get killed by them. They were a perfect encapsulation of Warhammer, grim but also a bit silly, heroic but also earthy. Eventually they'd get their own novels, but first they appeared in a compilation of short stories called Trollslayer. Honestly, I don't think the Felix and Gotrek stories worked as well once they were expanded out to novel length. With a few exceptions, almost all of their best adventures were short stories like those collected in Trollslayer, which is why I'm interested in the special edition Games Workshop recently announced . The hardcover book comes with a bookmark shaped like an axe, art prints including a map of the Old World and a wanted poster for the book's ostensible heroes, two coins—a gold crown from Felix's home of the Empire, and a silver dwa…",

He said as much in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel yesterday—the same channel where he routinely shares insights and commentary from his entire body of gamedev work, including everything from the original Fallout to Wildstar and The Outer Worlds. The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't. To summarize, his argument is thus: canon is \"whatever the owner of the IP says it is,\" an individual's interpretation is personal and freeform and therefore \"you can't be wrong,\" and authorial intent is another matter altogether that usually differs from team member to team member, and may even diverge greatly from canon.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. When I say Arc Raiders , the first things that probably pop into your mind are arcs and raiding. But a huge part of Embark's hit extraction shooter isn't as action-oriented as any of that. A big part of the experience is managing your stash and selling anything that doesn't make the cut—well, if you're good enough at extracting with all of your loot. (Image credit: Embark) But first, you need to know what to sell. Learning which items are worth the most Raider Coins will mean you can buy more parts and weapons when times get tough. And knowing which ones you'll need for crafting and quests is crucial so you don't get stuck later on (it'd be nice if the game told you this, unfortunately it doesn't). Knowing the worth of items will also help you decide what to take back to Speranza with you when you're looting Topside. So to test you on your Arc Raiders trinket knowledge, I've amassed a bunch of in-game items, and will be asking you to rank them from most to least …",

Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . Like roughly half of the internet, I am fascinated by Kowloon Walled City . Built on the site of a military fort, the Walled City was a Chinese enclave situated within former British Hong Kong. Its existence was tolerated by Britain provided China made no effort to exercise its jurisdiction. This peculiar legal status left it largely ignored by both nations, and as such it became the site of rapid, unplanned urban development through the latter half of the 20 th Century. At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth. More than 35,000 people lived in an area of six and a half acres, giving it a density ten times that of Earth's most tightly packed cities like Giza and Manila.

The vast majority of people who play this Geometry Wars -inspired roguelike love it too, as its 97% positive Steam rating attests. But Steam's rapidly revolving release tombola means that making a great game is no guarantee of commercial success. And as Sektori's developer recently explained, the kaleidoscopic schmup is still a long way from making him any money. Reacting to Sektori's launch on Bluesky, former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen said reception to the twin-stick shooter had been \"awesome\" and \"much more than I expected for such a niche thing\". Lahtinen fully appreciates the highly specific appeal of Geometry Wars-style games, likely why Housemarque itself pivoted to making third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros. Now though, Lahtinen says the response to Sektori has given him hope. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. I went into this fully knowing I would never recoup. It would be my calling card, but nothing people would have ever heard of,\" he says. \"But 100+ Steam reviews, 97% positive + ~90 Metacritic is unexpected to say the least.\" Following this, …",

The fallout from its failure was even less savoury, with Build A Rocket Boy's boss Leslie Benzies reportedly blaming the game's failure on 'saboteurs', before the studio laid off more than a hundred employees.

    "body": "Cyber Monday is today, December 1 , and the gaming chair deals are in full swing. Not much has changed deals-wise since we first started curating them a week or more ago.

Top-end models like the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 are actually going back up in price, and the entry-level sector has such tight profit margins that big savings are unlikely. So it's the mainstream and mid-range models that are the ones to watch out for. The RTX 5060 Ti , RTX 5070 from Nvidia, and the RX 9070 from AMD could all be well worth snapping up this Cyber Monday.
