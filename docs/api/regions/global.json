The astonishing embryo models of Jacob Hanna Instead of relying on the same old recipe biology has followed for a billion years, give or take, stem-cell scientist Jacob Hanna is coaxing the beginnings of animal bodies directly from stem cells.&nbsp; Join these cells together in the right way, and they will spontaneously attempt to organize into an embryo—a feat that’s opening up the earliest phases of development to scientific scrutiny and may lead to a new source of tissue for transplant medicine. Hanna is the vanguard of a wider movement that’s fusing advanced methods in genetics, stem-cell biology, and still-­primitive artificial wombs to create bodies where they’ve never grown before—outside the uterus. But exactly how far Hanna has taken his models of the human embryo is an open question.

    "body": "Shantana Hazel often thought her insides might fall out during menstruation. It took 14 years of stabbing pain before she ultimately received a diagnosis of endometriosis, an inflammatory disease where tissue similar to the uterine lining implants outside the uterus and bleeds with each cycle. The results can include painful periods and damaging scar tissue. Hazel, now 50 and the founder of the endometriosis advocacy organization Sister Girl Foundation , was once told by a surgeon that her internal organs were “fused together” by lesions resembling Laffy Taffy. After 16 surgeries, she had a hysterectomy at age 30.&nbsp; Hazel is far from alone. Endometriosis inflicts debilitating pain and heavy bleeding on more than 11% of reproductive-­age women in the United States. Diagnosis takes nearly 10 years on average, partly because half the cases don’t show up on scans, and surgery is required to obtain tissue samples. But a new generation of noninvasive tests are emerging that could help accelerate diagnosis and improve management of this poorly understood condition.&nbsp; Within the next year, several companies, including Hera Biotech , Proteomics International , NextGen Jane , and Zi…",

Hanna, who has a trim beard and glasses and holds an Israeli passport, accepted the scrutiny. “It’s almost like you are under arrest, but in a friendly way,” he says. He agreed to turn over his phone and social media for inspection.&nbsp;&nbsp; “They said, ‘You have the right to refuse,’” he recalls, “and I said, ‘No, no, it’s an open book.’” The agents scrolling through his feeds would have learned that Hanna is part of Israel’s small Arab Christian minority, a nonbinary LGBTQ-rights advocate, and an outspoken critic of the Gaza occupation, who uses his social media accounts to post images of atrocities and hold up a mirror to scientific colleagues including those at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the pure-science powerhouse where he works—Israel’s version of Caltech or Rockefeller University.

    "body": "Chatbots today are everything machines. If it can be put into words—relationship advice, work documents, code—AI will produce it, however imperfectly. But the one thing that almost no chatbot will ever do is stop talking to you.&nbsp; That might seem reasonable. Why should a tech company build a feature that reduces the time people spend using its product?&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is simple: AI’s ability to generate endless streams of humanlike, authoritative, and helpful text can facilitate delusional spirals, worsen mental-health crises, and otherwise harm vulnerable people. Cutting off interactions with those who show signs of problematic chatbot use could serve as a powerful safety tool (among others), and the blanket refusal of tech companies to use it is increasingly untenable. Let’s consider, for example, what’s been called AI psychosis, where AI models amplify delusional thinking. A team led by psychiatrists at King’s College London recently analyzed more than a dozen such cases reported this year. In conversations with chatbots, people—including some with no history of psychiatric issues—became convinced that imaginary AI characters were real or that they had been chosen by…",
