Just a mere 4% of all Hot 100 No. 1s dating to the chart’s launch on Aug. 4, 1958, have earned the achievement. Olivia Newton-John’s “Physical” flexed 10 weeks at No. 1 in 1981-82, and that smash and Boone’s shared the mark for the longest Hot 100 reign for more than a decade, until Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road” dominated for 13 weeks in 1992. That best lasted briefly, as Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” led for 14 weeks in late 1992/early 1993. In 1995-96, Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men’s “One Sweet Day” ran up 16 weeks at No. 1, a milestone that held for more than 23 years. (Songs began logging longer No. 1 stays after the Hot 100 adopted electronically tracked data, according to Luminate, in late 1991.) In 2017, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito,” featuring Justin Bieber, tied the No. 1 run of “One Sweet Day.” By 2019, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, collected 19 weeks atop the Hot 100, a mark matched by Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” beginning in July 2024.

From early concept evaluations to full flight test campaigns, teams enhanced measurement tools, refined safety systems, and generated data that supported missions across NASA. Operating from the Mojave Desert, NASA Armstrong continued applying engineering design with real-world performance, carrying forward research that informs how aircraft operate today and how new systems may function in the future. The year’s progress also reflects the people behind the work – engineers, technicians, pilots, operators, and mission support staff who navigate complex tests and ensure each mission advances safely and deliberately. Their efforts strengthened partnerships with industry, small businesses, and universities while expanding opportunities for students and early career professionals. Together they sustained NASA Armstrong’s long-standing identit…",
