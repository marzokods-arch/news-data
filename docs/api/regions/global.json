    "body": "Just one week after a new trailer for the upcoming Mass Effect-alike Exodus was unveiled at The Game Awards, a Bloomberg report says James Ohlen, the head of developer Archetype Entertainment, has stepped down. The change comes as part of what appears to be a shakeup of gaming efforts at Hasbro, which has brought in industry veteran Paul Della Bitta to head up Wizards of the Coast's Digital Ventures division. Della Bitta spent 10 years across two stints at Blizzard, as well as two years as general manager of Riot Games in North America. More recently, he was a co-founder of Dreamhaven , the developer and publisher headed up by former Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime. But it's the departure of Ohlen that strikes me as the most notable development here, at least from a gamer's perspective. A 22-year BioWare veteran with lead design and director credits on everything from the original Baldur's Gate to Anthem, Ohlen took the wheel of a then-unnamed new development studio at Wizards of the Coast in 2019; Exodus, the studio's first project, was revealed at The Game Awards in 2023 . But just two years later, Ohlen is out. \"At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and …",

    "body": "Well, that didn't take long: Diablo 4 players have cooked up a completely automated build for the new paladin class that involves walking your dogs around while surrounded by a ring of fire. Never again will you need to burden yourself with pressing buttons once you get this build going as it's powerful enough to do everything in the game. Nobody has decided on an official name for it because it utilizes a bunch of different skills, but it's technically an \"auradin\" build like the ones you'd see during the days of Diablo 2. However, I propose that we start calling it the aura farmer build because the engine running everything is a holy aura that burns nearby monsters when you have a unique pair of gloves on. What's better than a single holy aura? 11 holy auras, obviously. In addition to surrounding your character, you can summon a pack of wolves and an ally mercenary who will inherit the aura too. Now, you have a whole team of aura farmers that leave a trail of ash in their wake. Outside of pushing into the high tiers of Diablo 4's hardest dungeons, this build only requires you to walk into enemies. There are buttons you can press to increase your damage, but they're optional. In …",

Care's tournaments, which the Mie prefecture-based organization has been running since 2019, feature rosters of senior citizen competitors in an effort to promote elderly social and mental wellbeing by creating \"an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in esports,\" according to its website . Currently, Care hosts its tournaments in Japan's Mie, Gifu, and Aichi prefectures, but the organization hopes to someday organize nationwide competitions. Livestreamed on Care's YouTube channel, the tournaments feature professional broadcast production with live commentary.

I use the inverted commas because, cute and cool as it was, the question of whether the rats were really playing Doom in any meaningful way, or just running on a ball for some delicious sugar water, was not conclusively answered. The project leader Viktor Tóth said at the time he wasn't happy with how they'd implemented the shooting response, and four years later the team is back with a new setup that significantly expands what the rats can do ( first spotted by Tom's Hardware ). And this time, the rodents are rocking a trigger mechanism. The first version had the rats suspended in a harness over a ball that rotated when they moved, with that movement mapped to a simplified version of a Doom corridor with an imp at the end. When the rat did the right things, it would get a reward in the form of sweetened water. The limitations meant that it was a bit of a stretch to say the rats were playing Doom, but as Tóth said you could make a decent argument they were \"kinda\" playing Doom. The new setup still maps the rat's real-world movement into a Doom environment, b…",

Embark issued a hotfix today that lowered blueprint drop rates from where they were at the beginning of the Cold Snap update, but it's not all bad news. \"Blueprint drop rates have been slightly lowered, but are still higher overall than before the 1.7.0 update,\" the patch notes read. Maybe that's the best compromise: Blueprints have felt pretty stingy in Arc Raiders since launch. I've played for nearly 50 hours and haven't managed to find more than seven—to be fair, I'm not looking all that hard, but it's strange that other rare loot (like fancy guns and gadgets) are significantly easier to find than the blueprint for items that aren't even that good, like muzzle brakes. That was probably the aim of raising drop rates in the first place, though Embark never actually confirmed it raised them in the first place until today's hotfix. My only regret is that I didn't jump back in while the loot was overgenerous. Oh well, at least I'm more likely to find the number one blueprint on my wishli…",

There are five Goblin King quests in The Forge, each a little more difficult (and expensive) to complete than the last.

Furthermore, 600 (or about 10% of all data centres) have been built in places that regularly breach that temperate 27 °C ceiling (via Tom's Hardware ). Data centres are already power hungry, collectively hoovering up 1.5% of the world's total electricity consumption (or 415 terawatt hours) in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency .

Nonetheless, over almost three decades of irradiated exploration, some standout missions have emerged.

Others are memorable simply because they're odd: creepy, daft or moving, written in a distinct tone that stands out against the green-grey backdrop of wasteland America.

All in the name of beaming Netflix and games into our eyeballs from increasingly small devices with better battery life. And the Western civilisation isn't the only one to broach the Future Era and have this capability, it now seems. According to two Reuters sources , China now has a prototype EUV chipmaking machine. It's not yet produced a working chip—that's anticipated to happen in 2028 by the Chinese government and more likely to be 2030—but it is apparently creating EUV light. The light source being one of (admittedly quite a few) technical marvels of the EUV machine today. This is a big deal because the West has previously had the entire monopoly on the advanced chipmaking market. The Dutch company ASML has been the sole producer of EUV machines, the likes of which chipmakers like TSMC buy …",

Turns out that this was a minor miscalculation on developer Embark's part, but only a minor one: the developer has now issued a hotfix that sees the blueprint drop rates \"slightly lowered\" though they remain \"higher overall than before.\" Now a further Christmas gift has been issued to all raiders. Log in to Arc today and you'll find Scrappy, the most demanding chicken in the world, serving up a cool 1,000 raider tokens for free. That's an amount that would normally cost you around $10 and, what's arguably more important, enough to buy a shiny new skin for your raider (or a hat for Scrappy). The gift is a tiny bit buried-away. You'll need to check your mail in-game, which is an icon in the top right of the inventory screen, and then open the email titled \"Happy Holidays!\" from the developers. Then you're all set. Oh, one more thing. I can't verify this, because I'm not a dirty cheater, but Embark previously implemented punishments for players who exploited a door glitch in the game: they'd get roasted alive upon glitc…",

Not because I didn't like them, but because I did.\" Goldfarb tells us that DICE pushed itself \"to do stuff maybe you wouldn't do if they were not there\".

Asus does point out on its security advisory page that although the problem is widespread and has a CVE rating of 7 (High severity), the vulnerability does require local access to the motherboard in order to gain access to the system RAM. The problem relates to the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) and add-on PCIe devices. The former has all kinds of protection mechanisms for direct memory access (DMA) operations, but Asus doesn't fully activate them on its Intel motherboards until just before the operating system is able to take over DMA protection duties. In other words, between first booting up the motherboard and the OS managing DMA operations, there's a window of opportunity for someone to use a PCIe device to gain access to system memory. That's obviously not a good thing, hence Asu…",

At the end of November, commercial font service Fontworks ended its most affordable license plan, LETS (Leading Edge Type Solution), which originally allowed game devs to use their Japanese fonts for only 60,000 yen (or about $380) a year. Parent company Monotype Imaging, which bought Fontworks back in 2023, then introduced a new pricing structure costing easily fifty times as much as the old plan (via Automaton ). US-owned Monotype's pricing structure initially offered no local pricing for Japan, but still expected devs to cough up $20,500 per year, in addition to agreeing to a ridiculous 25,000-user cap on games using the licensed fonts. Thankfully, the parent company has backpedalled a bit since, allowing developers to extend their licenses under the old affordable plan for the time being.

Sounds spicy. Before you envision yourself building new bases at far flung locations, the new maps are not \"anywhere near the size of like the Hagga Basin,\" Bylos said. \"They're smaller one-kilometer-by-one-kilometer maps in size, and they contain very specific activities.\" Building bases isn't one of those activities, but players will be able to complete \"combat missions, sabotage missions, crafting missions, harvesting missions, and exploration missions,\" said Bylos. \"And you choose one of those five mission types from the Landsraad board, and then you go to whichever map it points you to on the Overland.\" This folds into a new Landsraad specialization system included in the update, where players can earn XP in those differ…",

It rules. The third-stage Guild Navigator is the best and weirdest part of a very good and very weird movie. And yet, Denis Villeneuve has now made two Dune movies, and we still haven't seen his version of the third-stage Guild Navigator. Since Dune: Awakening is based on Villeneuve's Dune movies, we haven't seen a third-stage Guild Navigator in the game, either.

Even the title is a calligram: the umlauted O is our hero—the umlaut represents their ears—while the lowercase os are the bombs they carry around. In this puzzle metroidvania, the hero (let's just call them Ö from now on) can't really do much except explode those bombs. There is no jumping, no mantling, no attacking, no nothing, unless it can be achieved via the detonation of a bomb. When Ö starts with one bomb things seem simple enough: to jump, I spawn a bomb beneath myself and detonate. If I place a bomb and stand to the left of it before detonating, I'll be propelled leftward, which can be useful to clear a pit. Eventually Ö gets a second bomb, which offers a little more manoeuvrability while further complicating the puzzles. All this points to a clever but by no means revelatory puzzle game.

But the current design—a bit taller, a bit deeper—is far more suited to the task of keeping both high-end CPU and GPU combinations in check. While that does make the i600 a less compact gaming PC than the first iteration, it is a far more effective device because of it. And it's still pretty small if you compare it to most RTX 5080-based gaming PCs on the market. You can, of course, build out a small form factor mini-ITX machine in something like the Fractal Design Terra and have yourself a powerful micro machine, but it's not going to be able to get close to matching the cooling and aural design of the Corsair One. This thing is pacey, and this thing does it all with an understated grace you'll struggle to match with any compact DIY build. The key to that is the dual 240 mm AIO water cooling loops the Corsair One employs to keep its CPU and GPU components chill. There's a radiator in the top of the chassis that cools the graphics card and one in the side, which folds open, to look after the CPU…",

The memory company goes on to say, \"As a result, G.Skill procurement and sourcing costs have substantially increased. G.Skill's pricing reflect industry-wide component cost increases from IC suppliers and is subject to change without notice based on market conditions.\" G.Skill are just the latest memory manufacturer to speak on the subject of surging DRAM prices—add this statement to the pile. G.Skill joins modular laptop makers Framework, which has raised the price of its RAM options by 50% (though, somehow, this is still below the market rate). The market is so volatile right now that Samsung and SK Hynix are opting to \"minimize the risk of oversupply\" to avoid getting burned by another sea change—though that could drag out supply issues into 2028.

It's incredible to see actors and action from a century ago—and I'm trying very hard not to get on my own 'why don't we take videogame preservation as seriously?' soap box right now. Wikiflix pulls its video from a variety of sources, including YouTube, Wikimedia Commons, and the Internet Archive but I think the best part is that it's not just collating early examples of English-language cinema.

I can't imagine playing Diablo 4 without sanctification, a new crafting system that is technically exclusive to the season but shouldn't be because it's almost perfect. It is responsible for dramatically improving the core loop of the game in ways I wasn't really expecting after playing with an unfinished version on the test server a few months ago. Sanctification is essentially a way to gamble with items for a chance at extraordinary outcomes. You take a piece of gear to a special forge and roll the dice to see what new bonuses are added to them. And those bonuses aren't always some extra strength or maximum life; they can add effects from the best items in the game. A forgettable pair of gloves can become the most powerful gloves you've ever worn, if you're lucky enough. This means every piece of loot is an opportunity for something amazing.

Justin Theroux, who plays Robert House (one of the apparently two Robert Houses that have appeared in the show so far) may have just tipped us off to an exciting upcoming Fallout: New Vegas cameo. The revelation took place on the \"Fake Fallout Talkshow,\" which you'll find hidden on Prime TV's Fallout show page on the \"Extras\" tab. It's a short talk show—a fake one—hosted by comedian and actor Jon Daly as his \"Snake Oil Salesman\" character, the shady vagabond best known for having sex with chickens and giving Thaddeus the elixir that ghoulified him. There's some real Between Two Ferns energy to the fake show, with the Snake Oil Salesman asking inappropriate or insulting questions: in one episode, he asks Ella Purnell how much money she makes, and repeatedly badgers her about what it's like being on Stranger Things, a show she does not appear on.

That's left just a handful of die-hards still playing—currently a little over 200, according to SteamDB—which isn't enough to justify the expense of keeping Supervive running. That reaction …",

After that Unrecord went underground, as the two-man team began work on turning what was then a prototype into a full game.

I think KCD really fits into that trend.\" (Image credit: Warhorse Studios) So Warhorse isn't surprised we loved KCD2 as much as we did. Klima says the \"deep gaming audience\"—I think that's you and me—is getting older and more experienced, more prone to venture out beyond the familiar. \"In general, I think you can only eat so much popcorn,\" said Klima, \"and once you discover that there is more rarefied food available, then you are no longer so keen on popcorn.

The holidays are typically seen as an opportunity to reconnect with your family… but for me, they're also about reconnecting with my favorite games. With Xbox Game Pass, I can take my game collection everywhere I go this season—here are six games I'll be spending the holidays with. Fallout 4 (Image credit: Bethesda Softworks) I devoured every episode of the Fallout TV series when it came out. After it wrapped up, all I wanted to do was head back into the Wasteland and explore to the dulcet sounds of The Ink Spots. Set in an irradiated Boston, you'll build settlements, kill Deathclaws, and befriend a cast of compelling companions, like our synth buddy Nick Valentine. To me, all of that is secondary to wandering the vast open world, discovering secrets and creatively placed skeletons. Fallout 4 might be 10 years old, but it's still a multi-award-winning game that puts you in an immense and varied world. As we said in our review , \"It'…",

The problem is, it seems, the slow pace of game development—especially if you're Larian, you're going to be designing architecture for a game that'll be both simultaneously coming out in a few years but also releasing now, so figuring out a level of optimisation that's reasonable (while still making the thing look good) takes a bit of soothsaying. \"It kind of ruins all of your projections that you had about,\" he explains, \"because normally, you know the curves, and you can protect the hardware.

In conversation with Mark Hachman on The Full Nerd Network podcast , Crandall got specific, saying there's been \"a 246% increase in NAND pricing as compared to Q1 of 2025.\" He later goes on to elaborate, \"We just recently saw a 70% increase in NAND costs over… I think it was a 60-day period. So, that 250% I mentioned earlier—70% of that was increased within the last 60 days.\" As NAND flash chips make up about 90% of a single SSD's Bill of Materials cost, that's an especially eye-watering uptick for both businesses and general consumers alike. As such, Crandall offers a word of advice to anyone considering upgrading their rig's storage: \"Do it now and [don't] wait, because prices are going to continue to go up.\" In other words, we've yet to see just how high SSD prices can go.

And at first glance, a report that Nvidia is planning on cutting discrete GPU production by up to 40% just seems like a case in point. However, while it is all RAM-related, it's not necessarily bad tidings. The claim in question was posted on the Chinese Board Channels forum (via Benchlife and Overclock3D ) and basically claims that Nvidia is set to reduce the supply of its gaming GPUs by between 30% and 40% in the first half of 2026, compared to the volume of output during the same period in 2025. That's not surprising given that the DRAM supply problems, affecting the entire computing industry, will result in fewer desktop and laptop PCs being shipped next year. Given just how many of them typically sport an Nvidia discrete GPU, either soldered onto the motherboard or in the form of a third-party graphics card, the demand for RTX Blackwell chips is obviously going to plummet. However, there's not exactly a huge shortage of GeForce RTX 50-series cards at the moment, with the exception of sensibly priced RTX 5080 and 5090 models.…",
