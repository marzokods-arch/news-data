    "body": "Credit: Stephen Schenck / Android Authority I’ll admit it: I’m a bit of a smart home troglodyte, unwilling to trade classic simplicity for modern convenience. My Google Home setup is limited to a glorified kitchen timer; I don’t have the patience to set up light routines or safely store offline camera footage. I own a few pieces of connected kit; my robot vacuum cleaner seems harmless enough, and I’ve even hesitantly installed a smart thermostat to cut my energy bill and keep my house warmer. But that’s it. One line I’ve certainly never dared to cross is installing a smart lock on my door. I can’t convince myself of the benefits over a good old-fashioned key, especially given some pretty reasonable concerns about service outages or somehow locking myself out of my home (though I have managed that with a regular key, to be fair). But I’ve just discovered a new fear I didn’t know I had — being locked in a smart home.",

The compact Find X9s could come in Titanium, Orange, and Blue finishes, while the Find X9 Ultra could come in Orange, Black, and Brown. The Find N6 foldable could come in Orange and Titanium colors. 2026 could be a big year for OPPO, as the company is widely rumored to be launching several of its top Android flagships globally. This includes not only its foldable flagship, the Find N6, but a wider foldable expected to be called the Find N7 , as well as phones like the Find X9s and Find X9 Ultra in its flagship lineup. As we inch toward these launches, a new leak sheds more light on the colors we can expect on some of these phones, as well as their global release timelines.

After all the hype around the concept of a desk chair that bends with you as it reclines, how does the final product stack up?

    "body": "TL;DR OnePlus’ bypass charging feature now works beyond gaming, letting phones pull power directly from the charger during heavy use to reduce heat and battery wear. More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

Regulators want specific, detailed accounts of failed calls, text issues, 911 access, and business impact from the public. You can submit your report until March 16, 2026. If you saw an SOS icon instead of your usual 5G bars last Wednesday, you probably felt cut off from the digital world. Verizon has since fixed the problem and restored service , but the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now starting its own probe. Regulators have officially launched an investigation into the 10-hour blackout that sidelined millions of customers and, more critically, potentially blocked access to 911. On the afternoon of January 14, Verizon’s wireless voice, text, and data services failed for users across the country. Outage reports quickly rose on trackers like Downdetector, reaching hundreds of thousands in just a few hours. Many customers saw only the SOS icon instead of signal bars, which meant they could still call emergency services, but regular calls and data did not work.",

This could be due to the company’s interpretation of EU regulations regarding software updates. It seems like the regulations don’t actually force smartphone makers to offer software updates at all. The European Commission introduced a variety of regulations for electronics that went into effect last year. One of these rules forces manufacturers to up their game when it comes to software updates. Unfortunately, it sounds like the EU’s own wording has enabled brands like Motorola to actually offer phones with disappointing update policies .

    "body": "TL;DR The 8849 Tank X is a rugged Android phone with a built-in 1080p DLP projector. It features niche features for outdoor adventuring plus 16GB RAM, 512GB storage, and a massive 17,600mAh battery. Pre-orders are live now, with shipping expected in early February. Rugged phones are rarely shy about excess, but 8849’s Tank X pushes the envelope. Alongside its oversized battery and reinforced frame, the phone adds an unusual headline feature: a built-in 1080p projector. The integrated DLP projector displays a 1920×1080 Full HD image at around 220 lumens, and supports keystone correction and laser auto-focus up to roughly 4 meters, helping keep projections sharp and properly aligned with minimal manual adjustment. While it’s certainly not going to replace your TV, it’s a notable step up from the dim, novelty projectors previously attached to smartphones, and one that could prove genuinely useful for camping trips or quick presentations in the field.",

Last September, Google TV’s homescreen received an updated navigation bar along with a shortcut to launching Gemini. While that update is still rolling out to users, Google appears to be testing a new set of changes to the navigation bar, making it easier to browse content across different apps. According to Reddit user Jodath79 (via 9to5Google ), the Google TV interface is getting two new tabs on the top navigation bar. These new tabs, placed between the Live and Apps tabs, are designed to search for “Free” and “Paid” content across apps installed on the Google TV.",

The change introduces a new “geofenced variable power” category, allowing higher power and outdoor use under specific conditions. While little will change overnight, the decision could improve future Wi-Fi performance for your phone, smart home gear, and more. Wi-Fi doesn’t usually make headlines unless something breaks, but this week it got a boost that could shape the next wave of connected gadgets. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has voted to expand how unlicensed devices can use the 6 GHz band, a move that could make future Wi-Fi gear faster and more flexible than what we have today. As Fierce Network reports, the FCC’s decision creates a new category of unlicensed devices called geofenced variable power (GVP).

A much larger cover screen is also said to be coming, while the inner screen could grow to 7.5 inches. The camera setup could get its own dedicated space instead of sharing it with the outer display like before. HUAWEI’s follow-up to one of the most unconventional flip phones of recent years seems poised to push its weird-but-wonderful design even further. A new leak suggests the HUAWEI Pura X2 would be a rethink of the form, especially how you interact with it before and after unfolding. When HUAWEI launched the first Pura X in 2025, it stood out by offering a wide 16:10 inner display instead of the usual tall, narrow screen.

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar has restored support for the most common .3ds file type. Support was previously removed to distance the project from game piracy. The removal prompted forks that restored support, causing confusion for users. Azahar provided a light at the end of the tunnel after the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra was caught in the crossfire of Nintendo’s legal actions against Yuzu, but there was always one major complaint. A complaint that earned it countless poor reviews on Google Play, causing great confusion among users and spawning several sketchy forks. That change is the removal of support for .3ds files, which is by far the most common ROM file type for Nintendo 3DS games. The team claimed this was to distance the project from its predecessor’s dubious roots in piracy, but in practice, all you needed to do was change the file extension from .3ds to .cci, and it still worked, provided the files were not encrypted.",

Google will pay out $135 million to affected users and make adjustments to Android behavior and terms of service. Google has agreed to pay $135 million to settle a class action suit over “appropriating” Android users’ mobile data. The suit accused Google of harvesting Android user data over cellular connections without their consent, including at times when Google’s apps were closed on those users’ devices. As reported by Reuters , a preliminary settlement was filed Tuesday night and is pending approval from a judge. Assuming there aren’t any last-minute changes, anyone in the US (outside of California) who’s accessed the internet using a cellular network on an Android device since November 12, 2017 will be eligible to claim part of the settlement.",

Rogbid isn’t a big name in wearables, but it’s been selling budget smart devices for years. As spotted by The Verge , the Fusion is now available from Rogbid’s online store for $49.99. That’s far cheaper than most ring watches, and it comes in gold, silver, and black finishes.",

After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration.

    "body": "Credit: Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has released a new update for the Galaxy Watch 4, fixing issues brought by the One UI 8 upgrade last month. Multiple users on Reddit have confirmed that issues with their Galaxy Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic have resolved. The update also brings the January 2026 security update. The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",

Apple dominated the top four spots globally with the iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 lineups. Demand for affordable 4G devices remains surprisingly high, as seen in the success of the Galaxy A06 4G, which sold more than any Galaxy S25 series flagship. With all the marketing hype around Android flagships , you’d think that some of them would go on to be best sellers for the year. Take, for instance, the Galaxy S25 series , which launched globally in January 2025, giving it a strong position to emerge as a global top-seller in 2025. As it turns out, the most popular Galaxy phone of 2025 isn’t the Galaxy S25 — it’s not even a flagship at all. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Nothing Phone 3 can be classified as less than a success. While it excelled in terms of fun, quirky features , the Phone 3 did not thrive in terms of practicality or value. Despite its novelty, the non-flagship chipset and an $800 price tag easily made the phone feel impractical . And Nothing appears to have taken the verdict to the heart, to the effect that it is taking 2026 to mull over flagships instead of releasing one. In a recent video shared on the official Nothing YouTube channel, co-founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship phone in 2026. This could be a shocker for Nothing fans, as it seemingly was for the staff member speaking with Pei on the talk show.

For a long time, my stubbornness worked — I just waited patiently for top TikTok videos to hit Instagram and then laughed just like everyone else. But when a group stepped in to take over TikTok in the US from ByteDance and implemented strict new terms of service, it grabbed my attention. It amped up tracking, pared back privacy, and caused users to flee in droves — many turning to a new platform I’d never heard of called UpScrolled .",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Global smartphone chipset shipments are expected to fall 7% in 2026, but industry revenue is still set to grow in double digits. AI-driven data center demand is pushing chipmakers toward high-margin HBM, driving up DRAM prices and squeezing phone makers. Budget phones under $150 are taking the biggest hit as rising costs make low-end devices harder to sustain. The smartphone industry is facing a paradox. Counterpoint Research reports that global smartphone chipset shipments will drop by 7% in 2026. Normally, fewer shipments would mean trouble for the industry , but this time, manufacturers are still expected to see double-digit revenue growth. So, why are shipments dropping? Part of the reason is the growing demand from data centers . As AI becomes more common, chipmakers are shifting their resources to produce high-margin HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for large server farms. This shift has caused DRAM prices to rise sharply, making it harder for manufacturers to create affordable phones without taking a loss.",

Many reports also suggest that the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi issues may have been patched. Google is terribly late at delivering the latest January update to supported Pixel devices. While the update was initially rolled out on January 12 , many users reported not receiving it until earlier this week. More than a thousand Android Authority readers also corroborated this in a recent survey. Thankfully, it appears Google may have finally ironed out what was causing the delay. We’re seeing new reports from multiple Pixel owners on Reddit confirming they finally received the January update. Reddit user Different_Dinner8195 recently posted in the Google Pixel subreddit, declaring they were finally able to download and install the update on their Pixel 10 Pro. As with many others who reported this earlier, the January update first appeared for the user but then disappeared mysteriously, leaving folks wondering whether Google pulled the update.

One such change is Ask Photos, an AI-powered search feature intended to help people find content with natural language queries.

The company says the issue affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under rare conditions. Manual and automatic Call Screen still work, and callers can continue using standard carrier voicemail instead. Most recent Pixel features have been welcome additions, but one meant to handle missed calls has instead caused a bit of a privacy snafu. Over the past few months, some users reported that callers could hear background audio during missed calls, rather than being cleanly prompted to leave a message. Google has now confirmed the issue and says it’s disabling Take a Message on the affected devices. In a post on its support forums , Siri Tejaswini, a Google community manager, said the company investigated the reports and confirmed they affect “a very small subset” of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under “very specific and rare circumstances.” Out of caution, Google is disabling Take a Message and its next-generation Call Screen features on those phones.",

AI-generated images just found a new canvas: your wall. SwitchBot’s latest isn’t a robot or a smart lock. It’s a collection of E Ink picture frames that double as always-on AI art displays. On the hardware side, the frames feature E Ink Spectra 6 technology, designed to mimic the layered look of real paint on real paper. As with other E Ink displays, the result is glare-free, backlight-free, and easy on the eyes, making it better suited as wall art than an LCD or OLED screen. Through the SwitchBot app, users can upload and organize artwork, store up to 10 images locally, sync new content, and schedule images to cycle on and off at given times of day. The frames are available in 7.3-inch, 13.3-inch, and 31.5-inch builds, each of which supports both horizontal and vertical orientations.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 series’s launch pricing may be the same as last year’s S25 series, at least in some markets. This is contrary to earlier reporting that suggested increased RAM prices would lead to higher S26 prices for consumers. The leak in question deals with pricing in Euros, and we can’t be totally sure what it means for US pricing. RAM prices have been soaring in recent months , a trend that’s caused product delays and fueled concern that new consumer electronics of all kinds will see reduced memory, higher sticker prices, or both. It was reported in November that the upcoming Galaxy S26 series was likely to see a RAM-induced price hike versus last year’s S25 phones, but a new leak suggests that might not be the case. Leaker Roland Quandt posted today on Bluesky that pricing for S26 base models will be “pretty much the same” as the S25 at launch, at least in European markets. His post goes on to say that the S26 Ultra may actually be less expensive, coming in about “100 Euro cheaper for 256 and 512GB” models, though he’s expecting the one-terabyte version’s pricing to remain the same.",

Side panels can exist independent with their own Gemini conversation, or share awareness across tabs. For all the places Gemini has popped up since its inception, probably one of the most powerful has been in our browsers. And beyond just using them to access Gemini’s home on the web, last year we started seeing Google bake Gemini right into its Chrome browser . Now, in early 2026, Google’s only strengthening the connection between Gemini and Chrome, delivering a new side-panel Gemini view and integrating the utterly fantastic Nano Banana.

With Gemini in the sidebar, Chrome will soon let you access information from other Google apps and services using “Personal intelligence.” Gemini in Chrome will also be able to perform tasks in other apps, such as Gmail, without opening them in a separate tab. For nearly two decades since its launch, Google Chrome has been the dominant choice as a web browser for most users. While that remains statistically true to date, newer browsers, such as Comet, Dia, and Opera Neon, have challenged its supremacy with agentic browsing . After months of teasing through other apps , Google is stepping up Chrome’s game with agentic capabilities that will browse the web — click links, scroll pages, type, and not just pull information — for you. And with this, Gemini in Chrome is also on its way to being more personalized. Google recently rolled out Personal Intelligence to Gemini across its mobile apps and the web interface. The function allows Gemini to pull context from different Google apps, including Gmail, Photos, and more, and combine it with your chats and recent history to give you bet…",
