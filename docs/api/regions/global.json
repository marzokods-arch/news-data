If you were hoping for some more boss nerfs or perhaps fewer obstacles on the way to bosses, then give up all hope ye who enter here. No, the latest Silksong patch—which is currently live in the public-beta branch on Steam, but will roll out officially in the coming days—is mostly about making sure the bosses themselves don't keep making dumb mistakes. Spoilers follow, but this includes: Preventing the Savage Beastfly in Far Fields from getting stuck under lava, preventing Shrine Guardian Seth from exiting the battle arena mid-combat, and making sure Lugoli stops \"flying off screen and not returning during battle\". I like a tough metroidvania and wouldn't advocate for any difficulty tweaks, but I know there are plenty of players who are frustrated with Silksong's difficulty.

Redditors have been compiling the evidence pointing towards a VR hardware reveal from Valve on Wednesday, including multiple VR-focused YouTubers traveling to the Pacific Northwest. Competitor Meta is actually hosting its annual Connect event on September 17th and 18th, but multiple influencers have confirmed they won't be at the event (which is in Silicon Valley, not Valve's native Bellevue, Washington). Notably, Valve timed its last big VR reveal of the Index to coincide with a Facebook developer event in 2019. It sure seems like it's pulling the same strategy again for the Steam Frame, and if I had to guess its pitch will be much more focused on gaming and high-end VR tech while Zuckerberg uses Meta Connect as an excuse to hock some new AI stuff that'll make all of our lives a little…",

That would be such a fundamental bug that it would effectively break the game. Anyway, I loaded in, did some testing, and you can probably guess where this is going. We are investigating an issue where players are unable to respawn in Solo Ops activities after dying. We are attempting to solve this issue as soon as we're able. More information will be provided when available. September 16, 2025 From my own experience, once you die the respawn button will appear after the usual countdown, but cannot be interacted with. In order to start playing again you either need to go to orbit (ie, leave the activity) or switch characters. Which is as big a problem as it sounds. The bug even seems to extend to Patrol zones, although I was occasionally able to self-revive. Quite how long it will take to fix is anyone's guess, but as you can tell by the tone of Bungie's tweet, this is a four alarm fire. You cannot have players trying to complete every solo activity in the game on a single life. I would love to tell you I'm surprised that a bug of …",

    "body": "Escape from Tarkov is finally crossing the Rubicon into a 1.0 release on November 15, and it just unveiled something that might be a little surreal if you've followed the game's eight years in early access: its very own Steam page, where it'll soon have achievements, the Steam overlay, friends list integration and all that great stuff. This will be most exciting if you don't own Escape from Tarkov yet and have been holding out for this very moment. If you already own it and want to play it through Steam, though, you'll need to buy it again and link your Steam account to your existing Tarkov profile, Battlestate confirmed in a blog post. It's all on the same servers so you won't have to buy the Steam version to play with Steam players, and you've always had the option of adding Tarkov as a non-Steam game to your library if all you want is the ease of access and the overlay. But all the other big features—friend list synchronization, Steam achievements, lifelong playtime tracking—will be exclusive to those who buy it through the platform. It also means players with thousands of hours sunk in will only be able to leave a review on the new storefront if they buy the game again. If you…",

    "body": "A trailer dropped today for Netflix's animated Splinter Cell show, and it's all guns and glory. Bloody fistfights, car chases, a diving tackle through a window—all to unravel a mystery that hits awful close to home for our grizzled protagonist. \"Sam Fisher is back and this time, the mission is personal.\" Again! It hits all the narrative and aesthetic beats I expect out of a modern spy thriller, and through that lens, I think it looks pretty neat. There's a mysterious wristwatch with coveted blueprints inside it somehow and yes, they plug it into a giant wall of green monitors, and yes, I eat that kind of thing up. But short of a few referential nods, I think the trailer is sadly a little light on Splinter Cell vibes specifically. It's a lot of action and energy for largely methodical, unhurried stealth games. My favorite moments in Splinter Cell never involved big fist fights or car chases, they involved silently panicking as guards circled me hiding in the one safe shadow in a patrol-filled room. Guns and brawls were a sign things had gone wrong, and I was most elated when the only enemies that ever saw me ended up unconscious in a crate somewhere. Okay, maybe that wouldn't make …",

    "body": "For the first time in a while, a Diablo 4 season won't just be about fancy new powers for your build. In season 10, or the Season of Infernal Chaos , the best loot in the game can drop as \"Chaos armor\", allowing you to use items in ways you never could before. Several Unique items and their powerful guaranteed stats will have new Chaos variants that are even more powerful than normal and can be equipped in new slots on your character. The idea is that a Unique that could only drop as gloves before can now show up as a pair of boots or some other piece, which opens up all kinds of combinations and new builds. \"A lot of us in the office are fans of card games, and what you do in card gaming is you typically build a deck from a bunch of different cards,\" game designer Aislyn Hall explained when asked about the inspiration for Chaos Armor on the stream. \"When I'm building my character in an ARPG, or a Diablo, I think about it in the same lens.\" Diablo 4 seasons have never felt this experimental.

Soon it'll be a bit easier to enter the arena of galactic grand strategy without an Olympic swimming pool-sized dining table, because Twilight Imperium is coming to Steam.

One of the developers heavily affected was Zenimax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO), which saw the cancellation of an MMO codenamed Blackbird alongside an unspecified number of layoffs. Such was the impact of the latter that, despite not being included in the initial round of cuts, long-serving ZeniMax president Matt Firor fell on his sword after 18 years as studio head. \"He wore a lot of different hats,\" says Rich Lambert, the new studio game director at Zenimax, in a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz . Firor's responsibilities have been split across Lambert and new studio head Jo Burba, who's \"focused on the operational side of things, and I'm focused on a lot of studio-level things and future planning.\" Some would speculate the layoffs are what lies behind Firor's departure and, while Lambert doesn't confirm this, he make…",

Okay, yes, some version of that happens in a lot of MMOs, but it's a particular thorn in the side for Jagex and its players, leading as it does to legions of bots infesting the game in order to vacuum up gold to sell later on.

That's where the best XP farms come in, netting you heaps of experience to level up fast and with less effort, so you can focus on your favourite bits. If it's your first run through the campaign, I'd generally recommend just completing the story and exploring the open world—there's little reason to grind before then. Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters . Best Borderlands 4 XP farms The two best ways to farm XP in Borderlands 4 are to complete bounty contracts and grind drill site activities , with the latter being even better when you're playing in co-op.

The only N2 chips AMD has planned for next year, as far as we know, are server CPUs, not GPUs. AMD's next major AI GPU release, MI450 , is expected to be on TSMC N3 silicon. Nvidia currently uses a version of TSMC's N4 node for all its GPUs. N4 is actually a refinement of N5, which dates back to 2020. Meanwhile, the first chip made on TSMC's N3 technology, the Apple A17 Pro SoC for iPhones, debuted back in 2023. Consequently, Nvidia is now bumping up against what's known as the reticle limit with its Blackwell generation of GPUs .

As BogdanTheGeek, the person who made the vape-powered site, says: \"I wouldn’t want to be the lawyer who one day will have to argue how a device with USB-C and a rechargeable battery can be classified as 'disposable'.\" The horsepower of these little devices might not be much, but it's enough to host a bona fide website. And sure, we're getting a lot of 503 errors at the moment, but that's because a ton of people must be visiting the site right now after learning about it. The text contents of the website explain how it was achieved, but you can find another style…",

Nearline HDDs are ones used for infrequently accessed data, acting neither as cold (long-term) nor hot (rapidly accessible) storage but something in between. They're primarily used for data such as backups. The AI boom has meant there's more of this storage in demand than before, to keep previous AI training data and model roll-backs, for instance. One recent example of this increased demand comes from Western Digital. The company recently split from its SSD arm, Sandisk, to focus entirely on HDDs. TrendForce relays a notice from the company that was \"spotted by industry sources\" and explains that there is \"unprecedented demand for every capacity in our portfolio.\" Consequently, WD \"will be gradually implementing price increases on all HDD products, effective immediately.\" It will also expand its \"use of ocean freight\", which will increase transport time by a few weeks but \"significantly r…",

So, why not take this inherent strength and pair it with a massive 90% damage boost? That's exactly what you get with the Hot Slugger . There are well over 100 legendary gear items in Borderlands 4, and the Hot Slugger should be near the top of your list, no matter which character you're playing. It's powerful, sure, but you also spin it around like a cowboy when you reload it, and that's just cool. How to get the Hot Slugger in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get the Hot Slugger from Callous Harbinger of Annihilating Death, the final boss of the Craven's Nook Order bunker in the Bones of Sanctuary , to the east of Terminus Ridge. You'll need to progress the campaign until you can leave the Fadefields region, as not only is this area far away, but you also need to remove the armour on the door—just look over the ledge to the left of the door, and you'll find a bio canister that you can throw at it to unlock the bunker.

Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it.

In its game discovery newsletter , games industry analyst firm GameDiscoverCo estimates based on available data that Hollow Knight: Silksong has already sold more than 3.2 million copies on Steam. Additionally, GameDiscoverCo reckons it's been downloaded approximately 1.5 million times through Xbox Game Pass, though it's unclear how many of those downloads were distributed between console and PC. For an indie release from a relatively small production team, that's a phenomenal success, particularly when compared with other Metroidvanias. Silksong's in a genre with no shortage of enthusiasts, but Metroidvanias aren't what we'd typically consider as having mass market appeal. Comparing Steam sales numbers against other games released this year with the Metroidvania tag, GamesDiscoverCo says \"Silksong's dominance is striking.\" U…",

    "body": "I'm making my way slowly to the end of Act One in Silksong, and one of my mainstays has been Thread Storm, a powerful AOE multihit ability that can be acquired fairly early on. But I've been a fool: despite using the attack in multiple boss fights, I actually haven't been getting as much damage out of it as I could've. Thanks to a PSA video from Jason Mondal on YouTube, I only just learned how to use Thread Storm to its full potential. Instead of pressing or holding right bumper on a controller once to activate the ability, you can rapidly mash the button to extend its duration without using more silk, giving you more damage per cast. The only downside is that this leaves you vulnerable to a counterattack for longer, but that's kind of the basic tradeoff of Thread Storm already. My preferred deployment is at a diagonal, up and slightly to the side of a boss to get them in the AOE while having a good chance of avoiding any attacks. Against enemies who can be staggered by Thread Storm, though, there's practically no disadvantage to using its max duration⁠—this ability can be a huge help during any of those tricky wave fights.

The entire build revolves around throwing knives that cause your normal damage to become critical damage. You can find the \"Penetrator Augment - Damage\" stat on any Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife in the game and it'll work regardless of the item's level. NickTew's character is level 50 and his level 35 knife works because the stat is the same no matter what.
