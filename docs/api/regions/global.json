It's still kicking, though, and still working on a new Mass Effect game—and executive producer Michael Gamble would really like it if you'd all stop yelling at him about it. \"Like you, we’ve heard the rumors lately,\" Gamble wrote in his traditional N7 Day blog post . \"You’ve made it clear you care deeply about what’s next. So let’s start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe. \"The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show.

As Ted pointed out earlier this year , it's a little hard to comprehend that a free to play idle gardening game for Roblox made in a couple days by a teenager is more popular than any game you've ever played in your entire life. But it's true. By reported concurrent player counts, Grow a Garden is bigger than PUBG ever was on Steam, by far. It's even bigger than Fortnite. So, as Hollywood rushes to convert pretty much every game from Call of Duty to The Sims into beaucoup boxoffice bucks, I have some sad but not-unexpected news to deliver to the parents of all those Roblox-obsessed kiddies. Sorry, folks: you're gonna be dragged to the theaters in about a year to sit through Grow a Garden, the movie. On the plus side, it'll get your kids to stop playing Grow a Garden the game for about 90 minutes. Silver lining? Deadline reports that Story Kitchen, which produced the Sonic the Hedgehog films and is developing movies based on games like It Takes Two and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, is now developing a Grow a Garden feature adaptation. \"Grow a Garden is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt,\" said Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. …",

Blizzard has yet to step in on a newly discovered method of spawning endless numbers of enemies in the latest phase of Legion Remix. Unlike the Gulp Frogs incident in Mists of Pandaria Remix, this farm seems relatively less broken, but it still can net you millions of infinite power, which is used to level up your weapon and increase your character's overall strength. It's been two days since players began capitalizing on it and Blizzard hasn't made any move to kill it. The exploit does, however, cause serious lag from the volume of enemies pouring in if you happen to be nearby, which might be enough for it to land on Blizzard's nerf radar. For now, players are grouping up to slay as many demons as they can before the valve gets shut off. The Sentinax farm, as it's being referred to, is pretty straightforward. In the Broken Shore area there's an event full of demons that drop items you can use to spawn more demons. The trick is to join a group so you can keep a constant supply of them flowing in.

But Inzoi didn't deliver the adrenaline shot I'd predicted and (still upcoming) Paralives has always been expected to be the smaller contender. Now, news about the future of The Sims series itself just keeps getting worse. The life sim revolution I'd predicted didn't turn up this year and now I'm worried it never will. The Sims 4 (Image credit: Maxis, Electronic Arts) Eleven months ago I was optimistic. Even though we'd already gotten the bad news that there isn't going to be a Sims 5 , things were looking swell for the rest of the series during its 25th anniversary in January. EA made some updates to The Sims 4 base game and re-released The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 in the Legacy Collection, making all four main games easily available on PC again for the first time in years. Heck, I fell in love with The Sims 2 again . Meanwhile the release date for Inzoi had been set for March and it …",

What you've also probably noticed is that opening up the view to make things more immersive just ruins the visual experience. The good news is that one UK team reckons it's cracked the problem, and it's already made the tools for game devs. Human vision has a horizontal field of view of around 200 degrees or so, but the vast majority of 3D games stick with 75 to 90 degrees. Many will let you play around with an FOV (field of view) setting, but once you go over 100, the edges go all kinds of wonky. It is possible, of course, to code a game so that it doesn't do this, but it's easier said than done. That's because while it's a piece of cake to increase the horizontal size of the frustrum created by the camera in a 3D world, objects at the edge of the FOV will look distorted and stretched unless this is all accounted for and corrected. And what might work fine at 110 degrees, for a game that's normally 90 degrees, might not work very well at higher FOV values. Enter stage left, Fovo Techno…",

No, I'm serious, after the last delay, it seems like everyone went through all the stages of grief and has reached acceptance , or near enough: \"Nothing wrong with delaying a game. Nothing at all. But why keep giving dates with so much confidence when they know it needs more time to polish?\" (Image credit: Rockstar) But among fans trying to rationalise another delay, there are others within the gaming industry sharing support , thinly-veiled threats , and even some theories about the breaking GTA 6 news. \"Interestingly, just a little industry knowledge for all you gamers, a Nov 19 launch puts them outside the nomination window for most game awards in 2026,\" Palworld's communications director, Bucky, says in a social media post . \"Intentional or…?

I had just one problem: The sound in Arc Raiders would persistently hiccup and hitch, and the troubles would get worse the longer I played. After three or four matches, the audio would drop out for a full second or two, intermittently but repeatedly, multiple times per minute. The game continued to run normally, to be clear, it was just dead silent. The effect was incredibly distracting and irritating, and for a game as dependent on audio cues as Arc Raiders, it was a deal breaker: I was ready to quit playing if I couldn't find a fix. Fortunately, I did find a fix. A search through the Steam forums revealed that I was far from alone in struggling with this issue, which made me feel slightly better about things—misery and company, and all that.

Surviving Mars comfortably slots into the first group, but given the original's relative youth, you could be forgiven for assuming it's part of the latter. Haemimont Games and Paradox Interactive released the original Surviving Mars back in 2018. In my Surviving Mars review , I said it was \"a lot of hard work, but managing a burgeoning colony never stops being compelling\", and then slapped an 80% on it. Thanks to the DLC, we were then able to keep expanding our colonies with new features all the way up to 2022. (Image credit: Paradox) This is not an ageing classic, then. Nor has its relevance diminished. Survival city builders are even more popular than they were when Surviving Mars first launched, and the fantasy of colonising Mars is as zeitgeisty as ever. It largely feels as fresh as it did back in 2018. Yes, it launched during a previous console generation, but it's compatible with PS5 and Xbo…",

It's become something of an old friend at this point, so I was anxious to test out its successor, the Logitech MX Master 4. This new model promises many improvements over its older sibling, but sitting the two next to each other reveals a surprising number of design-based differences I wasn't expecting. The MX Master 4 is taller at its peak, for a start. It's also a touch longer, a touch chonkier, and now comes with a substantial rounded ridge along the left side where the horizontal scroll wheel resides. The main buttons feel different, too, as they're now nestled inside a semi-translucent coating that strikes as one of the more bizarre additions I could think of adding to a mouse redesign. It's like they're trapped in some sort of see-thru amber, which means if you hold the mouse up to the light, you can see through the tips. If you keep your mouse on your desk, however, like some sort of norm-o-human, I doubt you'll ever notice. What you will notice, however, is the texture of the coating, which seems designed to prevent sweaty fingers from slipping around under some heavy click…",

The memory price crisis has come at my least favourite time: a time when it inconveniences me . You can have your early 2025 GPU shortage, that's fine. That didn't affect me, but this does, therefore it's bad. That's a valid argument, trust me, I did logic 101. You see, I considered upgrading my entire build a few months ago, but I put it off because the start of a new GPU generation isn't my favourite time to upgrade. So I came up with my cunning plan: I would wait until next year when hopefully RTX 50-series Super cards launch, and then I'd pounce. And I'd have the benefit of cheaper prices across the board by then, too. I can hear you snickering from here. 'Cheaper prices', I know. I've been foiled by the tumultuous tides of today's AI-first tech industry and resultant memory shortage. My current build, if you're wondering, consists of an RTX 3060 Ti, Core i5 12600KF, and 32 GB of DDR4-3200 RAM. And that's 3200 MT/s RAM that really cannot hit those speeds, at least not paired w…",

Instead of stumbling around Dam Battlegrounds, Spaceport, and Buried City, here's exactly where you need to go to complete each step of Greasing Her Palms.

In a post on Reddit , user Retrotom explains the steps they followed to get Nvidia's DGX Spark to natively run Cyberpunk 2077. The little 'AI-supercomputer-in-a-box' sports a GB10 APU, which has a 20-core Arm CPU and a Blackwell-based GPU with 6,144 shader cores. Cyberpunk 2077 runs on DGX Spark from r/nvidia The latter is, to all intents and purposes, the same GPU that's in a GeForce RTX 5070 . Same number of shaders, TMUs, ROPs, ray tracing units, tensor cores, and L2 cache. Where they differ is in VRAM and power. While the GB10 sports 128 GB of LPDDR5x unified memory across a 256-bit wide memory bus for 273 GB/s of bandwidth, the GB205 in the RTX 5070 is home to 12 GB of GDDR7.

That's just the kind of world we live in now. As an acknowledgement of this change, Collins Dictionary has awarded the term Word of the Year, despite, well, being two words. This week, Collins Dictionary posted a blog celebrating and explaining its choice for the Word of the Year (via The Register ). Vibe coding is relatively contentious in itself. Generative AI has been widely criticised for flagrantly ignoring copyright and for its adoption by investors declaring it's the next big thing in games, movies, or whatever art form you hold dear. And that's because there are productivity gains to be made in skipping through all the manual work of creative labour. Of course, that comes with its own set of problems. An overreliance on the black box that is generative AI can make coders less able to actually fix their own problems when they inevitably pop up. As well as this, we've seen stories of AI coding tools 'panicking' and destroying entire databases , and coding assistants being vulnerable to targeted attacks . That is to sa…",

(Image credit: Embark) It's an issue many players aren't willing to sweep under the rug: \"Bro, how are you gonna just shrug at $25 skin bundles in a $40 game? That's unacceptable.\" While another player points out , \"Those skin prices are kinda...brutal. And to add to that, we still have gameplay affecting items in the battlepass, in a $40 game.\" The discontent with how Embark is pricing their cosmetics has clearly been spreading for some time now, with the latest store update sparking an even angrier reaction from fans. 📡Store updateWhether you're cutting new paths topside or wading through the muck for buried treasure, gear up like a true survivor.The Le…",

However, the findings of one US repair shop suggest that this might not be the case, because at least two Corsair models don't have all of the fixes, and there's no way for owners to apply them. That's according to Matt's Computer Services on YouTube, which says that a $5,000 Corsair gaming rig, with a Core i7 14700KF, had been submitted to the repair shop three times, due to crashing in games. The host of the video explains that, having gone through every possible check and attempt at solving the problem (including usual things such as reinstalling Windows and trying a more powerful PSU), the issues persisted. It was only when they delved into the motherboard's BIOS that the penny finally dropped. The pre-built in question is using an Asus Prime Z790-P motherboard, updated to Corsair's most recent BIOS for it (version 9046).

Trials provides more challenges for players to complete during excursions, like damaging Hornets, searching new wave husks, or destroying Ticks, Fireballs, and Pops, alongside the quests that different raiders from Speranza give you. For each challenge, there are three milestones at 1,000 points, 2,500 points, and 4,000 points, and each milestone will reward you with a better mystery prize.

The recent claim that Nvidia will cancel its forthcoming GeForce RTX 50 Super series due to memory shortages is a prime example. As reported by Uniko's Hardware on X , someone, somewhere, is claiming that the DDR4/DDR5 memory shortages will make the cost of 3 GB GDDR7 modules so high that Nvidia is going to cancel the refresh of RTX 50 graphics cards, which are expected to use the larger RAM chips . Oh, and the current cards will get a lot more expensive for good measure, too. [rumor]due to the crazy shortage recently, 3gb gddr7 cant make it to the consumer market for desktop, thus the super series is cancelled.and the current models are expected to be more expensive very soon, because of the increasing cost of 2gb gddr7. pic.twitter.com/yMSMj1MjqJ November 7, 2025 There's little point in asking Nvidia directly about this because it will always just say things …",

Since the Refiner is used to craft certain higher-quality upgrade materials, like advanced mechanical and electrical components, levelling this station up should be a priority early on. For the level two Refiner, you'll not only need three toasters, but also five Arc motion cores and eight fireball burners . Luckily, the latter two are found on Arc machines—fireball burners specifically from Fireball Arcs, of course. Toasters, however, aren't so simple to track down. Where to find toasters in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) The best place to find toasters is the Village in the northwest corner of the Blue Gate map . Since this area is Commercial and Residential, there's a high chance of finding everyday technology like toasters inside the houses, whether that's loose on the kitchen countertops or inside cupboards. Village is also a very large area with lots of ground to cover, so you're bound to find at least one, if not all three, in a single run. Plus, yo…",

For studios planning a November 2026 launch, that nightmare became reality today when Take-Two announced a new delay . GTA 6 was originally slated to release on consoles in Fall 2025—around now!—before its initial delay to May 2026. If you look at the major games releasing in May 2026 as of now, you'll notice there's basically nothing because everything is shambling to escape Rockstar's orbit. And while it's true that May isn't usually a busy month for blockbuster game releases, in 2025 we saw Doom: The Dark Ages and Revenge of the Savage Planet hit PC, both of which would be cremated alive in a battle against GTA. Speaking anonymously to The Game Business on the announcement of GTA 6's first delay , the \"boss of one of the world's biggest game publishers\" admitted that Rockstar sucks a lot of money and time out of the market and that \"we don't want to be anywhere near that.\" Another anonymous s…",

It clarified a few basic things, like being able to buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance (and therefore with in-game gold via WoW tokens) and that it intends to keep the catalog small compared to what you can earn by playing the game. \"Housing items tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop,\" it says. \"Thematically important decor that players know and love will also not appear in the shop.\" Then it went on to explain why it's adding a premium currency in the first place, especially when it already sells mounts and cosmetics for real money values. In addition to providing \"appropriate financial protections for both parties\"—whatever that means—Blizzard says it's to help players purchase multiple items at once. \"As an example, you may want a full set of chairs to place around a dining table, multiple …",

I've long been looking for a great fantasy game where instead of a brave adventurer I could just be a humble tavern keeper, and it's finally arrived—and appropriately enough, it's called Tavern Keeper . Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it. Tavern Keeper's tutorial is almost shockingly brief: after plopping you into a rundown pub in a gloomy swamp, you run through the basics of how to buy kegs of booze and serve them to customers, hire workers and assign them jobs, and order supplies that can be cooked into meals. But that tutorial is just the start of a learning process that hasn't ended even after eight hours of play.

I'm old enough to have used my dad's PC to play games a few years before we got a dial-up internet connection at home, but I'm still too young to have ever internalized what \"online\" meant before the world wide web. Reading a recent blog by longtime Windows developer Raymond Chen, I realized that when '80s computer geeks used the term, its meaning was completely flipped. \"The term 'online' originally meant 'immediately available on a computer,\" Chen wrote, explaining why Windows 3.0 (which was released in 1990) included WinHelp, a program built for browsing \"online\" help files.

(More on this later.) Its continuing survival is notable because Rockay City brings a genuinely impressive cast of C-tier celebrities to the table—Michael Madsen, Chuck Norris, Michael Rooker, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, Kim Basinger, and Vanilla Ice—and yet is one of the most utterly mid-tier, 'why did they make this' videogames ever. It's not flat-out bad, mind, but as PC Gamer editor Wes Fenlon put it in a 2023 preview , Rockay City feels like the kind of game Uwe Boll would've turned into a movie.\" Anyway, back to the trailer: It looks like a fairly straight-ahead gameplay trailer, wi…",

For starters, the Minisforum MS-R1 runs a Cixin P1 CPU . It's a Chinese made chip built on 6 nm technology and configured with eight Cortex A720 performance and four Cortex A520 efficiency cores. In other words, we're talking off-the-shelf Arm cores first introduced in 2023 and part of Arm's mid-range Cortex A700 range, which is more about efficient mobility than outright performance.
