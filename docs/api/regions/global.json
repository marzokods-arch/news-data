    "body": "After a mysterious desert statue and trademark-filing snafu, Larian has officially unveiled its next game after Baldur's Gate 3 at The Game Awards. Larian is returning to its home-grown fantasy series with a new entry simply titled Divinity. We do not yet have gameplay or a release window, but Geoff Keighley described it as Larian's \"biggest game ever,\" and \"even larger than Baldur's Gate 3.\" After some surprise live antics, including performers being hoisted over the crowd in a high wire act, we got a pre-rendered trailer showing a much darker sort of game than we're used to from Larian. A tortured man is shown being burned alive in a Wicker Man-style enclosure, with celebrating peasants degenerating into an orgiastic bacchanal outside, overseen by flagellants and a masked cultist under some kind of celestial conjunction. This predictably unleashes some kind of unholy force that attacks the revelers, and after a fade to black, we can see that they've been incorporated into a gruesome amalgamation of bodies in the shape of that mysterious desert statue everyone was buzzing about. Well, now we know it was neither a portent of the end times, nor a marketing stunt for The Elder Scrol…",

At The Game Awards 2025, we got a brief teaser trailer for Fate of the Old Republic, a follow-up to the original games whose development will be headed up by Casey Hudson, project lead on KotOR 1 and the Mass Effect trilogy. The trailer shows an Unreal Engine-rendered star ship—not the original games' Ebon Hawk—piloted to a remote, snowy world. Its pilot and passengers, which include a droid resembling the HK series from KotOR, emerge and approach a downed Sith capital ship from the Old Republic games. There are any number of directions Hudson and co. could go with the story: KotOR 2 had a very vague, open-ending conclusion that has since been elaborated on in various bits and bobs of Star Wars lore crafting, most notably some of the expansions to the long-running Old Republic MMO, but that feels like the sort of stuff you can just treat as a suggestion. Lucasfilm Games and developer Arcanaut Studios are calling Fate of the Old Republic a \"spiritual successor\" to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.

We'd already heard Amelia Tyler (the narrator of Baldur's Gate 3, Hecate in Hades 2) as the villainous Shadwyn, but another BG3 alumnus, Devora Wilde (Lae'zel in Baldur's Gate 3, Tzarina Katarin in Total War: Warhammer 3), will be playing Deorcas Colwall, \"A formidable warrior whose grief has driven her to doubt her faith, leading her down a path of darkness.\" Her older brother, Rickard Colwall, will be played by Ben Starr (Clive in Final Fantasy 16, Prometheus in Hades 2, Jimbo in the unsettling Balatro commercial ). And Ellen Thomas (Ambessa Medarda in Arcane, Liz Webbe in live-action series Teachers) will be rounding out the cast as a \"charismatic and manipulative\" elf named Anabasia.

One of them is attached to a wheel! That's Dark Souls, to me. Set in an accursed castle, Decrepit seems to have something of a roguelike structure: You venture out from your dungeon cell, gather what loot you can, and try to fight your way to freedom before you're most likely killed and dragged back to the dungeons. But while enemies and encounters are shuffled every time you die, publisher Three Friends said in a press release, the castle's layout remains the same between runs. \"Inspired by classic first-person action games like Hexen, dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, and modern souls-likes, Decrepit emphasises spatial mastery over power creep,\" Three Friends said.

To put the cash to one side for a moment, over 200 Disney characters will now be used in OpenAI's products. This includes Mickey Mouse as well as more recent characters like Moana, and then there's Star Wars (the likes of Luke Skywalker included), Marvel, and the Pixar catalogue. Hey, has anyone here seen Wall-E? There is one very notable caveat to the agreement: Disney specifies it \"does not include any talent likenesses or voices.\" There are a host of obvious reasons why: primarily the likely objection of said talent, such as Mark Hamill, and the inevitable battle for rights that would ensue.

It's been a very slow roll since the firings were first revealed. Rockstar denied allegations that it fired the employees because they were attempting to form a union at the studio, saying initially that they were let go for \"gross misconduct,\" which it later elaborated to mean they had been \" distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.\" That denial didn't hold water with the fired employees and the Independent Workers' of Great Britain (IWGB) union, which filed legal action against Rockstar in November. November also saw the matter brought up in UK Parliament , as Edinburgh West MP Christine Jardine asked for a meeting with the relevant government minister \"to discuss what steps could be taken to support the workforce?\" The pressure on Rockstar went up significantly yesterday when the matter was raised in Parliament again, this time during Prime Minister's Questions, le…",

Unfortunately, PC hunters will once again have to wait to see the full extent of the performance fixes Capcom has been promising since July . While Capcom says the Title Update 4 launch will implement multi-platform optimization improvements, additional performance fixes specific to the PC version won't arrive until January in a follow-up patch.

Well, Nick Valentine's my favourite anyway. PCG's Ted Litchfield interviewed Bethesda's design director Emil Pagliarulo who, with Thief's Garrett as the launching point, went into detail on the early stages of Fallout 4, when the game was set in New York (it would end up being set in Boston). \"Stephen Russell was the first actor I ever wrote dialog for back in Thief,\" says Pagliarulo, referencing synth gumshoe Nick Valentine's voice actor. \"He was a character that I created.

Kravitz's role in the game was presumably meant to be revealed at tonight's Game Awards, but slipped out early in a now-deleted message posted to the official 007 X account— whoops : \"He rose from nothing, broke free, and built his own Kingdom of Aleph. Introducing Bawma, the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere who's as charismatic as he is unpredictable.\" \"I am sometimes asked: 'Bawma, how is it that you hear every whisper in every corner?'\" Kravtiz croons in Bawma's big reveal, which has also been taken down but remains available for viewing on other, unofficial sites. \"And I answer, 'I have built Aleph with my will, my blood, my whole self.

The whole point of the mode, Blizzard says, is wild, frenetic fun: getting super powerful and collecting every transmog armor appearance, pet, mount, and toy an expansion offers in a short period of time. But the decisions the company makes about the mode, including the most recent update, are often not in support of that goal. Players level up their strength so fast and so far in Remix that they're ridiculously overpowered, tackling even the toughest group content in the game solo, romping through old dungeons and raids as if they were new-player zones. In the current Legion Remix, players are called Timerunners, and the same buff they build up to become OP levelers and fighters also gives them a speed buff—they literally dash everywhere they go. So far, so good. Go fast! But not that fast (Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) But even when the first Mists of Pandaria Remix debuted last year, there were signs of trouble on the horizon.

Case in point, the Zotac Magnus EN mini workstation with RTX 5060 Ti, which seems to power that GPU via the PCIe connector, and not in the same way as Asus BTF cards and motherboards. The mini PC was disassembled and inspected by HKEPC , then brought to my attention by Unikoshardware and Wccftech . Apart from how impressive it is to be able to fit a discrete desktop RTX 5060 Ti into such a small chassis at all, one thing that sticks out is the complete lack of a power cable for the GPU. Looking at GPU-Z shows something interesting: \"Bus interface: PCIe x8 5.0 @ x8 5.0.\" Normally, for an RTX 5060 Ti, it would just show x 5.0. While I'm not sure what the \"@\" is all about, that's basically hinting that the x16 PCIe fingers are split into two batches of x8. And upon closer inspection of the graphics card, it is in fact split in two. As Uniko and Wccf point out, the split-off part gets fed a 19 V input, as they're not being used for…",

The Ayaneo Pocket Play is a smartphone with a sliding display that can be pushed up to reveal a d-pad, AXBY face buttons, and two virtual joystick touchpads. Ayaneo had previously teased this gaming-geared phone early last month . Now, there's a fresh blog post in Ayaneo's typically effusive style about the Pocket Play, plus a Kickstarter page . However, tech specs remain thin on the ground. We don't yet know what processor this bad boy will end up boasting, or even the device's display dimensions. However, given that Ayaneo is known for Android-based gaming handhelds such as the Snapdragon-based Ayaneo Pocket S , perhaps I won't need all three guesses to figure out this phone's headlining hardware specs. So, like most of its ilk, it will likely be an Android device. That means we won't be able to play our precious PC games on it without an emulator, such as Winlator, which is a bit of a job to set up. At least other forms of Android emulation are generally excellent these days. Though there's no gesture at a release window beyond the words 'coming soon,' I'm already intrigued.

Fixing material issues, which meant bullets or arcs' vision weren't blocked by some objects. Patching a gap at the Spaceport Launch Tower, which allowed players to get shot through a wall.

As spotted by Wargamer , you do need to put in a little work here—the card starts off as an un-crashed out Bruce Banner that has to be transformed with six mana. Once he's all green'd up, though, there's a crucial bit of rules text: \"Enrage—Whenever The Incredible Hulk is dealt damage, put a +1/+1 counter on him. If he's attacking, untap him and there is an additional combat phase after this phase.\" Combine this with Caltrops, which deals one damage when a creature attacks, and you start to see the vision: The Hulk crashes into an enemy, roaring, frothing at the mouth. He takes a ste…",

The article is actually a long-form pitch for the company's latest cloud solution, but you won't see that up until right near the end, and until then, it's great for anyone looking to learn more about storage. It guides us through the three main storage types of the last few decades—tape, HDDs, and SSDs—and what causes read/write latency in each solution.

Perhaps it's just hammering home Ashes of Creation is still in its second alpha build and has two beta periods planned before 1.0, whenever that is. You've got less than 24 hours left until Ashes of Creation throws the gates wide open for its early access launch.

The yearly Call of Duty game is such a calcified constant of our hobby that, at some point, the people who used to say \"they should stop making CoD every single year\" just sorta gave up and accepted that series is as inevitable as back pain. We pleaded to Activision to take a break, made our case that the 12-month cycle was unsustainable and diminishing, and Activision responded by doing the exact opposite for going on 20 years. With the sort of \"milk it dry\" hubris that defined the Bobby Kotick era of Activision, the megapublisher decided it could outpace CoD burnout— outrun diminishing returns—by tripling down. More studios, more bodies, more CoD. CoD but battle royale. CoD zombies. CoD extraction. CoD on your phone. CoD but battle royale, but on your phone.

Pilestedt casually wrote in response to an X user pitching his idea for an endless mode (as spotted by GamesRadar ), as if he didn't just spill the beans on what would be the biggest shakeup to Helldivers 2 since launch. Well that's exciting. While most of us haven't taken to social media to tell Arrowhead about it, I imagine lots of fans have also wondered what an endless mode in Helldivers 2 would look like.

This matched my own experience with the game back then. The enticing promise of a full and faithful digital recreation of D&D's 3.5 ruleset—and a chance to throw magic missiles somewhere other than the Sword Coast thanks to the game's use of the Greyhawk setting—was brought down by frustrating technical issues and odd design choices. I was never quite sure if I was doing something wrong or because the game had got its d20s in a twist again, so I quickly decided to stop playing rather than spend hours scouring forums in the hope of finding the right workaround.

When Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley released, I was practically first in line to play, and with the announcement of Moomintroll: Winter's Warmth , I look forward to feeling that excitement all over again whenever it releases. And, after playing an albeit too brief demo, it definitely reminded me why I love these creatures so much. There isn't much of an introduction to the demo, let alone the characters. So, if you're not super familiar with the world of Moomins you might feel a little bit out of your depth, as you're immediately introduced to Moomintroll and the gaggle of Fillyjonks' children. However, you don't really need to know the ins and outs of each character, which is one of the reasons these games are so enjoyable. You also get a feel of the characters through the dialogue alone. As Moomintroll is approached by Fillyjonks' children in the snow, they seem incredibly panicked and are quick to ask for your help. According to them, they'd found a lost dog running about in the snow, but before they …",

The actual number? On Steam, it peaked at just 320, according to SteamDB, a number it only managed to achieve thanks to a free weekend.

The display in question is the snappily-titled ROG Strix 5K XG27JCG , and as the name suggests, its key feature is the 5120 x 2880 IPS panel. Coming in at 27 inches in size, though, that's a lot of pixels being packed in there. Specifically, it's 218 pixels per inch, which is an absurdly high density. Pro creators never really care that much about having a display with high refresh rates, but gamers do. Fortunately, despite its immense pixel density, the ROG Strix 5K still manages to top out at 180 Hz, with FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatible VRR support, all with a grey-to-grey response time of 0.3 milliseconds. Sounds fab, right? Well, a resolution of 5120 x 2880 is 77% more pixels than 4K, so you can well imagine how hard it would be for any GPU to run a game at this level.

Speaking of offerings, Razer is only offering 1,337—uh, huh—units of the Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition. So, if you want one, well, you know what to do. Putting the FOMO aside for a moment, the original Boomslang offered 2,000 DPI mechanical ball tracking (actually, the original-original Boomslang was 1,000 DPI and predates 2005, more on which in a moment) that was ground-breaking at the time. The new model ups that to fully 45,000 DPI, then throws in 8,000 Hz polling and optical switches with claimed 100 million click lifespan for good measure. Oh, and where the OG Boomslang was wired, this reboot is inevitably wireless and comes with what Razer describes as a dock with \"next-gen\" charging.

However, it's worth pointing out now that AMD still doesn't have multi-frame generation, so it's not quite at the same level.

    "body": "In a new blog post, Microsoft says its, \"commitment is to make Windows the best place to game—no matter where you play.\" The company lays out a detailed checklist of all the measures it has taken to make gaming better on the PC in 2025 and name checks a few ideas for the future. It's a substantial roll call. But Windows remains under threat, most obviously from Valve's Steam OS, but also arguably from its own crumminess. Microsoft groups the gaming enhancements it delivered in 2025 into three broad groups: handheld innovation, Windows on Arm, and DirectX. Kicking off with handheld gaming, Microsoft says key improvements include the full screen experience (FSE) that debuted on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally . That's designed to enable a more consistent, \"console-like\" experience while also minimising background tasks for better frame rates. Advanced Shader Delivery (ASD) also debuted on the Xbox Ally. ASD delivers precompiled shaders at install time, eliminating most of the wait time and stuttering when you launch a game for the first time. Microsoft claims the \"numbers speak for themselves\" when it comes to ASD. \"In Avowed, first-run load time dropped by over 80% and Call of Duty: Black O…",

This was a UI bug—turns out that with the \"move\" widget on a lot of homes, there was a hidden vertical arrow that could still be clicked on. You could also fiddle around with moving another object vertically to trick the game into thinking this was the case (you can see YouTuber DiscordianKitty doing so here). Which has, naturally, led to some banger creations. Like this Howl's Moving Castle-esque mecha strider by user Frofidor on the WoW subreddit: Once I knew how to lift the house into the air, I knew I had to give it legs. from r/wow Per a post by community manager Kaivax on the official WoW forums, the dev team made a rapid pivot to decide that, actually, this wasn't a bug—it was a feature: \"Almost immediately after the 11.2.7 patch went live, we saw players using keybinds to elevate houses off the ground, even though there weren’t UI controls for that.

Lunar Lake in tablet form does very, very well, and its Arc 140V GPU is seriously impressive when it comes to gaming performance. And then there's that gorgeous, bright 11-inch display. But it's also flaky as all hell with strange bugs and, despite the whole reason for its existence being that it's supposedly a versatile 3-in-1 device, it resolutely fails to convince in pretty much any of those formats. Like the older, Meteor Lake-powered OneXPlayer X1 , this is a device designed to operate as a standard (although very thick) PC tablet, with a laptop-esque form thanks to its magnetically attaching keyboard and touchpad, and as a handheld gaming PC with a pair of clip-on controllers. And, inevitably, that desire for flexibility hobbles each option in different ways. I was genuinely hoping that things would be different this time around, but it feels like OneXPlayer has not learned the lessons from the original device and is determined to make the same mistakes. Though maybe that quest for versatility means avoiding those mistakes is…",
