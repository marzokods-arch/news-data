Obviously, it's not a full science,\" Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund told GamesBeat. The news triggered all sorts of reactions—some celebrated the idea of being rewarded for peaceful play with peaceful lobbies , others felt like Arc Raiders was penalizing them for enjoying PvP, and some worried their bloody trios matches would poison their solo matchmaking. After the hubbub Embark design lead Virgil Watkins took to setting the record straight in an interview with GamesRadar+ , starting with the label \"aggression-based matchmaking\" itself. Watkins said \"it's a bit of a misnomer calling it aggression-based, and it is something we're going to keep tuning, but people aren't far off in how they think it works.\" As some assumed back …",

Since releasing the game in July 2025, Laine says his attitudes about AI asset generation have changed enough that deleting the game is \"ethically\" the only rational choice.

Originally planned to roll out in December, the DIY microtransactions didn't end up going live until January 9 , immediately after which things started going sideways. Steal the Brainrot, one of the most popular third-party games on Fortnite, moved very quickly to take advantage of the new policy once it went alive, and it was not especially gentle in its approach. As noted by IGN , Steal the Brainrot now offers a \"Present Rot\" bundle for 4,900 V-Bucks—that's $37, if you buy a bundle of 5,000 V-Bucks.

Now, breaking ground on a new fab to actually manufacture memory chips might be a bit beyond the wit of even the most enthusiastic DIY'er. But where there's a will... The modder, who goes by the handle VIK-on, used a pair of 16 GB DDR5 laptop SODIMMs as a starting point. The next step was to source a compatible PCB with the aim of combining all 32 GB onto a single homebrew DIMM. Reportedly, the total cost of the build was $218, about a third of the going rate in Russia for a 32 GB DDR5 stick. Nice. VIK-on also looked into using even cheaper 8 GB sticks to source memory chips, but it seems the chip packaging raises problems when it comes to creating 32 GB sticks.

Notably, the Pulsar Feinman Noctua edition and NF-A12X25 G2 chromax.black have moved from the first quarter (Q1) of 2026 to Q2, and the Antec Flux Pro Noctua edition is now the only product set for release in Q1. The Pulsar Feinmann Noctua Edition, being a neat mouse with a fan in it , intrigued us last year, and a potential launch in Q2 means it will be here in time for the hottest months of the year. From Q2 estimations in the last roadmap, the 140 mm desk fan, USB fan controller and Seasonic Prime PX HPD Noctua edition have all moved back to Q3 this year. If the desk fan is anything like the 120 mm NV-FS1 , it will be pricey and very cool. I can't help but feel like there's a missed opportunity in not launching in the height of the summer, though. However, perhaps the best news in this roadmap update is that the al…",

Created in partnership with Bushiroad and releasing July 30 this year, the Palworld Official Card Game \"is a 2-player competitive card game where you can enjoy strategic and tactical battles through deploying various unique Pals.\" Which, so far you could swap out the word \"Pals\" for \"Pokémon\" and have a perfectly accurate description of the Pokémon TCG. But it is different, I promise. From the blurb, it sounds like basebuilding will form a key part of the whole Palworld Official Card Game experience , much as you can in the videogame. \"Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory. These adorable and dependable Pals will utilize their own unique traits to lead you to victory.\" And that's about all there is to know at this point, though you can watch a video where a bunch of different Pals burst out of playing cards if that appeals.

It'll really depend on which direction Larian swings the needle—D&D's action economy has a heavy reliance on crowd control, given you only have one action per turn (alongside a bonus action and movement).

Huang reflects on the AI naysayers in a recent interview with No Priors (via Business Insider ). The Nvidia leaders and No Priors hosts Elad Gil and Sarah Guo venture down a lot of paths during the nearly 80-minute conversation, including what happens to jobs under an AI future, and when we might see a 'god AI'. One key point is the various narratives around the ethics of the machine learning tech. Huang argues the world of the future is one where AI leads to more jobs: \"People say, 'gosh, all of these robots that we're talking about. It's going to take away jobs'. As we know very clearly, we don't have enough factory workers. Our economy is actually limited by the number of factory workers we have.\" Huang therefore argues that robotics will lead to a huge repair industry, and that will naturally lead to more jobs.

Even after all this time, it's safe to say that there are a lot of people eager to check out what this crack team of Minecraft modders has been up to. Below I'll go over the Hytale launch times in your region so you know if you need to book the day off work or call in sick. When is the Hytale unlock time? Based on the official countdown , Hytale launches at 7 am PST on Tuesday, January 13 , finally letting everyone get their hands on the game after seven long years of waiting. It launches simultaneously across all regions (and there's no advanced access). Here are the full Hytale unlock times for major time zones across the globe: Pacific: 7 am PST Eastern: 10 am EST UK: 3 pm GMT Europe: 4 pm CET Australia: 2 am AEDT (Wednesday, January 14) New Zealand: 4 am NZDT (Wednesday, January 14) Since Hytale's not available on Steam durin…",

As we understand it, somebody at the CES show rifled through the driver files of a laptop demo'ing Intel's new Core Ultra Series 3 chip and found references to the increasingly mythical G31 GPU .

It could be that Intel has never been planning to release such a GPU for the consumer market, and all of these rumours and leaks are for nought. But if the B770 is real, why didn't it appear at CES?

Even then Anthem had its diehards, and the patches and updates that followed addressed some of its more significant flaws. Not enough to save it unfortunately, but enough to guarantee a small but dedicated community of Freelancers who have suited up and returned to Fort Tarsis for the final day before EA pulls the plug on Anthem for good .

For instance, Hypixel Studios founder and CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme just showed off a brief snippet of a custom game on X . Far from the first-person survival fare you might expect, it's a 2D side-scroller with impressive set dressing.

Various reasons have been aired for these problems, ranging from overeager profit chasing, to mismanagement and the malign influence of private equity, alongside broader market influences like audiences playing fewer new games . But former Assassin's Creed director Alexandre Amancio thinks the problems are more fundamental than these influences. Indeed, he believes they go right to the heart of how gaming's biggest studios are currently structured.

It seems Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse are keen to maintain that momentum in 2026. In a Steam update , Hooded Horse's CEO Tim Bender provided a detailed rundown of what's coming to the management sim this year. The most immediate planned change is a new upgrade level for the Burgage Plot—Manor Lords' basic homestead that can be expanded and tailored to a variety of uses. Burgage plots currently have three upgrade levels, but Slavic Magic is adding a new level, which exists between 2 and 3. \"Its goal is to more smoothly bridge the gap between early and late-game housing\", Bender explains. Alongside this, Slavic Magic is also considering shifting certain workshop progressions to later in the game, tying baker extensions to level 3 Burgage Plots to encourage use of the early-game communal oven, and also doing the same with cobbler ext…",

Still, things seem to have gotten much worse in recent years, and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain took to his YouTube channel Friday to discuss the issue of \"arguing about games\" at length . \"People have always had different tastes and they wanted different things,\" Cain said in the video. \"I think each one of you, individually, knows what you want. Where things break down is, you don't seem to realize or recognize that there's a lot of other people out there and they all want different things. And this isn't just gamers, developers do this too.\" Cain acknowledged there's no right way to make a game; disagreements over how to properly optimize a game, what features do and don't belong, and so on all come up during the dev cycle and years after a game has released. An example he gives in the video is RPG romance. Whether you loved or hated how horny Baldur's Gate 3 was, it's clear that romanceable party companions are as popular as they are polarizing—and Cain said he's been pressured to include them even though they aren't to his taste.

As Gamesradar noted in its report on this, there's a video on YouTube where games marketing consultant Chris Zukowski talks about Valve's coveted \"chocolate tier\": a special class of studios that, once they get up to around $800,000 in annual revenue, receive a box of fancy chocolates as a gift from Valve at the end of the year. That Gamesradar article mentions an interview Game File (readers may encounter a paywall) conducted with Peak developer Aggro Crab. Co-founder Nick Kaman confirmed Aggro Crab has been itching to join the chocolate-chowing inner circle since it released Another Crab's Treasure , its most successful game before Peak. The team didn't receive a gift from Valve in 2024 despite pulling in the right amount of cash from that game, which stung; when Kaman emailed Valve about it, he got an apology.

That being said, I have bad news, #SlorkNation: Valve has melted Slork's wet, slippery body into Sunday dinner. Let me back up. Slork was a hero concept first accessible via console commands in Deadlock's private test. He was later added to the hero labs, a feature where characters with placeholder art could be used to queue up for normal games during scheduled hours, assuming you had a certain number of games under your belt. At this point, Slork had been renamed to the decidedly less hilarious Fathom. Deadlock has spent the last year shifting forms like the MOBA version of an Animorph, and the hero labs mode was removed as the game became increasingly polished and all play was subsumed into a single ranked queue. Four of the eight hero labs characters were added to Deadlock's core roster permanently. The others, including Fathom, were simply removed.

This problem came to a head last year, with Riot promising to cut back on supplementary utility powers to reorient Valorant back around gunplay. This initiative is set to continue through 2026, with Valorant's latest patch introducing a new gun as Riot promises more extensive weapon reworks in the future. That new gun is called the Bandit, a semiautomatic pistol designed to fill the gap between the silenced Ghost and Valorant's high-powered revolver, the Sheriff. The Bandit gives players a higher rate of fire than the Sheriff and superior damage compared to the Ghost, able to deal instant kills on headshots against lightly armoured players. Riot believes this should add some extra spice to those early, pistol-heavy rounds.

Roberts left the company shortly after the buyout—though he remained involved with Freelancer as a creative consultant. Freelancer eventually released in 2003, more than three years later than originally planned. Its cinematic, arcade space combat was generally well liked. But the game was also criticised for being simplistic compared to other space sims—a consequence of Microsoft scaling down the project following their acquisition of Digital Anvil.

    "body": "We all save scummed in Baldur's Gate 3⁠—except, apparently, for my friend Jack and coworker Morgan Park. They both accidentally killed everyone at the Last Light Inn and just kept trucking. As part of Larian's big Divinity AMA on Reddit , the game's writing director, Adam Smith, revealed how the studio is factoring players' save scumming tendencies into its next game's design. For a quick definition, I think \"save scumming\" is best understood as using a game's save/load feature for anything other than quitting the game and coming back later, or continuing from a game over⁠—no moral judgement here, mind you, just an observation of our tendencies. The incentive to save scum could be argued to be a design failure, or merely a natural function of games as wish fulfillment. We already have to live with our mistakes in real life, why do so in our fantasies? Comment from r/Games The big Baldur's Gate 3 example has to be quickloading every time you fail a skill check until the 20-sided dice finally lands your way. But for RPGs that are all about choice and consequence, this ever present temptation to never have to live with failure can adulterate some of a game's chew , removing stakes fr…",

    "body": "League of Legends looks unrecognizable in 2025 when compared to its cartoonier, humbler 2009 incarnation. And yet, while Summoner's Rift has been dotted with all sorts of new jungle monsters, balance tweaks, and visual overhauls, the actual map has changed only slightly. Occasionally a different mode is introduced with a new map, but those rarely receive much support—League has been focused on refining a single map and mode of play for nearly two decades now. Dota gets a little sillier —okay, a lot sillier —and Heroes of the Storm prioritizes breadth over depth with all sorts of smaller maps, but the average MOBA feels familiar each time you return. Three lanes, kill creeps for gold, buy a consistent number of powerful items, try not to pass out from sheer anger when it all goes wrong. Valve's Deadlock , on the other hand, has spent the last year rocking the boat frequently with no warning or restraint. Where other MOBAs are happy to get a new hero a few times a year with the very occasional dual release , Deadlock shows off six in one go and lets players tear each other apart over, er, voting for, which gets added first. The community went feral campaigning for their favorites . …",
