    "body": "I spent a good chunk of my October telling anyone who'd listen to play Silent Hill f , even if they weren't horror fans, the game was just too good to go unplayed. Convincing co-workers, friends, and strangers wasn't too difficult until I'd mention the NG+ endings. Understandably, the idea of having to play through multiple iterations of a game to fully complete it was intimidating, and many people I talked to just didn't have the time for it. Aside from offering to play it through for them so they could just sit back and watch or promising that it didn't feel like a slog when you're actually embroiled in the story of Silent Hill f there wasn't a whole lot I could do to convince them, until now. (Image credit: Future) A new patch for Silent Hill f just dropped, and with it comes a multitude of ways in which developer NeoBards makes it easier for players to get through all the NG+ endings. \"Thank you to all Silent Hill f players for your patience,\" Al Yang, director of Silent Hill f says in a social media post . \"Today we've released a patch that adds a new casual difficulty and addresses feedback we've received, including reducing the amount of forced combat areas, speeding up NG+…",

Designed in collaboration with Issey Miyake, a brand based around the works of a late fashion designer of the same name, the iPhone Pocket is, Apple proudly declares, \"born from the idea of creating an additional pocket\". Revolutionary stuff. It's also been inspired by the concept of \"a piece of cloth\", which is fairly obvious to see, as that's exactly what it looks like (via BBC News ). The long strap version has also been priced at $230 , a figure that has drawn much ire and ridicule from the online community. Quelle surprise, etc, etc. The iPhone pocket everybody. $230 for a cut up sock. Apple people will pay anything for anything as long as it’s Apple. pic.twitter.com/wRtQKBzoqt November 12, 2025 Some have made the comparison with wearing a sock around your neck , which in and of itself feels like something you might see on a runway near you as a bold new imagining of the paradigm of footwear.

If you're out of the loop, Stella Montis is a brand-new map that releases whenever we've pooled enough materials together to complete this stage. While contributing to the community's efforts in unlocking the map is the main goal, of course, it's not selfish to consider the fact that you also earn Merits for donating materials. Merits are an event currency that you'll be able to spend on a new reward track in the next phase of the community event, once the Stella Montis map is actually available. Not only did these donations not put a single dent in my stash, but I also didn't even have to play the game; I just clicked 45 times on the main menu. The crucial part is that the maximum amount of Merits you can earn (during this phase, at least) is 900, so you'll have completed your personal contribution after donating 225 materials. In other words, just 45 clicks, or 46 if you're counting the button to open the event page. I imagine this is where most players still stop contributing to the event, unless they've got an overflowing stash and…",

Located in the strap of the Steam Frame, on the front of the Steam Machine, and beneath the screen on the Steam Deck , this microSD card slot allows for easy transfers of games between devices. According to Valve, it's simply plug and play. If you have a bunch of games installed on your Steam Deck's card and you plug that into the Steam Machine, voila, all your games are now available there. \"You can take your catalogue from your Steam Deck or from your Steam Machine, and they're fully interoperable, so you can plug it in here and just bring it along with you,\" Jeremy Selan, an engineer on the Steam Frame, says. All three devices support up to 2 TB of SDXC storage via the microSD card slot, and Valve tells me that game performance is good enough even from the compact storage medium. \"We think you get a really good experience with SD cards.

Alongside that, I'll also go over Black Ops 7 pre-load details so you don't have to sit there for hours on launch day like a chump. All that said, here's the Black Ops 7 release time for each region so you know when you can start playing. Black Ops 7 release date and time for each region (Image credit: Activision) Black Ops 7 launches on Friday, November 14 , in most territories, though it'll actually be Thursday, November 13, on the West Coast.

Similar to the mainline games, the objective is to take down the machines, but this time you'll do so as a fully customizable \"machine hunter\" in an open world inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. Curiously, Steel Frontiers is confirmed for PC, Android, and iOS but not PS5, though as Guerilla Games' Jan-Bart van Beek mentions in the video embedded above, it has been \"built specifically for mobile\".

Based on the footage, Steel Frontiers looks pretty good for a mobile game, though that depends on whether you think the Horizon series in general looks good. There are few obvious compromises made when it comes to the equally lush and decrepit open world, and the mechanical beasties look as ornate as usual. Some loose things I can glean from the video footage: there are mounts, both flyable and grounded. You can leap from your mount onto a Tallnec…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I think we can all agree on this statement: Dogs . Dogs are great, and it's a scientifically proven fact that any game can be improved by a factor of 90% by simply adding a dog to it—and that rises to 99% when you can pet that dog. But how well do you know our loyal, four-legged friends? If you saw 10 different dogs from 10 different games, do you think you could tell me their names, or at least the games you know them from? In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a dog, and all you have to do is type in its name. To make things a bit easier, you can guess either the name of the dog or the name of the game . So, if you can't quite remember a dog's name, you can still make a guess about what game they're from. Sink your teeth into this quiz, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

But is this some sort of clever scheme by Valve to drum up support or test out the popularity of ideas on dedicated fans? No, apparently not. That's right from the horse's mouth, too, and if you take this as further proof of some sort of grand plan, I have a bridge to sell you.

This uses two cameras embedded just above the wearer's eyes, through which Valve can very quickly monitor where a user is looking at any one time.

Congrats on today's announce.\" Maybe it's just me, but I feel a certain coldness behind Spencer's message, which featured not a single enthusiastic exclamation point. It's understandable, I suppose, because he's in a tough spot right now. After being thoroughly trounced by Sony—\" Halo on PlayStation \" is the whitest flag I've ever seen flo…",

However, it's also a sign that times are changing, as systems running on Arm are receiving much greater support from Valve. Valve has been largely focused on x86 processors over the years. These chips from AMD and Intel are the dominant player in PC gaming, so it only makes sense as to why. But in recent months, Arm support is seeping into Steam in a variety of ways. SteamOS will receive Arm support with the launch of the Steam Frame sometime next year. I don't suspect you'll be able to take that ISO file and load it onto any old Arm-based device right away, like a modern mobile phone, and have it just work. It's still not possible to stick SteamOS on any gaming PC and have it just work, but it is improving in that regard. The chip powering the Steam Frame isn't unique to the headset, however.

But its return to modern-military gunplay with a big lick of destruction won over even the most cynical of multiplayer FPS heads. But then its battle royale mode Redsec came out, and the live-service gears shrieked into motion with a disappointing new map and weekly challenges that mandated battle royale play, putting a decisive end to Battlefield 6's honeymoon period. With BF Studios rushing to quell these issues as Steam reviews drop to Mixed, Battlefield 6's developers have also addressed the situation. Speaking to IGN , design director Justin Wiebe assured players that the studio is \"always listening\". \"As soon as the game launched, we had people kind of looking at all forms of player communication, and taking notes and saying, ‘OK, well, we had planned to do this in live service, but we're hearing that this is a problem for the community',\" Wiebe explained. \"If it's a problem for the community, then let's talk about it. Let's see how we can prioritize that.\" Wiebe also discussed BF Studios' approach to responding to issues brought…",

This isn't the Valve Index 2, it's something quite different, but it should still appeal to hardcore VR users and new users alike. The Steam Frame is a standalone VR headset. It doesn't require a PC in order to play games or watch videos in VR. It doesn't need base stations or a cable, either. It's powered by SteamOS, Valve's own Linux distro used on the Steam Deck , and an Arm chip. So, what makes this a PCVR headset again? \"We see Steam Frame as a streaming first headset,\" Lawrence Yang, a designer at Valve, tells me. Streaming in this context does not refer to cloud streaming or showcasing your skills on Twitch. Rather streaming means playing a game on a gaming PC and streaming it over to the Steam Frame via a wireless connection. So, you're streaming the game from one PC to another PC on your head, without using any cables. The Steam Frame includes a wireless adapter that plugs in via USB to a host PC, which can be any PC capable of running Steam and playing VR games. This wir…",

The idea behind the Steam Controller is that it allows you to interact with your PC while on your sofa or away from a desk with the accuracy of a mouse, without actually requiring one. This is, and always has been, a good idea. Where people differ is on whether the original manifestation of the Steam Controller, first released in 2015, was any good or not. I never used it for long enough to get to grips with it—which was, in large part, the problem with it. Some here at PC Gamer own the controller, but rarely, if ever, used it. Others here actively despise it. I imagine that represents a pretty good cross section of the wider PC gaming community.

    "body": "The latest in the series of era-obsessed city builders, Anno 117: Pax Romana , launches today on PC and consoles. There's plenty of toga cosplay to go around as you slip into the sandals of a Roman governor at the peak of the empire, managing the needs of your people against the demands of the emperor. There's more of a narrative going on in Anno 117 than your average city builder as well, which is a nice touch. Our Anno 117: Pax Romana review says, \"At times it borders on so friendly and non-threatening to your endeavours that you feel like you could leave it unattended for an hour and return to find everything absolutely fine. At others, the sequence of events required to tick off the next chapter objective feels so long and incremental that you wonder if you’ll achieve anything at all of note this evening with it.\" When is the Anno 117 unlock time? (Image credit: Ubisoft) On PC, the Anno 117 launch time is 3 pm Pacific on Wednesday, November 12, 2025 . On consoles, Anno 117 unlocks at midnight in your local time zone on Thursday, November 13. You can find Anno 117 on Steam and the Epic Games Store for $60/£50, or the Ubisoft Store , where it's also available through Ubisoft+. H…",

Today's patch, which kicks off the roadmap schedule, includes some welcome polish: a save on exit feature, a crash fix, and two dozen or so assorted bug fixes. The rest of the roadmap stretches beyond a Christmas-themed winter update and into next year, though it's a little light on details; there's a Valentine's Day update, and two DLCs due for the latter part of 2026.

Like Rockstar's 2006 game, Agefield High is set in a school campus and a surrounding slice of open-ended suburbia, with a day/night cycle and a school itinerary you can choose to follow or flaunt.
