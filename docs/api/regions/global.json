The probe was originally launched on May 21, 2010, after famously being decorated with some 13,000 Hatsune Miku drawings and messages submitted by fans. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) sent the probe next door to Venus to study the planet's weather patterns and look for \"signs of active volcanism.\" The probe also captured some stunning images of Venus that show the milky coffee hues of its atmosphere. JAXA reported that it lost contact with the probe in April 2024 and operations were officially terminated on Thursday. Akatsuki was the only operational probe specifically focused on studying Venus over the past ten years. The Akatsuki team announced the shut down in a post on X (formerly Twitter) , as translated by Automaton: \"We have concluded operations of the Venus probe Akatsuki. Since last year we have been attempting to restore communications, but determined that recovery would be difficult, and so we have drawn this chapter to a close.

A good, deep D&D adventure as I imagined them to be—basically Mazes and Monsters , minus the moral panic psychosis—was out of reach. The first Baldur's Gate changed all that, with great dungeons, an epic quest, and most important of all, a deep cast of characters with their own thoughts, beliefs, and personalities—and who, just like in the real world, would sometimes gel or clash with their fellows in unexpected ways. Some became fast friends, others would try to literally murder each other, and a handful would just throw their hands up in disgust at my obvious incompetence and leave, after giving me a good telling-off of course. Baldur's Gate 2 raised the stakes with a more focused cast and wider range of interpersonal possibilities, plus an unpleasant kickoff that reminded me just how much these characters meant.

After Boaty McBoatface was renamed the RSS Sir David Attenborough back in 2018 in a historic moment of \"stop having fun, guys,\" it's nice to see this vote go with the people's choice. Now Ctrl Alt Deleaf will be bravely leading the charge to keep the UK's railways clear of leaves this fall. Among the other equally silly names in the running were \"Leaf-Fall Weapon,\" \"Pulp Friction,\" and the \"Autumn Avenger.\" Despite that competition, \"Ctrl Alt Deleaf\" won with a commanding 50% of the vote. The finalist names that went up for a public vote were selected from a pool of over a thousand by railway historian and British TV host Tim Dunn, along with the UK's rail minister Lord Hendy and Lisa Angus, Network Rail's Weather Response Director. In a press release announcing the winning name for the latest leaf cleaning train, Angus commented, \"Our leaf-busting trains are the unsung heroes of the British autumn travelling the length and breadth of the country to keep the railway running.\" Ctrl Alt Deleaf is the most accurate name among the finalists, in my humble …",

The terms of the settlement and the amount haven’t been announced yet (and it’s likely the amount won’t be publicly revealed), but an order of dismissal for the case was also filed on Monday after the settlement. The Internet Archive team hasn’t said much, either, only offering a short update on its blog stating, “The parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.” It’s the end to a case that was originally filed back in 2023 and marks yet another clash between copyright protection and content preservation. The “Great 78 Project” at the heart of the case aimed to digitize and preserve 78 rpm shellac records , or “78s”, which were made roughly from 1898 through the 1950s. They were basically the precursor to vinyl. So, this wasn’t m…",

It's a very good game, actually: a plane-hopping, swashbuckling, high-fantasy adventure filled with great performances and memorable characters. But that's not quite enough explanation, is it? There have been a lot of very good games in the past few decades, and not all of them get anniversary write-ups. Heck, personally I'm more of a Baldur's Gate 1 guy, and yet I don't think I said a thing when that game's 25-year anniversary hit two years ago. It's because Baldur's Gate 2 is a lot more than just Baldur's Gate 2. It represents BioWare hitting on an approach to design that would define it—and consequently, so much other RPG development—for over a decade afterwards. BioWare never stopped making Baldur's Gate 2 once it made it the first time.

My quickfire take is that it isn't as good as Human Fall Flat , but better than Totally Reliable Delivery Service and way less cursed than Roblox . At least, those were my thoughts before the 1.0 update , which expands Wobbly Life quite a bit . The launch version basically adds a second open world to the game, if you can consider outer flipping space a world, that is. Wobbly Life's cosmic expanse adds a host of celestial bodies and manmade structures for you to explore, from moons to hop around on to an elaborate station built into the side of an asteroid. These locations also afford new opportunities to earn cash.

In 1998, Baldur's Gate redefined what a computer RPG – and videogame interpretation of the D&D ruleset – could be. Just two years later, Baldur's Gate 2 expanded on it so much that development nearly ballooned out of control. This is the story of one of the most influential and ambitious RPGs ever made. Many of the great RPGs are etched into the popular imagination by their beginnings, those tentative first steps in a new fantasy world that tease the vastness ahead, and the freedom to carve your own path through it. The first steps into Baldur's Gate 2's world are one of those moments. After a tough opening sequence that sees you escaping captivity from the wizard Irenicus, you emerge into Waukeen's Promenade, the trading hub of Amn's central city of Athkatla. Surrounded by golden minarets, it's a bustling amphitheater of traders and thieves, wealthy and poor – a filthy and vibrant snapshot of urban plenitude.

Now, it seems the community is generally fed up with the increasingly buggy state of the base game, with EA revealing plans for two solid months dedicated to bugfixes and quality-of-life support. \"We see your feedback on technical issues and game performance. And we want to assure you that your concerns are heard,\" the publisher wrote in a post on Monday . \"Over the next 8 weeks, our dedicated teams will dive in to resolve current issues and get ahead of unforeseen technical disruptions.\" Those plans kicked off in earnest with a big update to the base game that arrived late on Thursday. The headline feature of this patch was a newly added playpark for kids to run themselves ragged on, as well as a 'play pretend' interaction for kids who presumably can't get to said playpark for whatever reason. The update also adds a prototype \"memory boost\" feature to eke some extra performance from your PC, though you'll need to opt into this in the game s…",

Luckily, I'm able to postpone starting a degree in medieval history just so I can drop 'fief' into conversation more often without coming off as a total weirdo, because feudal estates happen to be the focus of Wartales ' newest DLC. Wartales, for those unaware, is a low-fantasy RPG where you control a band of mercenaries. At a glance it looks ferociously boring, but as I discovered in my Wartales review , it proved a surprisingly capable story engine laced with gripping turn-based tactical combat. Wartales has received consistent updates—both free and paid—since it launched in 2023, but its latest expansion is apparently the one fans have been anticipating most heavily. \"Since the early days of Wartales' early access, one request has consistently stood out from the community: owning and managing a fief,\" writes developer Shiro games in a recent Steam post . \"With our upcoming DLC, Contract: The Fief , we're finally bringing that vision to life.\" The Fief adds a more strategic layer to Wa…",

ColePowered Games' sleuthing simulator procedurally generates an entire city's worth of crimes to solve, somehow creating genuine deduction puzzles out of a bucketful of random numbers. Granted, it also tends to create a lot of bugs and dead ends in the process. But when Shadows of Doubt works, it's one of the best games ever made. Yet the latest update somehow makes Shadows of Doubt even more conceptually appealing, by letting you play as a detective who is also a rat. The modifiers update injects a bunch of optional mutations into the sim's algorithmic genes, one of which lets you prowl its rain-slicked alleys as a trenchcoat-wearing rodent. Simply titled \"rat detective\", the modifier shrinks your character down to a mere 10cm tall, letting you experience the powers and perils of being a city-dwelling rodent. The advantage of being a rat detective is you can climb on walls and ceilings, and sneak past people more easily. The downside is that you can't question people, and citizens may even be hostile to your presence. I gave the rat detective …",

It has that same autumnal vibe as RE4, these dark forests and abandoned townships calling to mind the ones I explored in Spain a lonely and rural part of Europe.

As the name suggests, it’s a gaming-specific version of Copilot that Microsoft calls “your personal gaming sidekick.” You can use Gaming Copilot to ask for tips, suggestions, summaries, info on achievements, and the like. It can analyze what’s on your screen for context, such as identifying an NPC you’re talking to (although their names are usually on screen anyway). You’re able to access this assistant directly through the Xbox Game Bar⁠—by default, pressing Windows+G on a keyboard or the Xbox button on one of the company's controllers. There’s also a voice mode and a \"mini mode\" for pinning the AI to your screen. While I can see how some gamers might find this useful, it's hard to see how it's more than an AI version of simply pulling up a guide on your phone or via the Steam browser.

Terminally Online This is Terminally Online: PC Gamer's very own MMORPG column, and I am not Harvey Randall, your usual author. I'm Joshua Wolens, filling in for Harvey this week with a lot of wistful, misty-eyed old-man musings about the glory of the MUDs of yore. Look away and look back to the last time anything was good: the '90s, when the internet moved too slow to cook your brain and the absolute peak of graphical fidelity was translucent water and the PlayStation 1, whose vertices swam and staggered beneath their own raw aesthetic power. Back then, if you wanted a world—a real world—there was only one place to go: Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs). And frankly, my contention is that for all our modern graphical horsepower, that's still the case. Sacred texts MUDs, if you're not familiar, are large, shared, entirely text-based world…",

That glitch and some much-needed quality-of-life tweaks are getting addressed in an upcoming patch Bandai Namco announced on Friday. Along with a fix for the Depth level increase bug, this patch will also give you an option to voluntarily decrease your Depth level and add Depth level demotion protection for level three onward. You gain points toward promotion for winning runs, and lose points when you fail, meaning it's possible to be demoted, similar to competitive multiplayer ranks in other games. This new protection feature effectively gives you a second chance to hang on when you would otherwise get demoted starting at Depth level three. You then get two extra chances for levels four and five each. Lastly, this patch will also allow Steam players to return to an ongoing session if they get disconnected due to Steam server issues. The voluntary demotion, meanwhile, lets you turn down the heat if you need more practice or want to better accommodate lower-ranked friends. If you've tried the new Deep o…",

Madness' fast-paced, hyper-violent shorts involve grey, cross-faced people blasting each other to smithereens. Central to the series' appeal was how its action scenes grew more impressive and elaborate with every passing episode, and it was always fun to see how far Krinkels could push things when a new entry dropped. I haven't thought about Madness for a long time (though the series hasn't gone away, as I'll get to shortly). But those memories came flooding back when I spied Somewhere in Hell , a Doom 2 mod that goes to impressive lengths to recreate Madness' flashy, bloody action in id Software's shooter sequel. Somewhere in Hell basically replaces Doom's weapons and enemies with goons and firearms from Krinkels' animations.

For those unfamiliar with the art of medieval beermaking, Ale Abbey tasks players with founding a monastery in a boozy slice of Middle-Ages Europe, transforming it into the finest monkish brewery in Christendom. Your Fermentine order is founded on familiar management-sim mechanics, like building new rooms for your monastery, recruiting new brothers and sisters, and maintaining their general health and happiness.

Instead of making pre-set beers, you create your own beverage through choosing a style of ale, picking what equipment you'll use to brew it, and adjusting variables like the quality and quantity of your grain, the temperature of your mash, and how long you choose to age it once barrelled.

It's easily one of my favorite games, but if you're not into the story as it stands, then the MMORPG isn't worth it. I will, however, show you this freakishly adorable baby Seikret minion revealed with the collab rewards and walk away. Whatever happens after is not my business. The baby Seikret (along with a Vigorwasp minion) is headed to the MMORPG in October when FF14 kicks off its collaboration with Monster Hunter Wilds. I know some of you are disappointed it's not a Palico, and I get it; they're cute. But we already got one when Rathalos landed in Stormblood's crossover with Monster Hunter: World, and you can still unlock the Palico (or Poogie) to this day. Anyway, look at this guy. An absolutely useless, flightless little chunk of a bird with not a thought behind those eyes. I'll fight Arkveld all by myself to get one. Computer, enhance.

The kids are with us! But the kids aren't necessarily playing the kinds of games I grew up on: You may have heard of that excruciatingly popular platform called Roblox where kids are pressured to spend their parents' money in games like \"Steal a Brainrot.\" (Which, to be fair, does sound like something you'd find on Newgrounds circa 2000, so maybe we're not all that different.) Earlier this week, I spoke to Newzoo director of market intelligence Emmanuel Rosier about what young gamers are up to, and two aspects of his perspective stuck out to me the most: Gen Alpha doesn't care if it can run Crysis.

It can be upgraded, too, which makes it more effective and able to latch onto enemies, pull them toward you, and knock them down. Unfortunately I can't just point you to a spot on the map like I did with the Dying Light: The Beast's Sawblade Launcher , because the grappling hook is a reward for completing a story quest, and it's a quest you probably won't advance to until you're a little more than halfway through the game. If you simply don't want to wait, you can rush through the story quests one right after another, but I would recommend doing at least a few sidequests along the way, too.

Miskatonic U. faculty were some of Howard Philips Lovecraft's favorite guys to drive cuckoo, you see.

Even at the height of a 2,000+ hour, multi-year relationship with Rainbow Six Siege, I still regularly played some Call of Duty and Overwatch with friends. That lack of focus probably explains why I was good but never great at Siege, but it's all part of a healthy FPS rotation. That's a thing we all have, right? A handful of shooters we bounce between throughout the year? Maybe you do it for your favorite singleplayer campaigns, or perhaps it's not even a conscious exercise, but it's natural to ebb and flow between familiar shooters that scratch different itches. Earlier this year, I started keeping track of my FPS rotation. I used Backloggd —a journaling site that's basically Letterboxd for games—to make a living list of the shooters I'm always playing, but never at the same time. Right now, my FPS rotation is at 10.

He was so big that in 2020 Epic added Ninja skins to the game. These days Blevin is still huge: the third most-popular streamer on Twitch, with over 67 million followers across platforms. But those kinds of numbers are now beyond him (or most anyone), and elements of the internet won't let him forget it. Blevins says every time he streams the \"haters\" are straight in to \"berate\" him for his lower viewership numbers: \"I think I'm the only streamer on the planet who was pulling 100,000 viewers [per stream] consistently, but now I get like seven or eight thousand across Twitch and YouTube,\" said Blevins. \"So that's somet…",

Your oddly specific prayers have finally been answered, because nearly 30 years after the discovery of the cursed Pandora's Box-like artifact known as Bop It!—which demanded its user perform ritualistic bopping, twisting, and pulling of its button, knob, and handle in the precise pattern needed to finally release the prophesied Loud One, known as Bophomet, upon the world to reign for all time—is now a videogame.

Playing through a new hands-on demo showing off more of its dark vision of Seattle, I'm struck by how much it nails the atmosphere of the original tabletop RPG. If you were a goth kid in the '90s, you are going to feel completely at home. Between two preview builds, I've now played about three hours of Bloodlines 2, and in terms of its authenticity, I'm sold. From the moonlit streets, to the moody fashion, to the derelict mansions and art deco apartments, it couldn't feel more like a world where sexy-cool vampires would be at home. And there's no shyness about taking the tabletop lore seriously—concepts like the Camarilla and the Masquerade aren't just background, they're core to the story. (Image credit: Paradox Interactive) It can feel a bit like Proper Noun Overload, and there is something inherently stuffy about a lot of the bloodsucker politics. But that's punctured nicely by the two playable characters—Phyre, an ancient vampire awoken from over hundred years of slumber, and Fabien, a disembodied 1940s vampire detective who lives in their head (for slightly tangled reaso…",

Of course, you ideally need a beefy graphics card to game at 4K and certainly for today's big releases with spangly ray-traced visuals. But what if you don't have one but still need a big, high-resolution screen for work? Well, you can just run your games at 1080p, but then it'll look all blurry. One solution is the current in-thing in the world of displays: dual-mode monitors. These are natively 4K in resolution but, at the touch of a button, they switch to 1080p. To counter the inherent blurring this normally produces, manufacturers employ a host of clever pixel blending tricks, and our current recommendation for the best 4K dual-mode monitor, the Alienware AW2725QF , does a very good job of it all.

Included in this drop are over 10 million people leaving the PC platform entirely.

The idea being, if you bring together both companies' tech, it's possible to deliver something more flexible, more desirable than either company can deliver on its own. The benefits for the two companies are clear enough. Nvidia needs processors for GPU-accelerated server racks, and despite its best efforts to buy Arm, that fell through, dashing any hope of becoming a fully-integrated hardware company with it. Intel needs a helping hand in a few ways. The company is struggling with a falling share price and recently struck a deal with the US government to buy a share of the business, and getting an in with one of the richest companies on the planet isn't a bad get. Though supercharging its processors with more capable and powerful graphics chips has a few big benefits, too.

The announcement also broke the news of a $5 billion investment by Nvidia into Intel's common stock, at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. According to sources speaking to The New York Times , the Trump administration approached Nvidia in January and asked it to invest in the chipmaker. The US government has since made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel itself, which is now estimated to be worth $13 billion as a result of Intel's share price rising by near 23% off the back of yesterday's news.
