In his native Chile, Fabrizio Copano hosts his own late-night show; I’m From the Future is his first English-language special and includes the story of how he fell in love with a woman from Texas in Mexico City and ended up driving a U-Haul full of furniture (and a Mexican dog) across the border to New York City. Beth Stelling lives on the other side of the country, in Los Angeles, and&nbsp; The Landlord Special &nbsp;will put whatever housing woes you have in perspective. Barbosa (single) and Jefferies (married with kids) both have insights to share on matters of the heart, with&nbsp;Jefferies digging in not just on his marriage and that of his parents, but the whole institution: &#8220;My mother never lived long enough to see my father happy—she missed out on it by a couple of days.”&nbsp;As for Ken Flores, his must-see half-hour&nbsp;— part of the LOL!

The K-pop star shared a post on her Instagram today, Sept. 4 , accompanied by the caption, &ldquo;Some sleepless nights.&rdquo; The post featured a short and sweet carousel of photos of the &ldquo;Money&rdquo; singer in Japan, grabbing sushi and showing off her outfit. What drew us to the post, beyond Lisa&rsquo;s obvious sense of style, was her bag charm. View this post on Instagram A post shared by LISA (@lalalalisa_m) While Lisa is clearly a lover of Labubus (she basically started the craze), the Thai star was seen swapping out the monster doll for a fluffier Monchhichi keychain. The vibrant yellow doll was fixed to what looked like a Louis Vuitton P9 series bag in red with tan straps and monogrammed detailing throughout.

    "body": "6 Min Read Upcoming Launch to Boost NASA’s Study of Sun’s Influence Across Space Soon, there will be three new ways to study the Sun’s influence across the solar system with the launch of a trio of NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spacecraft. Expected to launch no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 23, the missions include NASA’s IMAP (Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe), NASA’s Carruthers Geocorona Observatory, and NOAA’s SWFO-L1 (Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1) spacecraft. The three missions will launch together aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. From there, the spacecraft will travel together to their destination at the first Earth-Sun Lagrange point (L1), around one million miles from Earth toward the Sun. The missions will each focus on different effects of the solar wind — the continuous stream of particles emitted by the Sun — and space weather — the changing conditions in space driven by the Sun — from their origins at the Sun to their farthest reaches billions of miles away at the edge of our solar system. Research and observations from the missions will help us better understand the Sun’s infl…",

The Rock and Roll with NASA Challenge seeks that breakthrough. If you can imagine a lightweight, compliant wheel that stays tough at higher speeds while carrying lots of&nbsp; cargo, your ideas could set the pace for surface missions to follow. For this phased Challenge, Phase 1 rewards the best concepts and analyses, Phase 2 funds prototypes, and Phase 3 puts the best wheels through a live obstacle course simulating the lunar terrain. Along the way, you’ll receive feedback from NASA mobility engineers and the chance to see your hardware pushed to its limits.&nbsp; In Phase 3, to prove concepts, NASA is using MicroChariot, a nimble, 45 kg test rover that will test the best designs from Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2 at the Johnson Space Center Rockyard in Houston, Texas. Whether you’re a student team, a garage inventor, or a seasoned aerospace firm, this is your opportunity to rewrite the playbook of planetary mobility and leave tread marks on the future of exploration.

A 20-year NASA veteran, Kshatriya was most recently the deputy in charge of the Moon to Mars Program in the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate (ESDMD) at NASA Headquarters in Washington. In this role, Kshatriya was responsible for program planning and implementation for crewed missions to the Moon through the Artemis campaign in preparation for humanity’s first mission to Mars. Promoting Kshatriya to NASA’s top ranks puts America’s return to the Moon through Artemis at the very core of our agency. The move exemplifies President Donald J. Trump and Duffy’s seriousness about returning Americans to the Moon and before China. &#8220;Amit has spent more than two decades as a dedicated public servant at NASA, working to advance American leadership in space. Under his leadership, the agency will chart a bold vision to return to the Moon during President Trump’s term,” said Duffy. “Amit&#8217;s knowledge, integrity, and unwavering commitment to pioneering a new era of exploration make him unique…",
