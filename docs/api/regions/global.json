We here at PC Gamer are divided on it ourselves, with some arguing that developers like Obsidian are right to downplay romance , while others praise Baldur's Gate 3 for its horniness . I'm in favor of more kissing and less killing in general, and its inclusion was one of many things I enjoyed about Adhoc Studio's superhero workplace comedy Dispatch. But while Dispatch doesn't shy away from nudity, it doesn't go as far as it could have. \"We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn’t have,\" Dispatch writer Pierre Shorette recently told Inverse . \"Maybe folks will get to see those one day.\" That wasn't the only thing they had to cut, with Shorette adding, \"There isn’t anyone on the development team that wouldn't have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game.\" Dispatch's animation is on a level above and beyond what we normally see in videogames, and honestly better than a lot of TV shows. That doesn't come cheap. \"We're still an indie studio,\" Shorette explained, \"I think people forget that because it's doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a …",

The graphics arms race is proving ever more costly for devs and players, with diminishing returns: The cutting edge Metal Gear Solid Delta left me feeling cold, especially compared to the similarly photorealistic, yet more vibrant, striking, and ten years older Phantom Pain. Meanwhile, people's champions like Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6 are scoring points with players by not just running on lower-end hardware, but looking and performing well . This isn't just a question of tech and optimization, according to Palalic.\"Good performance in a game isn't always a technical problem, it's as much of an art problem as well,\" he told me. \"A really strong art team can work within any shading and rendering limitations that are presented and lean into those.

I think a lot about trends in MMOs. Probably because I'm being paid to do just that, but also because I think the trends are just plain interesting; we've had a golden age where everyone was trying to make an MMO , tectonic shifts in the kind of things players want to do , and ever-changing social dynamics that keep this aged genre vivid and interesting. One design shift I will never understand, however, is the bizarre affliction that struck MMO designers in the latter half of that 2010s-2020s golden age: The sudden and irrational belief that tab-targeting MMOs (or hotbar MMOs, depending on your accent) are old news, and that every MMO had to have some sort of action combat system in it.

    "body": "\"When I first showed them the boost jump, are you kidding me? They almost threw me out of the room.\" Former Call of Duty director Glen Schofield is recalling the day he pitched Advanced Warfare's signature mechanic to Activision. As the series entered its second decade, it had already begun to veer away from historical drama and behind-the-headlines espionage. Treyarch was developing drone swarms for Black Ops 2, and Infinity Ward had dared to kick off the singleplayer campaign of Call of Duty: Ghosts in space. (Image credit: Activision) What Schofield was proposing, though, was something different: a futuristic moveset that would interfere with the fundamentals of CoD's sacred multiplayer component. Rather than merely providing novelty in the campaign, the boost jump would change the rules of competitive deathmatch, enabling players to reach high rooftops in newly vertiginous maps, and gain an edge through skilful combination of double jumps and mid-air dashes. If the idea backfired—drawing ire from a community which had grown used to its annualised fix of familiar FPS action—then Activision would be facing a serious threat to its most reliable cash cow.

In a first-floor flat above San Fierro's Chinatown, the amiable Triad leader Woozie is on the couch, clutching a gamepad. He's busy thrashing CJ Johnson in competitive multiplayer, much to the consternation of our protagonist. \"How are you in the water?\" Woozie asks, changing the subject. \"Can you swim well?\" \"No,\" replies CJ. \"I can't.\" The cutscene is a reflection of the background stat tracking that goes on in GTA: San Andreas—recording the player's weapon skill, driving ability, stamina, muscle, fat, and most pertinently, lung capacity.

The user reviews on Steam are bringing the game's score to a \"Mixed\" rating as players describe their issues logging in. As user Icedecknight put it in their review : \"Negative review until I can actually play the game.\" The official Tarkov account on X has acknowledged the launch woes, noting in a post that the team is \"aware that due to high traffic, some players may experience problems connecting to servers and authorising in the game and launcher.

But from CD Projekt's perspective, success seemed far from certain in the runup to launch. In particular, the Polish studio was deeply concerned about competition from another game released that summer, Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham Knight . The concern didn't derive purely from the fact that Arkham Knight was a hotly anticipated game. CD Projekt was more specifically worried that Rocksteady's open-world superhero game would shunt The Witcher 3 off the shelves at retailers. Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski explained the situation as it stood in early 2015: \"There was a big question about the execution of the marketing, are we going to be, you know, on par with, with the biggest out there?\" he said. \"We had huge, huge discussions, especially with the retail in the US, but also UK, you know, the main markets, Germany and so on, because it was about convincing them that we can actually be allowed to spend money in those channels.\" Nowakowski explains that retailers have different windows duri…",

    "body": "One of the earliest and most ambitious mods for Elden Ring , which revised and remixed its core systems to facilitate more tailored runs through The Lands Between, has just got a huge overhaul. Elden Ring: Reforged adds a vast array of new features like difficulty modes, runeforging, new combat mechanics like deflection and ducking, new weapons and bosses, and overhauled magic, weight and stamina systems to improve the viability of certain builds. It even introduces unique game modes. One thing the original version of the mod didn't offer, however, is multiplayer, due to how FromSoftware prohibits modded games from connecting to official servers. But the recently released 2.0 version of Elden Ring: Reforged addresses this, with the team creating a custom server to enable fully functional, FromSoft-style multiplayer. Update 2.0 introduces pretty much everything you'd expect from playing Elden Ring with other people. Summoning, invasions, and leaving messages for other players. According to Reforged's Nexus Mods page , it also offers \"advanced seamless coop support\", so playing with pals isn't limited to boss fights. Reforged makes one other key change to Elden Ring's multiplayer, l…",

Nonetheless, the trailer , the Steam page , and our own Shadow Labyrinth Review all point to this being a real thing that happened. Sadly, it seems Shadow Labyrinth landed with a bit of a thud (or perhaps that descending wailing noise Pac-Man makes when he dies). It only has a handful of Steam reviews , with many complaining about the experience being hindered by poor controls, sparse save points, and nasty difficulty spikes. But there is some good news. Bandai Namco has released an update aiming to address all these problems, while also adding a new mode that provides greater flexibility in play. Said new mode is called \"explorer mode\", which is a fancy way of saying \"easy mode\" as Bandai Namco explains in a recent Steam post: \"This mode significantly lowers the difficulty of combat and exploration, allowing you to better enjoy the story and world.\" This introduces some obvious adjustments, such as a more durable player character, increased dama…",

So while chatting with Dogubomb developer Tonda Ros this week, I naturally wanted to know what was coming next. With so many games being made into movies and TV shows, and since Blue Prince is so densely packed with stories and mysteries (some of which still haven't been fully uncovered yet ), I asked Ros if he'd been approached about a film adaptation. Might we see Blue Prince the movie someday? \"I have been approached, and I regret to tell the fans that it is not something I'm currently considering. To me, Blue Prince is this one game or this one piece of art in the medium of games. And so I couldn't really imagine it as anything else,\" Ros said. \"I'm a filmmaker myself.

The problem? Fish, apparently. I managed to play a little bit today without a ton of issues, but I wasn't the only one who experienced severe lag. Blizzard's been trying to figure out what's causing all the problems since the beta launched on Tuesday, and discovered yesterday that it might be some new fish technology that's bringing Azeroth to a crawl. \"We're still plugging away at this but we think we found a new problem,\" game producer Zorbrix wrote in a forum thread about the lag. \"FISH!\" They explained how there's new NPC behavior that's supposed to help creatures \"react to players and the environment in a more natural way\" instead of randomly wandering around and that it could be going haywire when too many players are nearby.

When Jung tries one more time to nail it down, saying, \"For you, you're the founder?\" Wales goes off. \"Can I just say again, it doesn't matter.

But somehow, Concord returned. Not official Concord, no, but a fan-fired effort to make the game playable again: As first reported by The Game Post , a small group has been working on the project for months, and full matches are now playable on customer servers. \"The project is still WIP,\" developer Red said on the Concord Delta Discord . \"It's playable, but buggy.\" The team shared a video of one of the test matches today on YouTube. It's not the most pro-tier shooter action I've ever seen, but yeah, that's definitely Concord. With the Concord revival now drawing a new level of attention, Red posted a follow-up asking everyone to be respectful, \"whether you like the game or not,\" an unfortunate acknowledgement of the ugliness that surrounded Concord's development and demise . They also made it clear that piracy will not be tolerated, and that the developers will not provide the Concord game files for anyone…",

The only bummer is you'll have to buy Tarkov again if you want all of the usual Valve integrations, but if you aren't worried about the friends list synchronization, achievements, or Steam profile activity tracking, then you can stick with the same old client. Whether you're planning to buy Tarkov again or you're a first time player preparing for launch, it's worth referencing Battlestate's FAQ for a rundown on linking your account and character progression.

I've played for 83 hours and watched a number of videos explaining mysteries I never solved myself—and I still don't feel like I know the whole story. Speaking with Blue Prince developer Tonda Ros of Dogubomb this week, I asked if players had discovered everything hidden in the mansion of Blue Prince, or if there were still mysteries in the game that no one had figured out. \"There are certainly mysteries still in the game, and there will probably always be some mysteries in the game,\" Ros said. \"And in order to preserve that mystery, I will probably never fully acknowledge whether or not everything has been solved. \"I know that for some games, they…",

My first night with Black Ops 7 went as well as expected. After scoping out the first few missions of the bizarre co-op campaign with friends, we hopped into 6v6 multiplayer, making a point to stick to the \"open\" playlists with \"minimal\" skill-based matchmaking. As I feared after the open beta, Black Ops 7 is shaping up to be another weak year for Call of Duty multiplayer, shining a light on the series' streak of diminishing returns. Much like Modern Warfare 3 (2023) to Modern Warfare 2 (2022), Blops 7 is very much an expensive expansion for Blops 6: Guns now have sci-fi greebling and Titanfall angles, but behave the same as last year. Its big movement \"innovation,\" the wall bounce, is barely there.

I've written extensively about my problems with the Portal's many baffling design choices, but until now Bungie has only tentatively admitted to the size of the problem. A series of patches and U-turns have tried to soften the abrasive edges of the Portal's design—aimed at reducing the absurd power grind as well as making buildcrafting feel less restrictive and punishing. Still, these felt like temporary stopgaps—desperate attempts to staunch the bleed that didn't address the root issues at the heart of the new design. In a blog post last night, Bungie finally laid it all out: \"With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards. \"Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was …",

From packed office spaces, roads clogged with vehicles, and public areas overflowing with people, finding silence to think and refresh isn't easy. Researchers in Japan believe they have cracked the problem, though, by developing a GPU-powered active noise cancellation system that's powerful enough to calm an entire room. That's according to NTT Laboratories , as reported by PC Watch . It claims to have developed the \"world's first spatial active noise control (spatial ANC) technology.\" Active noise cancellation (ANC) certainly isn't new, and many readers will probably own a gaming headset that sports the feature. What makes NTT's tech different is a combination of the speed of the sound processing and how it can be applied. Headphones with ANC use microphones to pick up nearby sounds, which are then sent to a small signal processor. This calculates the appropriate 'anti-phase' sounds to generate, which are then emitted via the speakers. The original noise and new sounds overlap and partly cancel each other out, greatly reducing the impact of the noise.…",

If you're just using a light shield, then repairs aren't an issue at all, as all you need are regular plastic parts. But if you have a medium shield it'll cost much more.

Nonetheless, new data from Mercury Research shows that, despite the frosty reaction towards these chips from the PC hardware community at large, it doesn't appear to have made as much of a dent in Intel's desktop market share as you might expect. MR reports that Intel's slice of the desktop CPU market is 4.9% lower in the third quarter of this year, compared to Q3 2025.

Starting with the joint venture between Adata and MSI , a new DDR5 module is set to appear on the market that is certainly going to be snapped up by anyone who needs as much RAM as possible in their PCs, without sacrificing performance. AMD and Intel's latest top-end desktop platforms (i.e. X870E and Z890) support up to 256 GB of RAM. However, to reach this amount, you normally have to buy four 64 GB DIMMs, filling every slot on the motherboard. When you do that, you're typically forced to use the memory's lowest speed (e.g. 4800 MT/s), which isn't ideal for something like high-resolution video editing. The answer to this is Adata and MSI's 4-rank DDR5 modules. Where most DIMMs have just one or two ranks of memory, these sticks will be so loaded with DRAM modules that each one will offer up to 128 GB of capacity. Not only that, they'll be rated to run…",

Since grabbing both items in this quest is primarily based on RNG, I'd suggest you bring a safe pocket with which to store either should you strike lucky. Despite having good loot, Stella Montis feels like a pretty friendly map at the moment, as players fight through so many Arc that they barely have time to kill each other.

Then charge $299 (AUD $499). It's a confident swing in a space dominated by Razer, SteelSeries, and Logitech, and for the most part, the Cloud Alpha 2 connects—if you actually need that base station. Battery life remains the headline. HyperX's previous Cloud Alpha Wireless —a long‑standing PC Gamer favorite for best wireless gaming headset until Razer took top honors— pulls a ludicrous 300 hours. The Cloud Alpha 2 Wireless, however, dials that back to a quoted 250. On paper it's a downgrade, but in real use it still feels like witchcraft.
