But while a metalhead from the Midwest or Northern Norway might load a bunch a friends into a beat-up van and road trip to the nearest big city, that wasn’t really an option for Lockman.

Many years later, Metallica played the Kingdom of Bahrain for the first time ever, rocking 10,000 adrenalized fans at the Beyon Al Dana Amphitheatre on Wednesday, Dec. 3, on their M72 World Tour. Lockman, naturally, was front and center at the sold-out venue — not simply because this was his teenage dream come true, but for professional reasons.

In March 1956, the weekly Billboard 200 albums chart premiered (at just 10 positions deep). Two years later, in August 1958, the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart began. At the end of 1958, Billboard printed a recap of the year&#8217;s biggest songs for the first time (that year also encompassing songs&#8217; performance on pre-Hot 100 charts leading up to its launch that August).

The RAM on the Homey Pro has been updated from 2GB to 4GB, now allowing it to run even more apps and workflows. The Homey Pro (2026) still costs the same, which isn’t very affordable, but it’s worth the investment, given its support lasts through 2031. Anyone who’s dabbled with smart home products from multiple brands will know what a mess it is. Different protocols, different apps, and each one requires signing up for a new account, just so you can turn a light on or off without getting out of bed. Thankfully, certain devices, including Homey, aim to address this fragmentation by serving as a single hub to control all your devices from a central location. When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house. And now that the device is getting a newer model that’s ready for 2026, we expect similar performance, given its key upgrade. Homey’s updated hub to rule all your smart home devices comes with 4GB of RAM, twice as much as the older model. Homey’s creator Athom says doub…",

These limited edition glasses borrow their hardware from VITURE’s recently launched Lumo Pro glasses. VITURE has also announced a new dock that extends compatibility to Nintendo Switch 2. Earlier this week, Google showed us a glimpse of what Android XR could look like without bulky glasses covering up a part of your face. These will be light-use glasses that complement, rather than replace, standalone headsets such as the Galaxy XR. In the meantime, tethered glasses that serve as extended displays for devices such as handheld gaming devices, laptops, or iPads are increasingly popular. VITURE is already flourishing in this segment, with more than 50% of the market share in the US. And today, it is bringing a (sort of) new product, marking its fondness for gamers. VITURE has announced a special edition of its Luma XR glasses to mark the fifth anniversary of Cyberpunk 2077’s release. These new edition glasses, created as part of an official collaboration with CD PROJEKT RED, appear to be based on the Luma Pro, which was only announced in July this year along…",

    "body": "TL;DR Google may be working on a native App Lock feature for Android 17 that lets users secure specific apps without the restrictions of Private Space. This new API allows the default launcher to lock apps, eliminating the need to use third-party app lockers. We spotted code for this feature in a recent Android Canary build, though it isn’t expected to officially launch until next year’s major update. People store a lot of sensitive data on their Android phones , so it’s no wonder they are reluctant to hand them over to anyone they don’t trust. Even if you are comfortable letting a friend or family member borrow your device, you probably still have data you don’t want them to see. Locking down specific apps is a great way to protect your privacy, but the core Android OS still lacks a native way to do this, forcing many users — especially of Pixel devices — to rely on third-party tools. Fortunately, Google may finally address this in next year’s Android 17 update by adding a new App Lock feature.

Evidence found in the Google app shows a pop-up warning about “discarding conversation” when changing settings. The feature mirrors a recent YouTube experiment but is currently incomplete, with no input box actually available yet. YouTube has recently begun testing the ability to allow users to customize their feed , giving them control over what they are recommended to watch next. The twist, though, is that this ability is facilitated through an AI chatbot that users must interact with by entering prompts. While it’s unclear whether YouTube will graduate this experiment into a permanent feature, it seems Google may be looking to bring this AI chatbot-powered custom feed to Discover as well.

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority The Pixel’s thermometer is one of those features that doesn’t come with a clear job description. It’s not like a camera or a fingerprint reader, where you instantly know why it’s part of your device. It sits on the back of the phone with no single, obvious purpose, which might explain why many Pixel owners forget it’s even there. But, as it turns out, lots of others are using it in all sorts of ways. A recent Reddit thread asking how the thermometer “contributes to your life” spiralled into an interesting catalogue of real-world uses, from checking toddler fevers to proving a hotel room’s AC was broken. That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home . She also asked you how you tend to use the thermometer in an article poll, and it turns out this supposedly gimmicky feature is surprisingly helpful. We’ve compiled a diverse range of uses here.",

This bug is the reason why the LibrePods app requires a rooted Android device. LibrePods brings features like ANC controls, ear detection, and more to AirPods on Android. An enterprising developer recently released an app called LibrePods , which enables a more feature-rich AirPods experience on Android. The app currently requires root access, and it turns out that a long-standing Android Bluetooth bug is the reason for this requirement. LibrePods developer Kavish Devar posted a bug report on Google’s Issue Tracker back on October 6, 2024 (h/t: Hacker News ), noting the specific code that’s standing in the way of root-free AirPods support. Over 9,100 votes have been cast on the issue, but the bug’s status has been marked as “assigned” by Google ever since then.",

Original article, December 9, 2025 (01:56 PM ET): What’s worse than Google removing a genuinely useful feature from Android?

McCall Galaxy clusters are the most massive objects in the universe held together by gravity, containing up to several thousand individual galaxies and huge reservoirs of superheated, X-ray-emitting gas. The mass of this hot gas is typically about five times higher than the total mass of all the galaxies in galaxy clusters. In addition to these visible components, 80% of the mass of galaxy clusters is supplied by dark matter. These cosmic giants are bellwethers not only for the galaxies, stars and black holes within them, but also for the evolution and growth of the universe itself. It is no surprise then that NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory has observed many galaxy clusters over the lifetime of the mission. Chandra’s X-ray vision allows it to see the enormous stockpiles of hot cluster gas, with temperatures as high as 100 million degrees, with exquisite clarity. This blazing gas tells stories about past and present activity within galaxy clusters. X-ray: NASA/CXC/Univ. of Chicago/H. McCall; Image processing: NASA/CXC/SAO/N.

The feature likely works by changing which internal key codes and axis values are transmitted to games. Last month, I shared evidence that Google is working on new gaming features for Android 17 . These include support for remapping buttons on gaming controllers and potentially a virtual gamepad. At the time, I wasn’t able to show off any of these features as the menus were incomplete.

If you see it, you are a lucky witness of a sprite, one of the least-understood electrical phenomena in Earth’s upper atmosphere.

They appear moments after a lightning strike – a sudden reddish flash that can take a range of shapes, often combining diffuse plumes and bright, spiny tendrils.

    "body": "TL;DR Chrome Canary includes a new chrome:// page specifically for AI Mode. The native integration allows AI Mode to access your open Chrome tabs. We don’t know when this feature will make it to stable Chrome. AI Mode is Google’s attempt to combine its longstanding flagship product Search with a more chatbot-like experience, answering questions using info from the web by parsing and reiterating information from web pages in an interaction that feels like a plain-language conversation. Now, the company’s working on integrating that experience more directly into the Chrome browser, testing a new version of AI Mode inside Chrome Canary. As spotted by Windows Report , the latest Chrome Canary desktop build features a version of Google’s AI Mode that opens in Chrome itself at chrome://contextual-tasks rather than directing the user to an external Google Search tab on the web. The interface is quite similar to the web implementation, showing the same Meet AI Mode heading and “Ask anything” text box.",

Unlike typical smart rings, the Index 01 doesn’t track activity or sleep. The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone. Recordings are processed and stored locally by default and there’s no subscription required to use the ring, though “an optional cloud service” allows for online backups and better-quality speech-to-text.",

It runs on Android 16 QPR2 , bringing with it a bunch of fresh features to Galaxy devices. The update might still be in beta, but I went ahead and installed it on my Galaxy S25 Ultra to see what all the fuss is about.

    "body": "TL;DR The Galaxy S26 Ultra has been certified by the FCC, confirming its chipset. The certification validates that both US and non-US models of the Galaxy S26 Ultra will feature a Snapdragon chipset. More specifically, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 runs the Ultra model across all regions. The Galaxy S26 is set to launch sometime in early 2026. The exact launch date remains unclear, with leakers divided on whether Samsung’s last-minute changes (or rather, the reversal of those changes) to the lineup could lead to a delay. Similarly, there have been speculations about the chip of choice, with leaks suggesting Samsung might equip the Galaxy S26 Ultra, along with the other two models, with an Exynos chip instead of a Snapdragon in some regions. While the launch date remains uncertain, a recent certification might put speculation about the chipset to rest. The Galaxy S26 Ultra recently visited the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), which certified it ahead of the launch. The certification document (via The Tech Outlook ) includes different variants carrying SM-S948B, SM-S948B/DS, SM-S948U, and SM-S948U1, where U refers to the US variant, while B refers to the international variant…",

But hear me out, because this might genuinely be the best quality-of-life hack I’ve added to my Galaxy setup in years. The Galaxy Fit 3 is an easier bedmate than a watch",

Advanced Measurement will let users set specific volume level targets for warning notifications. Lots of us use our smartphones and wearables to track our health , but what exactly does that encompass? The very concept of “health” is a lot more multi-faceted and nuanced than just “not sick” or “feeling good,” and we’ve developed dozens of metrics we can track in pursuit of all its forms, from calories burned during a workout, to time spent snoring at night. And while the problem with snoring is more about what it means for the person doing it than the person who might have to listen to it, today we’re very much thinking about loud sounds like that as we check out what Samsung Health is working on next.

Prices range from $1,699 to $2,399. If you’ve ever wondered what a Kindle-like display would look like scaled up to the size of your torso, PocketBook now has an answer. The company’s new InkPoster lineup brings full-color e-paper to framed, wall-mounted displays, delivering a matte, print-like aesthetic you can personalize. The 31.5-inch model starts at $1,699, while the upgraded 28.5-inch IGZO version comes in at $2,399, positioning these firmly in the premium decor category. The beauty of the idea is that modern color E Ink panels achieve a paper-like look without glare or backlighting. Meanwhile, E Ink only draws meaningful power when an image changes, so the posters can theoretically hold artwork for months on a charge. Through a companion app, users can browse curated galleries or upload personal photos, turning a static wall into a rotating art exhibit, but with the visual calm of printed media.",

The December Pixel Drop, which arrived exactly a week ago , was primarily aimed at eradicating a punch list of issues troubling users of the Pixel 6 and above. But in fixing those bugs, Google may have triggered a handful of new ones. After we learned about a relatively less bothersome snag with single-handed mode or an unsightly glitch with the always-on display , we’re learning of a major issue that could potentially impact a broader set of Pixel 10 users. Reddit user tstrmr recently posted about the display on their Pixel 10 Pro XL becoming unresponsive randomly. The issue specifically occurs when the phone is locked and sat down for a certain duration, following which the display stops registering touch at all.",

In our recent poll, nearly 72% of readers said they liked the feature , which is a comfortable win for something brand new in a season already packed with roundups. Recap pulls together your year on YouTube across 12 cards, including the summarizing Personality Card. Now, YouTube has shared how common each personality actually is. According to the company’s blog , these personalities are meant to be a simple way of grouping different viewing patterns. They’re not meant to be deep insights into who you are, just a light shorthand for the sort of content you spend most of your time with.

The film also pulls in global moments like major cricket matches and a reference to the first American pope. Google already shared the top trending searches of 2025 last week , but now it has released the video version. The fast and chaotic montage pulls together many of the moments people kept asking about this year to summarize the last 12 months and add a touch of nostalgia. You can watch it above. The film has its own angle, built around a “reimagining” concept that pops up a few times, mixed with some big soundtrack choices. It starts with Ozzy Osbourne’s Crazy Train, swings into Lady Gaga’s Abracadabra, and eventually settles into Golden, performed by various artists. It ends up feeling a bit like Spotify Wrapped or YouTube Recap , just with more real-world news footage and less personalization.",

A more advanced follow-up to the surprisingly popular Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses (), the new glasses have a monocular display (meaning there’s one screen in one of the lenses), a Neural Band wrist strap that lets you control what you see by performing air gestures, and, most importantly, a price: $799. While expensive, this kept Meta at the forefront of the burgeoning XR revolution by making it the first major tech player to have a retail-ready set of smart glasses that seem to bring us the future Google Glass promised us over 10 years ago. Unfortunately for Meta, there are three major problems with the new Ray-Bans.
