Game director Mark Roberts tells PC Gamer that there's a few reasons for that, but mostly it's a fear that not making something fresh—as Grinding Gear Games has always done—might disappoint its loyal players. But this time it \"just kind of felt right,\" Roberts says. In the Keepers of the Flame expansion, which arrives on October 31, PoE will return to Breach, a nine-year-old mechanic that is basically about killing monsters in a circle until time runs out. The simplicity of Breach will stay. Roberts stresses that the team wanted to be extremely careful about adding unnecessary complexity that might alienate its long-time fans. It will still involve touching a creepy hand and killing monsters inside of an expanding circle, but those monsters will have improved behavior thanks to tech that was worked on for the last Path of Exile 2 patch . And now there will be \"unstable\" breaches which call in a new boss to cap off the event. Endgame areas will spawn Breach Hives, which are fleshy cities you can raid and destroy for access to a new type of reward for PoE: The Genesis Tree. Eve…",

Duckov's got a surprising amount of depth under that parody appearance. Duckov developer Team Soda, a studio owned by China's Bilibili media platform, isn't resting easy on its laurels: Less than 24 hours after announcing its 1 million sales milestone, Team Soda has pushed a new update with a smattering of new features, balance adjustments, and bugfixes. Most of the changes are fairly mundane. Orange headphones can now be dismantled for materials; there's a new UI indicator for when the player's injured; dogs are now more of an early game terror thanks to their footsteps being silenced.

    "body": "Microsoft's last two years have been marked by the layoffs of more than 10,000 workers , repeated development studio closures , and countless game cancellations —a relentless series of bloodletting and downsizing, made only more dire by the preceding consolidation campaign that saw swaths of the games industry brought under the corporation's gaming division. Thanks to new reporting from Bloomberg , we now have a clearer idea of the motivation for Microsoft's current gaming strategy—if it can be called that. According to sources familiar with the business, Microsoft executives have been pressuring the Xbox division to achieve profit margins well in excess of industry average. Bloomberg reports that in fall of 2023, Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood introduced a new target of 30% \"accountability margins\"—Microsoft's corporate euphemism of choice for profit margins—for the gaming division. In comparison, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that profit margins in the games industry have fallen from a recent height of 22% during the COVID lockdown years of 2020 and 2021 to an average of 17% in 2024. In other words, Microsoft executives have been expecting the Xbox divisio…",

But if you're not a fan of this pad's Xbox-style asymmetric sticks and button glyphs, Razer has another 'don't worry, I've got you' offering. Enter the Raiju V3 Pro , another wireless controller pitched towards the Esports scene but instead featuring symmetrical TMR sticks and PlayStation stylings. All for $220, which is $20 more than the latest iteration of the Wolverine. Sorry, what ? The TMR sticks contribute in part to that steep premium. For those unaware, the Hall effect is one magnetic tech that effectively banishes stick drift, and TMR (or tunnelling magnetoresistance) is another. The difference is that the way TMR leverages its electromagnetic sensors allows the controller's sticks to pick up really minute movements, making for a level of precision above even what the Hall effect can offer. Oh, and on the Raiju V3 Pro, you can swap in a long, long thumbstick topper for even more precise movement if that's your jam (though I'm not sure it's mine).

Per analyst firm Circana (via Gamesindustry.biz ), Borderlands 4 has Gearbox counting stacks for the foreseeable future: It was the number one US best-seller for the month of September (August 31 to October 3, to be specific). Not just that, but it's sold 30% more than Borderlands 3's debut, and stands as the fastest-selling game in the franchise's history. Exactly how many stacks is a different ballgame. Borderlands 4, according to Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, had more than twice the budget of Borderlands 3 (assuming he wasn't just being hyperbolic, which is always possible ). Whether or not these nippy sales are enough to categorise it as an unmitigated success for Pitchford are entirely dependent on what his studio's goals are.

Project TAL is coming from developer Madngine, and while we do have a few years to wait until it's released, we did just get a little peek at what it's going to look like via a new announcement trailer , and my interest has been piqued. The trailer is pretty fast-paced, but you can get a good look at what kind of ancient enemies await you in Project TAL. There are action sequences peppered between glimpses of vast, beautiful forests and villages there; these show the main character taking on beasts of yore alongside NPC companions who will quite literally catch you when you fall. (Image credit: WEMADE MAX) \"Each NPC companion character has unique abilities, personalities, and combat roles, ranging from defence and support to melee, ranged, and magic,\" a press release explains. \"Players will encounter moments of seamless cooperation in Project TAL, such as catching a falling companion mid-battle, or watching a support companion deploy a magical barrier to deflect enemy attacks.\" There are also features like \"climbing action\", which sees players…",

And now Razer has launched the Raiju V3 Pro, available for purchase immediately, which looks to be a PlayStation-shaped answer to the Wolverine V3 Pro. It's a little strange calling it the V3 Pro, because as far as I can tell there was no Raiju V2 or V2 Pro, just the original Raiju, plus an Ultimate and Tournament edition . Still, I suppose it makes sense to name it V3 Pro to keep it in-line with the Wolverine V3 Pro, given it looks like it's essentially the same controller but in symmetrical PlayStation layout. It works with and is at least in part designed for use with the PS5, of course, but also for PC. In fact, on PC it reaches up to 2,000 Hz polling, which is twice what you get with the Wolverine V3 Pro, but obviously less than what you get on the 8,000 Hz Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC.

Instead it's a tweak of Xe2, as seen in the Intel Arc B580 desktop GPU and the Lunar Lake laptop chip. We kinda knew that, but now it's absolutely official. But even Intel itself doesn't yet understand how it all relates to the new collab' with Nvidia on PC graphics. Yes, really. In a new podcast with PCWorld , Intel's long suffering graphics rep Tom Petersen has had another stab at clarifying the confusion that's resulted from Intel's recent Panther Lake tech day and that slide . You know, the one that revealed the iGPU in Panther Lake was indeed Xe3-based, but didn't even mention the Celestial architecture that had hitherto to been synonymous with Xe3 and also indicated that the Xe3 iGPU in Panther Lake would be branded \"B\" series, which up until now had been aligned with the Xe2 architecture. In short, it was all utterly baffling. Over to Petersen in response to the question of whether Xe3 in Panther Lake is Cel…",

The first half of the game crescendos with a pair of classic Obsidian conversation boss fights, and I had a big, dumb smile on my face as I contemplated long, scrolling lists of dialogue options⁠—some available to me, some greyed-out—gated by different skills, background traits, quest choices, and even an out-of-the-way optional conversation I'd had over 10 hours previously. Since I had a ton of points in speech and had gone for nonviolent resolutions whenever possible, I was able to pull off a satisfying \" everybody lives! \" conclusion to this midgame climax.

Whenever trout guy stops eating, everyone barks at him to eat more trout. Whenever he moves tiles, a manhunt starts until he is discovered again amongst the swarm. He cannot escape.

Deus Ex: Human Revolution was set in 2027; we simply cannot almost be there in real life. Ahem. The good news is that that 'release window' is set to become a 'release date' imminently. Mouse's date is set to hit literally today, as part of the ongoing Galaxies Gaming Showcase. It'll just be a date in 2026 rather than 2025, now. If you've not been keeping track, Mouse is a good ol'-fashioned FPS in a good ol'-fashioned style. Literally. The game's done up like Steamboat Willy—a black-and-white, cartoon-ified world filled with '20s gangster-rodents for you to tommy-gun your way through.

One blocker to that might be hesitation over the new bespoke version of Windows running on the handheld. However, it turns out the handheld can run Bazzite—a Linux OS extremely similar to SteamOS—and doing so actually improves performance. That's going by tech YouTuber Cyber Dopamine's ad-hoc testing (via Tom's Hardware ). They got Bazzite up and running and spoke to one of the operating system's devs who ironed out any bugs and got the OS running well on the ROG Xbox Ally X. The end result is an ROG Xbox Ally X that seems to offer a better handheld gaming experience, though only in the games that actually work on Linux, of course. Bazzite isn't SteamOS, but it runs Steam's Big Picture Mode on top of a custom Fedora Linux distribution, and looks and runs essentially the same as SteamOS, with some extra options and so on. That in itself is a point in its favour, by my books, because SteamOS is very simple to use—it's one of the reasons I rate the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS so highly.

But one of the enduring complaints about Siege X is that the shift to free-to-play has triggered a huge uptick in cheating. I caught up with Siege creative director Alexander Karpazis at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week. I asked if the team at Ubisoft Montreal expected cheating to surge to the extent that it did in June. \"We knew having free access that it could be a vector that is exploited,\" he said, \"and we were ramping up our R6 ShieldGuard. In a lot of ways it really did help, but we need to be faster when it comes to making sure that we stay one step ahead of cheat makers, too.\" Eliminating cheating entirely is impossible, I acknowledged, and Karpazis agreed. \"Absolutely.

He listed Tekken 1-5 as his \"most hated\" games and had public \"feuds\" with Tekken's Katsuhiro Harada and Devil May Cry's Hideki Kamiya. While working on 2005's Ninja Gaiden Black, he said that Devil May Cry 3 director Hideaki Itsuno—who went on to make DMC 4, 5, and Dragon's Dogma—\"did pretty well for a young guy\" and \"might make something even better next time.\" Behind the blustery facade, Itagaki seemingly respected his action game peers a great deal; roasting them was his way of projecting the image of a true Master Ninja. But as I tried to convey in my Ninja Gaiden 4 review , Itagaki's games were different from the ones his competitors were making. It wasn't just that they tended to be more challenging, but that they took themselves so seriously; the winking tone that Kamiya favored with DMC's Dante and later Bayonetta were nowhere to be found in Itagaki's games. His sense of humor was adding an easier \"Ninja Dog\" mode to Ninja Gaiden for players who died too many times on the first level. The most cosmically strange thing about Ninja Gaiden 4…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Steam reviews are an endless source of both information and amusement. Where else can you read a review from someone who has played a survival game for 35,000 hours before giving it a thumbs-down ? Or, for that matter, find a glowing review of an MMO someone has played for less than an hour? But the best Steam reviews, for my money, are the ones where a player hammers out a review that encapsulates an entire game in just a few words, like the one in the image above by Steam user \"Cyber Lesbian\" for Marvel Rivals. Short reviews are like mini-poems, really, and even when they're silly they can still tell you a lot about game. I put a quiz together a few weeks ago to challenge you to identify 10 games based only on a blurb from a Steam review . It went over well, so we're doing it again! In the quiz below, see if you can guess the game based on a short Steam review . And let us know how you scored in the comments: overwhelmingly positive, or mostly negative?",

Cards Against Humanity purchased the plot of land, located near the border between the US and Mexico, in 2017 to protest (and, one would assume, hinder) the erection of a wall between the two countries. In 2023, a local homeowner noticed that SpaceX was using the site for building materials and heavy equipment and brought it to CAH's attention, after which SpaceX gave CAH a \"12-hour ultimatum to accept a lowball offer\" for the land. Instead, CAH sued. The settlement came shortly before the case went to trial, which was scheduled to happen on November 3. CAH told AP that SpaceX copped to trespassing during the discovery phase, but it opted to settle because a trial \"would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX.\" Beyond that, CAH said \"the upside is that SpaceX has removed their construction equipment from our land and we’re able to work with a local landscaping company to restore the …",

But despite how Escape From Duckov presents itself, it actually doesn't waste much time on duck material. Yes, almost every NPC is some type of waterfowl, and yes, enemies quack when they notice you. But aside from an occasional duck egg consumable, there's not much duck humor going on at all. In fact, you don't even really have to play as one: The duck customization options give you all the tools to craft a different bird entirely. Or a sort of Fall Guys-esque bean man. Or Heihachi from Tekken.

But I have seen the light at the end of the tunnel: the coming arrival of two sparkling new fields of battle that Battlefield 6 sorely needs. I've played Blackwell Fields and Eastwood, the two maps of Battlefield 6 Season 1, and they make an amazing impression. They're gorgeous, distinct, spacious, and most importantly, they're packing loads of vehicles. They are exactly the injection of large-scale action that Battlefield 6 currently underdelivers—in fact, they balance out the map pool so well that it's disappointing they weren't included at launch.

In all seriousness, Hello Games long ago completed the redemption arc for No Man's Sky, (which now sits at \"Very Positive\" on Steam with around 170,000 reviews) and for years now has been on a well-deserved victory lap. We can have a laugh about Murray's inability to leave the 'we're just the little guys' schtick behind, but at the same time there's no doubting that love has been poured into this game over just shy of a decade. No Man's Sky received the major Voyager update just over a month ago , adding the ability to build and customise giant spaceships known as Corvettes that you can get your mates to act as crew on. A really nice touch is that you can set your destination and then, just like Star Trek, go for a little walk around the ship's interior, have a chat, and fiddle around with the ship's layout…",

That's what managing a medieval city is all about. Farms are important for long-term survival, but fishing and gathering makes more sense if people need food quickly. Chopping logs into planks means construction on new buildings can commence, but if people are freezing in their homes, that timber should be turned into firewood instead. And assigning laborers to salvage nearby ruins for resources should be put on hold if—and here's just one quick example—a giant angry bear is rampaging through the town brutally mauling everybody to death. Yeah, a murder-bear can shuffle a city's priorities real fast. Forget fishing and firewood: every single citizen's job right now is to find something sharp and become an expert bear-stabber.

But if, like me, the Evo is your first foray into Secretlab's world of desks, it's a worthy investment—if you can stomach its hefty price tag. When the Secretlab Magnus Evo first arrived, the biggest thing that stuck out to me was just how heavy the thing was. I opted for the 1.5 m desk length for my small apartment—though it also comes in the slightly larger 1.7 m length option—and with a metal frame containing motor work in the legs, my delivery tracking informed me that the box came in at a whopping 63 kg. Thankfully I had the foresight to call a friend for help with assembly, and I would definitely recommend two people to put the Magnus Evo together. The parts are heavy, and the desk has to be assembled upside down before lifted upright. The actual process of putting the desk together was simple—I'd consider myself to be a little illiterate…",
