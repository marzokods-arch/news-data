That led to an immediate question: Which school did it represent ? There are several in the world of The Witcher, after all: Geralt's School of the Wolf is the one we know best, but there are also schools dedicated to the Viper, the Bear, the Manticore, and others, each with different attitudes and approaches to their profession. That's true of the games, anyway, but apparently it's not the case in the books they're based on. In a new AMA on Reddit , Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski said the whole idea of individual Witcher schools is based on a mistake, and it hasn't gone away because \"videogame people\" won't let it go. \"A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish,\" Sapkowski explained. \"I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot.

And now it's gearing up to leave early access, with the 1.0 launch set for October 16 . Unfortunately, the players never really took to it, outside of the diehards. Active players quickly tapered off following the early access launch, with only small spikes thanks to notable updates. But even that seems to have stopped.

The Arctis Nova Elite launches today, September 30, for $600/£600/€650. Okay, if you're still with me, let's talk specs. The headset looks a lot like the $325 Arctis Nova Pro —from the swooped back earcups and placement of the ANC and boom arms, to the desktop hub included with both sets. SteelSeries says it teamed up with a designer here, Jakob Wagner, but the external differences appear to be mostly material. Literally—the Elite has a little more metal, including the control wheel on the side, which might explain the added weight. The Elite weighs 380 grams. The Pro, 338 grams. But under the hood, there are some changes. The Elite's drivers are touted as carbon fibre. Rated to the same frequency response as the Pro's 40 mm drivers, 10 - 40,000 Hz, the carbon fibre cans are more sensitive with a dBSPL of 101 to the Pro's 98.

So, why did The Serial port then strap 12 dial up modems together, specifically ? To utilise Multilink PPP and attempt to stream YouTube over multiple 56 Kbps internet connections. After a little bit of maths, the creators worked out that they'd need at least a 182,286 bits per second connection to watch one of their own recent uploads at 240p resolution (YouTube's lowest video quality on desktop) without buffering.

I've played a little Dark Ties , and it's good fun going absolutely ham on the unsuspecting punks of Kamurocho as Mine, but there was almost a world where we would never have gotten to play him at all. RGG's original plan was for the Dark Ties' story to be, uh, basically a video they bundled onto the Kiwami 3 disc. It was \"something that could be viewed like a video,\" Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties director Ryosuke Horii recently told Famitsu (translated by Automaton ). So, you know, DarkTies.mp4 in other words. Thankfully, the devs at RGG realised it'd be much cooler if you actually got to step into Mine's immaculate Florsheims. Making Mine playable was, says Horii, \"the best way to tell his story,\" which is a very game developer response to the question, 'Why did you make this a videogame?'

This feeling has returned full-force after seeing a developer kindly explaining the difference between Skill Damage and Action Skill damage on the game's subreddit (thanks, TheGamer ), which probably isn't the place you should have to go for this sort of clarification. Turns out, it's a rectangles/squares situation. Except this is Borderlands, so lead character designer Nicholas Thurston uses guns and shotguns as the metaphor: \"Skill Damage and Action Skill Damage is like Gun Damage and Shotgun Damage. All Skills are skills, but only some are Action Skills. Same as all Guns are Guns, but only some are Shotguns.\" Simple, then. Thurston then explains that Skill Damage impacts basically everything involving the word \"Skill\", including passive skills and traits and, you guessed it, Action Skills.

Tom's Hardware was invited out to test out both the Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme chips recently, reporting test scores that look fittingly great.

In mod project timelines, this is basically a nanosecond turnaround. If you're not familiar, OpenMW is an open-source engine reimplementation for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind that lets you run it on modern Windows, Linux, and macOS with a minimum of fuss and at modern resolutions. It's undoubtedly my go-to way to play these days, especially now this 0.50 release candidate has made the game way easier to play on a gamepad. Don't tell anyone, but my first exposure to Morrowind was its original Xbox version, with its uncharismatic sans-serif fonts and its tendency to slyly reboot your entire console to cope with its strict RAM limits. I still have nostalgia for its gamepad iteration and, hell, I just like being able to kick back on my sofa or play things easily on my Steam Deck. \"Despite the nice round number, 0.50.0 is a focused release,\" writes OpenMW's capo (that's their name, not their rank), \"its core highlight is…",

Rolling out to the Dev and Beta channel , preview build 26220.6760 will offer an internet speed check right from the Windows system tray in the taskbar. This feature is currently only accessible to Windows Insiders on Windows 11, version 24H2, and it won't mean my enduring friendship with Ookla's Speedtest.net will have to come to an end either. According to Windows Latest , Microsoft entered into a partnership with Ookla back in 2023 to provide Bing's speed test widget, and the new taskbar feature is just a more local redirect to this Bing widget. Windows Insiders can either launch the speed test from the Wi-Fi quick settings menu or by simply right-clicking the network icon in the system tray on the right-most side of the taskbar.

Despite executive producer Tom Cannon saying in July that \"our goal is to keep the game up, online, and available\" from the closed beta's launch, it seems that Riot needs just a few days to get everything straightened out. A post on the 2XKO X account reads: \"We need a little more time to get early access up and running, so we'll be shutting down closed beta a few days early on Oct 3 @ 9pm PT.\" Servers will be back up and running in time for the early access launch on October 7 at 8am PT/11am ET/4pm BST. Riot says that offline mode will still work, so players should still be able to hit the lab, play local multiplayer, and face off against CPUs. Three-and-a-half days to do some tinkering behind the scenes is nothing in the grand scheme of things, especially when I think about other fighting games who took their betas offline and straight-up vanished for a year— looking at you, Multiversus.

The woman, Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, also allegedly known as \"the goddess of wealth\" by some, plead guilty to two counts in Southwark Crown Court, related to the acquisition and possession of criminal property (via BBC News ). The assets in question: 61,000 bitcoin. 61,000 x 113,000 = 6.893 billion dollars. The value has shifted a little since the Met made its calculations, but that's bitcoin for you. Six months ago a single bitcoin was worth less than $100,000. Six years ago it was around $3,000. Qian is said to have received the bitcoin from large-scale fraud in China, with over 128,000 victims pouring their cash into Qian's investments. Qian then stored the stolen assets in bitcoin, which has had a pretty good year.

The fun is now over. Blizzard has temporarily disabled the key to the infinite damage build until further notice. You can watch BigPapaPlump spend 23 minutes explaining the particulars on how the build worked, but the gist is that it involved spamming a skill that infects enemies with poison over and over until the numbers weren't numbers anymore. Damage over time skills in Diablo 4 have always gotten funky when you have a way to \"pop\" them for one massive hit.

It's the biggest leveraged buyout in history, meaning that the new EA is instantly saddled with $20 billion of debt, and will face intense pressure to crank those profits. And it's also the latest step in the Saudi Arabian Investment Fund's mission to \"sportswash\" the brutal regime, by using its influence and ubiquity across entertainment industries to distract from some of the world's most appalling human rights abuses. As the crack team at PCG towers discussed the deal, one line stuck with me: \"I wouldn't want to be sitting in a BioWare chair right now.\" The vibes around one of the all-time great RPG studios have not been good in recent years, and the fairly decent Dragon Age: The Veilguard didn't persuade anyone that the studio is capable of surpassing contemporary greats like Baldur's Gate 3 or Disco Elysium. Early this year, the studio was apparently cut to the bone in a round of layoffs , though a new Mass Effect game remains in development. For now.

Publisher Reef Entertainment announced today that the planned October 31 release date has been bumped to November 26 , for a pretty simple reason: Global financial instability. \"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector's Editions,\" the publisher wrote. \"Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.\" The Terminator 2D: No Fate Collector's Edition is a pretty swanky package, with a Steelbook case and collector's tin, art book, flipbook, a \"premium metal paperweight,\" two cloth posters, a fake arcade token, and more.

Things didn't go so well for longtime GTA producer Leslie Benzies, whose studio Build A Rocket Boy released MindsEye earlier this year. That was a bit of a disaster, to the extent the developer immediately went through a round of layoffs . Another departure was Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar who left in 2020 to establish Absurd Ventures, which is so far living up to the name by releasing a graphic novel, an audio drama, a novel, and recently announcing the Absurdaverse . Before leaving Rockstar, Houser was a lead writer on every GTA game since GTA London 1969 (released in 1999), and with GTA5 first releasing in 2013 it's not unreasonable to think he may have had some involvement there. Not so. In a new interview with IGN Houser says he had no involvement with GTA 6: \"They're always a new story. It's not going to be a story I wrote or a character set that I developed, but I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure.\" Houser's asked if it'll be a bit weird playing a new GTA…",

Valve said back in February that the Autumn Sale would fire up a couple months early for 2025: It didn't say why, but the obvious guess is to put more room between it and the Steam Winter Sale: In previous years, the big year-ending blowout would kick off just a couple weeks after the end of the Autumn Sale, and that's just not enough time between two of the biggest videogame sales of the year.

This week I've been: continuing to play way too much Borderlands 4 and waiting for Battlefield 6. One thing that surprised me from the Battlefield 6 beta back in August was that Battlefield Studios seemed to be aiming for a more casual, fast-paced experience. Smaller maps are one thing, but the remarkably frictionless weapon handling seriously ramped up the speed of shootouts and all but removed the need to tap or burst fire at longer ranges. Simply by slapping a single-port brake or the basic folding vertical grip on any weapon would immediately resolve any recoil issues. In this way, the Battlefield 6 beta felt an awful lot like a battle royale—Call of Duty Warzone being the elephant in the room—in which weapons are highly efficient at way further ranges than they really should be. It was a shame, considering Battlefield has long prided itself on being more realistic/grounded/authentic (you name it) than Call of Duty. It's also ironic, given that Battlefield 6 will actually have a battle royale component, and I've no doubt this more streamlined weapon handling was designed with…",
