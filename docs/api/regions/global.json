Capcom eventually agreed to let GOG re-release Dino Crisis and the first three Resident Evils, though it took \"time, persistence, and trust-building,\" Gnyp says.

There's a psycho to your northeast, but they could be standing right in front of you or ten blocks away. See what I mean? Luckily, tucked away at the bottom of the 'gameplay' tab in the settings menu is the radar display .

You may recall that previous Borderlands games on Steam were review-bombed earlier this year because of changes in their EULAs. There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players. It was all a bit (or a lot) overblown, as PC Gamer's Tyler Colp pointed out: \"a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything.\" Those review bombings did indeed have little impact…",

Chatbots, the FTC said, are designed to mimic human behaviors and \"communicate like a friend or confidant, which may prompt some users, especially children and teens, to trust and form relationships with chatbots.\" Because of that, and—one would assume—the recent uptick in awful outcomes from their use, the agency wants to know what the companies that make chatbots are doing to protect their users. \"Protecting kids online is a top priority for the Trump-Vance FTC, and s…",

Meanwhile, the just-released Hollow Knight: Silksong didn't raise any performance concerns, but gamers in China were dismayed to discover that the Chinese translation was botched. Those are just a couple of the reasons some gamers have chosen to reject launch day hype in favor of \"patient gaming\": Waiting a year or more to play new games, which means getting them cheaper during a sale and playing them after a bunch of big performance and quality-of-life patches have likely made them much better than they were at launch. There's even a pretty active subreddit dedicated to the idea : the main rule is that you're not allowed to post about games that are under a year old. But there's also a reason HBO's servers sometimes struggled with Sunday night demand at the height of Game of Thrones' popularity. There's something special about being there on day one (before they edit out the Starbucks cups ) and reacting and emoting with the crowd. As I write, nearly 200,000 people are playing Borderlands 4 on Steam just hours after it released—on what is for me a Thursday morning. Clearly,…",

Multiple Steam users report low frame rates and persistent stuttering, even at reduced graphical settings and on powerful hardware, and complaints about frequent crashes are also common. \"Terrible, terrible performance.

LockerGoga was used in an attack on Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian energy company, that affected all of its 170 sites and caused an estimated $81 million in damages.

Now, I'm pleased to report that its tenure on my waitlist will be a short one, because Easy Delivery Co. is launching a week from today on September 18. (Image credit: Oro Interactive) \"What started out as a little project on Itch has now become quite the adventure,\" developer Sam C said in a Steam news post announcing the release date. \"The game features three different areas for you to explore and deliver items in, with various truck upgrades allowing you to reach new places. Meet the residents of these towns, talk to them (or try to), and learn more about the snowy regions you found yourself in.\" Compared to the demo, it sounds like the full releas…",

Unfortunately, you're restrained by how many skill points you can earn, which is based on the current max level , so you can't splash the cash and unlock every power. Below, I'll go over the max level in Borderlands 4 and how many skill points you can expect to earn right now, so you can properly plan out your characters ' builds. However, I'll also discuss whether we can expect this to increase in the future. What is the max level in Borderlands 4? The max level in Borderlands 4 is 50 , giving you a total of 49 skill points to spend across your three skill trees. Every five skill points you spend unlocks the next layer of the skill tree, apart from the final tier, which requires an extra point to get the final perk. In other words, you could almost reach the end of two skill trees if you're being efficient, though that's not really optimal for most builds. There are a few key features related to your progression: You'll start encountering loot drops with Firmware as early as level 25 (these are effectively gear sets).

But whaddaya know, it turns out it's actually reasonably achievable, as demonstrated by our host, Vik-on (via Videocardz ). While plenty of modders have strapped more memory modules to graphics cards in the past, it's usually been a technical exercise, rather than creating a genuinely useable GPU at the end of it. Vik-on, however, looks to have been able to double the VRAM capacity of their RTX 4090 successfully with relative ease. Key to this achievement is a leaked Nvidia BIOS, which gives our modder the ability to force support for different capacities and amounts of memory modules using Ada-generation chips. Making the graphics chip itself play nicely with more memory, though, is only half the battle. The new modules also need to physically connect wi…",

This is a classy case, and, whether it's aimed at pro creators or pro gamers, one that many should consider for their next build—but not without some caveats. The initial draw of the PA401? Real wood. You know you've made it when your PC case was once alive. Each of the slats over the front intake on the PA401 is made from (sustainably sourced) ash with a glossy finish. So glossy, in fact, the grain is far less noticeable compared to the Fractal Design Terra or North. It's almost indistinguishable from plastic unless you're right up to it. Personally, I like it. The understated wood effect fits with the diminutive design across the rest of the case. But other members of the PC Gamer team thought it needed a little more pizazz. Altogether a simple case to build into, the ProArt stands out for the smaller details.

Seems weird to me, but I guess that's just the crazy, mixed-up world we live in. What's more, some of those videogames websites have been playing Borderlands 4 and now they have thoughts about it. As for our thoughts, well, you'll have to wait a little longer for those . But to hear the other guys tell it, Gearbox seems to have (mostly) learnt the right lessons from the doldrums of Borderlands 3, turning out a looter-shooter with a great deal of satisfying looting and shooting, and relatively little tedious, meme-heavy humour. Here's what the rest of the world is saying about Borderlands 4. \"Every millisecond of a good scrap bursts with texture\" GamesRadar+ : 4/5 Our comrades at GR seem to have had a very good time reducing the denizens of Kairos to indeterminate goo. Reviewer Andrew Brown says the game spends its time \"careening you from one shootout to the next,\" with particular praise for its enemy variety and the sheer ludicrous malleability of the game's 80 bajillion guns: \"so overkill they throw out the rules not only on how shooters s…",

As a gamer, I'm used to seeing flashy chairs from the usual suspects, but this was something different enough to grab my attention. And honestly, as someone who's getting on in years and feeling the toll of endless hours at a desk, I'm always on the hunt for anything that might make those marathon computer sessions a little less punishing on my back. Enter the LiberNovo Omni : apparently the world's first dynamic ergonomic chair that promises real-time spine support, motorized lumbar adjustment, four distinct recline positions, and even a built-in spinal stretch massage. The idea of a chair that could actually adapt to how I sit—rather than forcing me into its own mold—was enough to make me take a closer look. But is it the revelation we've been waiting for, or just a flashy Kickstarter moonshot with a few too many moving parts? Unboxing the Omni, I immediately notice its sci-fi vibe.

In a recent video (via Techeblog ), it's shown forehanding, backhanding, and smashing ping pong balls with impressive dexterity and, dare I say it, human- like movement. What's so visually impressive about it, at least to my eyes, is how it keeps balance and makes quick decisions and very human-like arm and leg movements. In particular, as someone who used to play a lot of table tennis and who wasn't awful at it, I was genuinely impressed by how HITTER returns smashes, and also with the return at 0:28 right off the edge of the table.

Taking two hits of damage rather than the one we were used to in Hollow Knight (since it was so rare for an enemy to inflict two) has certainly been a learning curve for a lot of people. But that hasn't stopped the usual suspects declaring that the game isn't difficult and those struggling simply need to \"get good\". If you fall among this crowd, I applaud you and just know every time I run back to the Savage Beastfly arena I'm struck with a pang of jealousy. But if you're (somehow) finding the game too easy, fret not. There's now a mod that allows you to increase the double damage caused by some enemies to triple. The 'No Double Damage' mod created by TheLima does exactly what it says on the tin, but not in the way you'd think.

To be quite frank, if this was a new x86 CPU for gaming PCs, we'd be losing our minds. The A19 Pro is scoring nearly 4,000 points in Geekbench 6's single-thread test. That compares with about 3,500 for the best AMD desktop CPU . And may I remind you, that's in a freaking phone. The A19 Pro in a desktop with the power budget and thermals that affords would be higher still, well over 4,000. If a new AMD or Intel CPU popped up in Geekbench hitting, say, 4,500, the internet would just about break. And to be clear, these Geekbench numbers for the A19 Pro are plausible. The previous-gen A18 Pro scores around 3,500 points in Geekbench 6. So, a 15% boost to 4,000 points for the latest chip fitted to a phone with a new vapor chamber cooling system doesn't seem like a massive stretch. Of course, Geekbench is hardly the perfect benchmark. And it's demonstrably not a game. But comparative real-world performance in applications doesn't tend to be a million miles away from Geekbench.

Enemies that explode when they die, darts that explode when they're thrown, bounce orbs that also explode—and worst of all, pools of maggots that will strip you of your ability to heal (after being exploded by said orbs). It's also home to one of the most obnoxious runbacks in Silksong's entire library. For the record, you can find a slightly-closer bench located in the screenshot below. It's down at the bottom of a shaft with a pool of worms at its base—just break the wall to your right instead of going left. (Image credit: Team Cherry) Even here, though, the runback sucks. Groal the Great, the boss at the top of Bilewater, can only be fought after several waves of arena combat against those same obnoxious bastards you've been trying to avoid just to get to the guy. I, however, have discovered an absolute cheese of a strategy: Embrace the maggots. Become one with the worms. No, seriously. You'll still need to put in a bit of work, unfortunately. Groal can still occasionally whomp you with this strat, so you'll want to go into your fight with him wielding as m…",

Henry of Skalitz, lovable medieval yokel and protagonist of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (and 1, for that matter), which makes it all the more impressive that the game's recent 1.4 patch snuck in a new secret ending (via GamesRadar ) for those players who manage to single-handedly annihilate an entire enemy army. Uncovered by an industrious Redditor , the new ending can be found in the quest called The Lion's Den. That'd be the one where Henry infiltrates the camp of King Sigismund's army and solves a murder: heavy on sneaking about, investigation, and social skills. Unless you're cool, that is. In which case, you stroll into camp, draw your sword, and promptly massacre like a billion enemy soldiers. Make your way through enough of them, and you'll eventually hit a new endgame screen, reading \"You changed history! Sigismund lost his army and returned to Hungary in disgrace.\" You see? Indiv…",

Our QA team are working right now to identify the source of these bugs and fix them.\" The 0.9 update will include the ranged skill tree including new ammo and potions, a new weapon type, skill spells, journal updates, a control overhaul for those playing with controllers, and a handful of features yet to be announced. So, plenty of new content to really sink your teeth into. In addition, this update also sees the addition of creative mode and custom world settings which let you fine-tune your experience by tweaking things like hunger and thirst rates, and making your world unique to you. When the 0.9 update was originally announced via the Dragonwilds blog , the full extent of world customisation sliders was briefly shown off, and let me tell you, there are far more options than I was expecting.
