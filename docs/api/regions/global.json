The Galaxy S22 series has moved from monthly to quarterly security updates as the end of its support life draws closer. Samsung’s typical seven-year update promise only arrived with the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S phones now come with seven years of software support as standard, but that promise only kicked in with the Galaxy S24 series. Older flagships are still bound by the update policies in place when they launched, and for the Galaxy S21 lineup, it looks like the end has arrived. According to the latest security update listings published on SamsungMobile.com (via SamMobile ), the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra no longer appear on any of the company’s monthly or quarterly update schedules. That’s a clear indication that these phones are no longer set to receive regular OS updates or security patches. As usual, an update could still arrive if a critical vulnerability demands it, but routine updates appear to be over.",

By pushing more intelligence onboard, missions can move from passively collecting data to actively interpreting and responding to changing surface conditions in near-real time, enabling more targeted observations and dramatically improving the value of data returned to the ground. Within this context, land-focused applications such as regenerative agriculture, sustainable forestry, and broader land resilience efforts stand to benefit enormously from satellites that can adapt what, when, and how they sense based on dynamic environmental signals and algorithmic insight rather than fixed schedules or static acquisition plans. NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) invites participants to design small satellite (SmallSat) mission concepts that leverage adaptive sensing and onboard processing to enhance regenerative agriculture, forestry, or a similar land resilience objective.​ Participants must work within onboard power, compute, and bandwidth constraints characteristic of SmallSat missions, focusing on how to orchestrate exist…",

TL;DR Google is updating Pixel’s vague Adaptive Connectivity with clearer controls in Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2. There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

This would be the first time that Samsung plans to produce more Folds than Flips from the outset. This comes after the Galaxy Z Fold 7 reportedly outsold the Galaxy Z Flip 8 last year, despite Samsung originally planning to make more Flips. Samsung traditionally produces more Flip phones than Fold devices in a given year, as Flip foldables are significantly cheaper and tend to see more demand. However, it sounds like Samsung is planning to flip (heh) the script in 2026. Korean outlet ET News reports that Samsung plans to produce more Galaxy Z Fold 8 units than Galaxy Z Flip 8 devices this year. The website, citing industry sources, says Samsung will make 3.5 million Galaxy Z Fold 8 devices in 2026 versus 2.5 to 3 million Z Flip 8 units.",

While Samsung typically launches earbuds alongside its foldables at mid-year, it may release the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro earlier than usual, alongside the Galaxy S26 series later this month. And, the chief focus for these flagship earbuds would be reliability. According to industry sources cited by Korea’s ET News , Samsung’s efforts with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 series aim to regain consumer trust.

This report, according to Ookla, is based on speed tests performed by millions of users across the US. According to Ookla’s findings, T-Mobile’s average network speed stood at roughly 260Mbps, while its average 5G speed was nearly 310Mbps. Verizon, on the other hand, only recorded an average top speed of about 130Mbps, less than half of T-Mobile’s.",

The technology could debut on the OPPO Find X10 series and the photography-focused HUAWEI Nova 16 series, scheduled for launch later this year or early next year. A square sensor allows users to take landscape or portrait selfies without physically rotating the phone by cropping into the sensor. One of the most underrated upgrades on the iPhone 17 series is the new 18MP “Center Stage” front camera. While the camera itself is great, the party trick is that it uses a square sensor. This allows users to take selfies in landscape and portrait orientations without physically rotating their phone, as the company crops into the sensor for the shot. Android users could soon join in on the fun, as Android brands have started exploring a square selfie camera for their upcoming phones. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Credit: Tom Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR The Nothing Headphone (a) is reportedly launching on March 12, with pre-orders starting around March 5. It is rumored to cost €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is roughly half of the Headphone 1. The leak suggests four color options: black, white, pink, and yellow. Nothing is reportedly about to break the premium-only mold it set with the Headphone 1 . After turning heads with its transparent-design over-ears and solid feature set last year, the brand is now said to be readying a more affordable sibling, and the pricing could surprise you. A new report from Dealabs says the launch is set for March 12, 2026, with pre-orders starting around March 5 (via Notebookcheck ). The big news is the expected price: about €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is about half of what the original Headphone 1 cost at launch. This price drop puts Nothing in direct competition with mid-range headphones from brands like JBL and Sony, which is unexpected for a company known for its premium look and pricing.",

We’re heading closer to the official Galaxy S26 series unveiling later this month. It would be interesting to note how Samsung keeps us engaged during the Unpacked event, especially since most information about the phones has already leaked. And new leaks just don’t stop coming. While the overall designs of the new Galaxy S26 phones have broken cover multiple times, leaks around other tidbits are gaining momentum. And today, we’re looking at the Galaxy S26 Ultra in the different color options. The leak comes from Russian retailer Cifrus.ru , which appears to have listed the Galaxy S26 Ultra in different colors. Although the listings have since been removed, SammyGuru obtained images of Galaxy S26 Ultra renders in various colors.",

ESPN’s daily revenue loss was over $7 million per day, totaling a loss of over $110 million in operational revenue. Last year, in October, Google announced it was in negotiations with Disney to keep networks like ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV. As the two parties failed to reach an agreement before the then-existing licensing deal expired, a Disney media blackout ensued. Although both corporations were predicted to lose millions during the blackout, the situation wasn’t resolved until mid-November . Now we’re starting to learn just how big a financial impact that blackout had on Disney. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

In a new Google Home changelog today , the company says it has improved “close-to-live playback” for cameras in the Google Home app. That means the app should now be much better at playing back clips that were recorded moments ago, reducing those all-too-familiar “Video not available” errors when you tap a notification or open a recent event.",

Update: February 2, 2026 (3:37 PM ET): Shortly after we initially published our coverage of this Nest Hub app issue, Google shared a message in the original Reddit thread, acknowledging the problem and stating that work was underway on a fix. Over the weekend, Google followed that message up with the announcement that the missing-app problem was now resolved. We can confirm that everything seems back to normal on our own displays.",

That setting is now broadly available, as Google addresses confusion surrounding the feature. The software on our phones is constantly being updated, so we’re well aware that the appearance and functionality of apps can change on even a day-to-day basis. But last year, Android users found themselves scratching their heads about one change in particular: Google’s Phone app adding support for a landscape-style interface . Was it a bug? Was it a feature? Who was even asking for this in the first place? After a few bumpy months, it now looks like we’re finally at the end of this weird saga.

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR The AYANEO Pocket S Mini retail units will have a 4,700mAh battery, rather than the advertised 6,000mAh. A miscommunication in production caused the mistake, which went unnoticed until today. Buyers can either receive a full refund or a free 2+32GB Pocket AIR Mini with their orders. AYANEO is clearly making an effort to improve its company image, but a major production mistake just torpedoed its efforts to speed up shipping in the worst possible way. Just a few days after the Pocket S Mini was surprisingly put up for sale and set to ship within the same week, it was discovered that one of the main components didn’t match the intended specs. Initially advertised to ship with a 6,000mAh battery, the Pocket S Mini went into urgent production in order to ship before the Chinese New Year, which kicks off next week. However, it was discovered that the retail units slated to start shipping today actually have 4,700mAh batteries.",

She loves it too, especially after it recently got a surprise Android OS update beyond its promised allocation. I’d certainly miss OnePlus if it left the Android smartphone market, but I assumed you might be more split on your level of support for the brand. According to our poll, I may have assumed wrong. As those of you with your finger on the pulse will be aware, we didn’t ask this question as a pure hypothetical. A surprising report last month claimed that OnePlus may be winding down its smartphone operation, and we polled you on your feelings about it in our coverage. OnePlus has since dismissed the report as false, so it might be nothing, but my colleague Joe Maring argued that losing OnePlus would be bad for Android and the US smartphone industry as a whole. The crux of his argument in his subsequent article was that, like it or not, the OEM often leads the way with innovations that push its rivals, and that competition in such a huge tech field is generally a good thing.

In fact, it’s much more locked down than the Kindle Fire tablets that allow you to sideload regular Android apps. The Echo line doesn’t enjoy that privilege. But thanks to a new open-source project, you can now jailbreak select Echo Show 5 and Show 8 models and replace Amazon’s locked-down Fire OS with full-fledged Android. Under the hood, Amazon’s smart displays pack similar specifications as mainstream Android devices. For instance, the second-gen Show 5 relied on MediaTek’s MT8163 chip, which also powered the Kindle Fire HD 8 tablet and several budget phones like the Nokia 5.1. However, Amazon has never permitted unlocking the bootloader on its smart displays, keeping us locked to the Alexa-centric Fire OS ecosystem.",

The most buzzworthy is the iPhone Fold , which is expected to debut alongside the iPhone 18 later at Apple’s yearly September event. Much before its launch, the iPhone Fold is already shaping trends with its unusual “wider” aspect ratio and driving Android brands to adopt the same . Apple’s next foldable, however, could be far more conventional. While the first Apple foldable has yet to hit the shelves, the industry is buzzing with speculation about the second.

The premium 4.2-inch, 4:3 handheld has a powerful G3x Gen 2 SoC and starts at $319 for the month of February, with a free gift pack. AYANEO has done the unthinkable. The company that has been the target of so many shipping complaints over the years just shadowdropped its latest Pocket S Mini handheld, skipping crowdfunding and pre-order periods altogether. Ok, so it’s not quite a complete shadowdrop, since the company has teased the Pocket S Mini since September , but now we finally have full specs and pricing. As the name implies, it has the same premium design language as the Pocket S, with an all-metal CNC frame and an all-glass front. The 4.2-inch 4:3 LCD panel appears to be the same one as the budget Pocket Air Mini (though the company promises it’s been improved), and it’s the ideal resolution for retro games.",

However, in true Apple fashion, there are still lots of missing and potentially old-school features in the new tag, including the lack of cross-platform compatibility (because Apple, duh). This leaves the field of Bluetooth tracker competitors very much alive and blooming, and since I’ve been testing many of these trackers for the last 18 months, I’ll let you in on a secret: There are better trackers out there that work both on Android and iOS, and you should buy them instead.",

    "body": "I’ve been an early adopter of Google’s smart home ecosystem, using their devices and assistants since the very first iteration. But it’s safe to say that for the longest time, the promise of a digital assistant has been stuck in a cycle of setting kitchen timers and reading out the weather. Google Assistant, Siri, and even the newer Gemini integrations are essentially voice-activated search engines with a few smart home toggles attached. They operate within a very specific, very safe sandbox. While agentic control of your smartphone seems to be the future — and despite experimental projects like the Rabbit R1 attempting to bridge that gap — we haven’t quite seen a truly seamless implementation come to fruition just yet. For years, the promise of a digital assistant has boiled down to kitchen timers and weather updates. This frustration isn’t limited to mobile devices. Even in a desktop environment, these assistants quickly reach their limits. If you want to move a file from your downloads folder to a specific project directory based on its contents, or if you want to scrape a website and format that data into a local spreadsheet, these assistants simply hit a wall.

We look forward to building upon those capabilities with many private astronaut missions to come.” Axiom Mission 5 is expected to spend up to 14 days aboard the space station. A specific launch date will depend on overall spacecraft traffic at the orbital outpost and other planning considerations. “The International Space Station is a critical platform for enabling commercial industry in low Earth orbit,” said Dana Weigel, manager, International Space Station Program, NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “Private astronaut missions allow the station to be used as a proving ground for new markets and technologi…",

The device runs Android 14 and supports stylus input, an optional keyboard, and 4G LTE connectivity. Pre-orders are live now, with pricing starting at $699 and shipping expected mid-February. As color E-Ink tablets edge closer to traditional tablets, Bigme has officially announced the B10. The generously sized device is positioned as a productivity-first tablet for reading, writing, and, with an optional keyboard, light work. The B10 is designed to deliver the paper-like experience associated with E Ink while still behaving more like a tablet than a traditional e-reader. It features a 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display that tops out at 2480 x 1860 resolution in black and white, with 1240 x 930 specs for color. It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools. The device also supports varied text input, with stylus support for handwriting and sketching, plus an optional magnetic keyboard case.

The logs show support for the Android Virtualization Framework, a key requirement that was missing on Samsung’s last flagship. With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android. The tool lets Android run a full Linux environment directly on the device, but Samsung’s own flagships were left out. Despite having the right hardware on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra didn’t support it. However, we’ve spotted signs that this may finally change with the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

Then we’ve got the budget crowd who just wants to find the most affordable streaming solution around. But then, there are the power users.
