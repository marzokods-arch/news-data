    "body": "With 2026 in full swing, there’s no doubt that the “new year, new me” mentality has kicked in. And as tradition holds, Billboard has curated the ultimate playlist to kickstart your year on a strong and positive note. Titled “New Year, New Me: El 2026 Playlist,” the list includes more than one hour of feel-good music, mainly charged with powerful affirmations turned into lyrics. In songs such as Karol G’s “Milagros,” Bad Bunny’s “Estamos Bien” and “Bendecido” by Dale Pututi and Gente de Zona&#8217;s Randy Malcom, the artists share sentiments about feeling at peace, being blessed in their personal lives and having successful careers. Beéle’s “Algo Bueno,” Elena Rose’s “La De Dios,” and Yami Safdie and Camilo’s “Querida Yo,” on the other hand, are tracks that reflect on self-love, evolution and the importance of manifestation because the best is yet to come. “Evil wants to trap me, but it won&#8217;t succeed/ I have angels protecting me, where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way/ It&#8217;s never too late to be reborn/ You will always see the best part of me,&#8221; Beéle sings on his smooth Afrobeats track.

He lived at a modest traditional British home in southeast London that had a living and dining room/kitchen downstairs, and two bedrooms upstairs with his family, and dreamed of becoming a musical great. That fabled house, 4 Plaistow Grove in Bromley, is now set to be a place of pilgrimage for Bowie fans when it is restored and reopened to the public in the coming years. The home, where Bowie lived between ages 8 and 20, has been acquired by the Heritage of London Trust in a landmark purchase. The premises will restore the house back to its original early 1960s appearance and is set to open to the public in late 2027.&nbsp; Bowie was born in Brixton, south London, and moved to the property with his mother and father in 1955. He lived at the premises until 1967, around the time that he released his self-titled debut album on Decca Records, though he returned often in the following years. The announcement of the heritage project comes on what would have been Bowie’s 79th birthday (Jan. 8), and just days before the 10th anniversary of his Jan. 10, 2016, passing.

Now that holiday music has retreated from the Hot 100 for the season, “Choosin’ Texas” accelerates into the top five, earning Langley her first career top 10 hit. In the process, she joins a notably small group of women to score a top 10 Hot 100 hit this century with a country song. Just how rare is that feat? Dating back to 2000, only 12 women or all-female groups have charted in the Hot 100’s top 10 with a country song, defined as songs eligible for Billboard ’s Hot Country Songs chart. And across the past 26 years, just 24 country songs by women have reached the top tier of the Hot 100. To add some context and perspective to that, 1,512 total songs have reached the top 10 of the chart this century, and of those, just 60 were country songs. That’s just 3.96%. And of that, 1.6% of all top 10s this century have been country songs by women. Even with that limited pool, many of the entries come with qualifiers…",

The problem hasn’t been power or even cutting ability. Modern robotic mowers are more than capable of trimming grass cleanly and consistently. Where things have historically fallen apart is navigation. A mower that can’t reliably understand where it is or where to go will always need more babysitting than most people expect from an “autonomous” machine.",

Segway Navimow addresses both of these concerns and more with their latest robot lawn mowers. Navimow showed off five new lineups at CES 2026 – four ideal for residential use, while a new series marks the brand’s first foray into commercial lawn mowing. The i2, H2, X4, and Terranox series address very different yard types, from simple suburban lawns to complex, obstacle-dense landscapes and extreme terrain. And most importantly, they make lawn maintenance a breeze.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google might have begun working on navigation support for Android XR using Google Maps. Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.

You’ll be able to add AI-generated weather effects to your lock screen wallpaper based on local weather conditions. Effects like rain or snowfall realistically move behind visible objects or people, rather than simply sitting on top of the wallpaper image. Smartphone brands have been paying extra attention to the lock screen lately, treating it as more than just a place to check notifications or check the time. From richer widgets to personalized wallpapers, the smartphone lock screen is becoming more personal, useful, and visually engaging. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update looks set to continue that trend with a new weather-driven feature that adds a bit of magic to your wallpaper, and closely mirrors a similar idea Google already offers on Pixel phones.

Combined with the $.50 hike in April of 2025, fees are up about $1 in less than a year. The vague fee structure continues to draw criticism, though grandfathered plans with taxes and fees included are unaffected. Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees. We’ve already seen the company increase its telco fees as recently as last April, but it looks like the company is doing it again. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The feature is likely to be an opt-in tool for game developers, helping them attract users who are hesitant about upfront costs. The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it.

Fortunately, we didn’t have to wait long for the unveiling, as Motorola has just launched the device. The Motorola Signature is the first phone in the brand’s new Signature series, and it emphasizes a slick design and premium extras. Starting with the design, Moto says the phone is 6.99mm thick and has an aluminum frame. The Signature is available in Pantone Martini Olive with a twill-inspired finish, or Pantone Carbon with a linen-inspired finish. Motorola’s phone also packs Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection and IP68/69 ratings.",

Punkt may not be a household name, but it’s also not brand new to the smartphone world. The company launched its MC02 phone in February 2024 with the same goal of creating a privacy-focused handset.

It has said that it only delivers software after testing, refuting Google’s plan to split updates into crucial and optional updates. However, it has said that it will resume updates in January 2026. In 2019, Google set out to split Android updates into two parts, so it could deliver crucial features directly to users without needing manufacturers to first adapt them to their custom skins. These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section. It’s alright if you never bothered to check these…",

At CES 2026 , smart or AR (augmented reality) glasses have been the clear choice for many brands to showcase their strides in AI. LLVision is throwing its hat in the ring, too, with a showcase of its Leion Hey 2 smart glasses at CES 2026. LLVision positions these smart glasses for professional use, with a heavy focus on translation. As per the announcement, the Leion Hey 2 glasses support over “100 languages and dialects” and offer real-time translation with less than half a second of processing delay.",

Gemini has been quietly expanding across Google’s ecosystem, and the company already announced that Gemini is coming to projectors .
