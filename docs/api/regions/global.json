The lawsuit was filed on behalf of children's digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—representing an estimated 14 million consumers in the UK. Very briefly, it alleges that Valve prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms, requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices. Valve had argued that the case should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action on a number of technical grounds, including that it will be difficult to accurately determine who is eligible to claim damages. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (via the BBC ) disagreed, however, declaring that \"the certification criteria were satisfied and it was appropriate to grant a CPO on an opt-out basis.\" A website dedicated to the action at steamyouow…",

Chainalysis puts this down as a 51% increase year-on-year for North Korea, and if accurate that would mean North Korea accounted for just under 60% of all global cryptocurrency theft, estimated at $3.4 billion in 2025. A major factor here was the February 2025 attack on Bybit, which the FBI attributed to North Korea , saying it made off with roughly $1.5 billion worth of digital assets. \"This marks the most severe year on record for DPRK crypto theft in terms of value stolen, with DPRK attacks also accounting for a record 76 percent of all service compromises,\" says the Chainalysis report. North Korean hackers have also stepped up their targeting of individuals, and were behind approximately 160,000 personal wallet attacks over the course of the year, stealing from around 80,000 people.

In fact, I can all but guarantee that once the Midnight Walkers launch time hits, any strolling taking place within the zombie-infested Liberty Grand Center commercial complex will be about as far from pleasant as you can get. But if you're here, I imagine a tense, perilous excursion into a derelict gigamall filled with ravenous undead and players who'll happily bludgeon you to death to steal whatever junk you've gathered is, ultimately, exactly what you're looking for. Well, look no longer: Here's when The Midnight Walkers unlocks in early access. When does The Midnight Walkers launch? The Midnight Walkers launches in early access at 6 pm PST on January 28 , as announced in a Steam news post by Oneway Ticket Studio. While that leaves the west coast of the US with some comfortable evening hours for zombie chopping, it means launch day players in Europe will be doing their Midnight Walking well after midnight. Here are the full Midnight Walkers unlock times for timezones around the world: Los Angeles: 6 pm PST on Wednesday, January 28 New York: 9 pm PST on…",

A not-insignificant number of people immediately wrote it off, calling it dead on arrival—the next Concord , if you will. Unsurprisingly, this, frankly, unjustified hatred of the very concept of Highguard being a game that exists has gone on to plague its launch. Despite pulling in nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch, it's currently sitting at an incredibly low 33% 'mostly negative' reviews. If you've ever played a truly terrible game, a real 33%, then you'd know Highguard is far from that . I can understand why people have been so quick to judge—Highguard is an awkward hodgepodge of genres that was poorly unveiled, and a sharp departure from the developer's penchant for movement shooters. I, for one, wish he had a spiritual successor to Titanfall, and Highguard isn't that. However, Highguard deserves its fair s…",

This is, of course, because up until yesterday New Vegas had absolutely no bespoke sneaking animation for its canine companion Rex.

Once you've got Dog Sneak Animations installed, dropping into a crouch (so long as you're out of combat) will have your pooch friend join you, shuffling along the floor flat on his legs like he's sidling up to you to say sorry for eating the sofa cushions.

On a call with PC Gamer ahead of the announcement, Emmert said that there's no hard feelings between him and NetEase over the Jackalyptic closure—\"strategies change, and I totally get it\"—but that he was \"down in the dumps\" until he got the call asking him to come back to Cryptic as CEO. \"I've been on cloud nine ever since, and it was just meant to be, I think,\" Emmert said about his homecoming. Cryptic, which Emmert co-founded 26 years ago and previously led as CEO from 2011 to 2016, has itself only survived the 2020s by the skin of its teeth.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Digitimes also notes that Samsung recently reported very strong financial results, with revenues up by over 22% to roughly $65 billion for the final quarter of 2025.

But between those periods he worked on one of the few actually good console real-time strategy games. Halo Wars was developed by Ensemble, the studio behind Age of Empires. But it wasn't the only Halo game Ensemble was involved in. It was also working on a Halo MMO. \"Part of it was that we loved MMOs,\" Fermier tells us. \"I still play World of Warcraft to this day, from day one. And it was a chance for us to bring something more action-oriented. I still feel like no-one has really done the action MMO I see in my mind.

(Image credit: Embark Studios) This is a big change from the usual augment, as until now, you couldn't carry any guns in your safe pockets. The only way you could stop other raiders from getting their grubby little hands on your precious Osprey or Venator was by disassembling them as quickly as possible before you got downed. While this new augment may not be entirely useful in the PvP lobbies, where most players actually give each other great guns instead of taking them away.

It's not just the fact that, as a generally not small woman, my feet don't touch the ground while sitting in this gaming chair, but also the fact I'm perched atop a 5000 mAh lithium ion battery. Yes, this is a $699 / £580 gaming chair offering an array of features that require a considerable amount of juice. But before we get into all of that, let us ask the most basic question: What is it like as a regular ol' gaming chair? Well, as previously mentioned, the first thing to get out of the way is that this is not really made for me; the XL or Plus edition of the DXRacer Martian Series is intended for folks up to 180 cm tall, and is designed to support a weight of up to 125 kg.

According to Steam user Captain_SmellyRat (excellent), the game's resolution is tied to its post processing setting, which means lowering it drops the output resolution in turn—despite reporting otherwise in the settings menu. Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%. Turn post processing to High, and the game runs at full 4K.

We’ve always believed that players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them.\" In an interview this month, managing director Maciej Gołębiewski referred to Horses when he declared that \"We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values\". That rankled some onlookers who remembered that, well, that wasn't always GOG's stance. In 2020, it came under fire for unceremoniously dumping Devotion , which had become subject of repression in China for memes seemingly mocking president Xi Jinping. In a new interview with Eurogamer , Gołębiewski chatted a bit about how GOG looks back on that episode. \"That situation remains difficult to reflect on,\" said Gołębiewski. \"At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game…",

The company just announced on its website that \"the current situation is extremely serious—serious enough to raise concerns about the very survival of graphics card manufacturers and distributors going forward.\" That's according to X user and tech talker harukaze5719's translation , which aligns pretty closely with Google's machine translation. The company claims that not only has the price of the RTX 5090 \"increased sharply\", but also for the RTX 5060. Presumably it's referring to the price the company is paying Nvidia for the GPUs. Because of these increased prices, Zotac Korea is cutting its rewards points policy.

But not only is he completely disinterested in publishing more than around 10 games a year, focusing on stability over growth , his advice to indie developers is to avoid indie publishers entirely. \"People can hate me for this if they want,\" he says, \"but most indie publishers are not people indie developers should work with. The vast majority of indie publishers, in their whole structure, are predatory and opportunistic.\" This could all be a cunning ploy to stick it to the competition, but Hooded Horse isn't exactly struggling to find developers to sign. Bender's warning to devs is also consistent with the rest of his publishing philosophy, where \"ethical treatment of developers is critical\".

It now supports gyro controls, much like the Steam Controller, with one gyroscope in each half of the controller. Gyro functionality is, creator TommyB says, \"a little noisy\" at the moment, but he's looking into ways to improve this and use the dual-gyroscopes to better effect in-game. Each half of the controller also features a slim screen down the inside edge. One of the larger overhauls here is a shift away from Arduino to the Nordic nRF Connect SDK.

In Movie Night's most complicated step, Apollo sends you to the Cultural Archives to find the Stack of Movie Tapes, which you'll then have to extract to deliver to him.

Nvidia previously announced a new Arm processor called Vera and based on custom-designed CPU cores. Now the company has announced an initial customer for the chip and emphasised that it is the first time it has supplied a CPU as a separate product. Bloomberg reports on a new deal between Nvidia and cloud services outfit CoreWeave that forms the basis of what is effectively the launch of the Vera CPU. In what has become a typically circular form for the AI industry of late, Nvidia is investing $2 billion in Coreweave, while the latter will buy up to $6 billion in Nvidia hardware, including those Vera chips. Bloomberg says the Vera CPU will be competing with server chips from Intel and AMD, along with other cloud computing processors such as Amazon's Graviton. But not all that much is known about Nvidia's Vera CPU. Nvidia has previously said that it runs a new custom-designed Arm core called Olympus.

They went on to explain that they were an avid modder, digging into the guts of games like Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire to tweak the progression curves of player stats⁠—which is about as granular a difficulty modifier as you can get. They further asked for Sawyer's thoughts on the cost/benefit analysis of letting players get so far into the weeds \"officially,\" or at least baking in the modding freedom to do so. \"If it cost nothing⁠—which it does not⁠—then I would say let players in-game set their difficulty options however they like,\" said Sawyer. \"And when it comes to exposing data tables and letting players mod that stuff, let 'em do whatever the heck they want.\" The nature of this question has changed over the course of h…",

It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map.

At full capacity, it's more like a small skeletal squad. You can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians. They aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire only seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments.

Whether or not additional XP is enough of a draw to actually get anyone to choose the new matchmaking option is another question.

As for Europe… well, now you need to stay up extremely late or get up quite a bit earlier if you want to catch them the moment they become available. \"Good morning, Vault Dwellers!\" Fallout's official X account posted today . \"Due to strong participation and interest, we have amended the start times for the remaining Season Two presentations.

Official Highguard promotion stopped as soon as it started, which prompted a swell of spectators (largely on X, the misery app) to declare Highguard the next Concord and question if it would be delayed or cancelled outright. Speaking with Wildlight at a hands-on event in Los Angeles last week, several Highguard devs admitted they wished the reveal had gone down differently, but made it clear that the mixed reception didn't alter their release plans. \"Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better,\" Wildlight Entertainment CEO and founder Dusty Welch told PC Gamer. \"Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand.

That's my takeaway from a recent chat that Nightdive CEO (and System Shock Remake director) Stephen Kick had with FRVR . \"They don’t perform financially the same way that other genres do,\" said Kick. \"It’s a known fact, you make an imsim game you’re going to be appealing to a very small, niche group of fans that are going to love it, they’re going to be very vocal about it, and they’re going to try to convince their friends to play it, and they may or not be successful.\" That small, niche group of people is me and, I'd hazard to guess, you. But apparently we don't represent a market demographic large enough to move the C-suites of the world. So why does Nightdive keep working on them?

But there's a significant caveat hanging over the Intel Arc B390, and it goes like this: it's very, very quick— for an iGPU. Sure, it's capable of delivering gaming laptop-like performance, but compare it to any discrete mobile GPU of the current generation and the little graphics tile's limits are quickly revealed. Now, none of this is meant to cast shade upon the considerable achievement of Intel's engineers. No one was expecting its new mobile graphics hardware to compete with, say, anything from the RTX 50-series. In fact, Intel claims the Core Ultra X9 388H is 10% faster at gaming (on average) than a lappy with an RTX 4050 mobile. And, if you squint closely at those claims, you'll see that they were made in reference to a 60 W gaming laptop, with '2x upscaling' enabled.
