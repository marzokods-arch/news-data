This is the Hotel Stella Montis, and while I'm sure its accommodations are lovely, it owes its recent influx of praise to the other Stella Montis —the popular Arc Raiders map that's driving players to flood the Italian hotel with reviews celebrating its lively (if occasionally hostile) guests, lootable blueprints, and proactive robotic security (via Arc Raiders Alerts on X). A reviewer by the name of Bad Wolf kicked off the bit about a month ago, saying that while \"everything is great\" about the hotel, \"the only issue is that players sometimes spawn just 10 meters away from me.\" In the weeks since, all but one review—left by guests who enjoyed a \"ski-related stay\"—have been Arc Raiders references, ranging from the simple \"Hey, Raider! Don't shoot!\" to warnings that other guests be wary of hostile Arcs if they're passing through ventilation shafts.

Per the description on Just the Browser's Github page, the project is a script that, when run, will \"remove AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from web browsers.\" On Windows, all you have to do is open PowerShell as administrator and copy-paste this command: & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/main/main.ps1\"))) The script will then ask you which browser you wish to de-AI, with support for Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Press a couple keys and you're done. It's just as simple to run in the terminal on Mac or Linux. To set expectations, Just the Browser does not touch anything on the actual websites you visit, which means you're still going to be seeing AI crap all over the place. It is not a silver bullet.

German news site Taz (Die Tageszeitung) published an interview this week with Turbodriver, the modder behind Wicked Whims and its less naughty equivalent Wonderful Whims. It's a bit of a drive-by in which Turbodriver only briefly touches on topics like being compensated for modding, access to adult content online, and whether he finds his mods controversial. The details about himself he's willing to share (his identity not among them), mostly boil down to not seeing himself as an educator or an activist. Wicked Whims has contraception, explicit sex, and abortion, but that's in pursuit of the realism that players want more than making a statement, he claims.

Beast of Reincarnation was first unveiled last June, and its unique visual identity really speaks to me. The beautiful Japanese countryside, mystical elements, and samurai protagonist (complete with wide-brimmed kasa ) remind me of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, but the postapocalyptic world is also suffused with overgrown, rusted megastructures and gangly automatons that call to mind Square Enix's beloved Nier series.

The series was \"a big pivot\" for Bethesda, best known for the high fantasy of The Elder Scrolls, says lead artist Istvan Pely, who was responsible for much of the game's look: \" It started with the box art .\" One crucial element of that look was the presence of firearms, from pistols to energy blasters, which in Fallout 3 have a kind of chunky and utilitarian feel to them. \"The Fallout guns are very exaggerated, they're almost like caricatures of guns in some qualities,\" says Pely. \"Usually, we try to stick with vintage pre-war realistic guns. But then there's a whole class of the more futuristic stuff, like the energy weapons.\" One of Pely's first designs was the power armour, which turns its wearers into hulking mini-mechs, and this would also feed into how Pely thought about the weapons. \"The assault rifle from Fallout 4 originally didn't start out as an assault rifle, it was meant to be a gun that was scaled and suitable for a guy in massive power armor,\" says Pely. \"In…",

There's also dungeon diving, where you'll rummage up the gold you need to buy wares from community merchants, and you can join clans and form villages and even castles if you've got enough people playing with you. Despite my preference for solo experiences, the emphasized focus on community building is so far off what I usually go for that it's swung around to interesting for me, and the fact the game is free to play until Monday, January 26 means I'm tempted to dip into it this weekend and see if I gel with it.

But it's also not a super difficult game—it's fairly easy to assemble a party that can make mincemeat of any foe they happen across. Would it have done better if, instead of its more general backer beta that focused on player response to the game as a whole, it had adopted a Baldur's Gate 3-style early access period, where an early portion of the game was released and used to aggressively fine-tune balance in particular? Its director, Josh Sawyer, doesn't think so. \"I still think we would have had the same issues,\" said Sawyer in response to a question from a fan. \"A lot of the issues were evident because they got magnified over the course of the game—the later you get in the game, the more the balance gets out of wack, just because there are more numbers inputting into the system.\" After all, BG3's balance wasn't perfect. \"This is not a slam against BG3, but just sort of recognition: at launch, a lot of people really did not speak fondly of how the third act of …",

But despite me thoroughly enjoying using the Pulsar X2 CrazyLight, it probably won't be the best option out there for many competitive FPS gamers. If you aren't familiar with the company's line-up of gaming mice, looking at Pulsar's product pages can be very confusing. Even just looking at the X2 series , there are a whole bunch of different models there. There are 'A' versions which are ambidextrous, 'H' versions which have a bigger 'hump' to them, and so on, plus different size variations. It's the medium-sized X2 CrazyLight that I've been spending time with, although I have also tried the CrazyLight X2H in mini sizing. Apart from being a little too small for my hand, I also found the hump in the latter too pronounced for my liking and a little distracting, so I've stuck to considering the regular one for this review.

It's a pretty short scene, the Super Mutant actually rescues the Ghoul from a nasty fate after getting punched out of a window and impaled on a pole, and then drags him to an unknown location, supposedly where other Super Mutants are living. The mutant then asks the Ghoul to join his cause of going after the Enclave. After Coop refuses, he gets knocked out and dragged away from the hideout. (Image credit: Prime Video) That's all the time I needed. I had thought we'd see a Super Mutant at some point in the show, especially after FEV was properly mentioned in the last episode, but I didn't expect they'd get Perlman to voice it.

In case you're unfamiliar, D&D Beyond is a digital tabletop version of the TTRPG that Wizards of the Coast bought in 2022.

Ingold was a mathematical consultant on The Imitation Game, the movie about Alan Turing inventing the first computer to break the Enigma code in World War 2, so this seems right up his alley. The reveal that TR-49 was made in just nine months is very impressive on its own. The fact that it's also the best launch Inkle has ever had makes it even more so.

Today, those same graphics cards are, at best, $450, $829, and $1,268.

The standout feature of Update is no doubt its improved mining experience. Pickaxes have been reworked to make higher-quality picks mine faster (frankly, I was baffled that wasn't how they worked initially). Building on that, while WorldGen V2 still isn't here, Hypixel has changed how ores are spawned. Namely, major ores are better distributed between the tiered zones, and there's much more ore overall, especially in the Devastated Lands. I still think Lucky Mining is one of the best Hytale mods , but these changes go a long way in making mining and gear progression feel more rewarding. Another major…",

In the release notes for Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26220.7653 , the known issue on PC is described as, \"some apps [behaving] unexpectedly when using FSE, particularly those that expect to be locked to a given size or launch additional windows.\" The issue isn't completely fixed yet, with the Insider Team continuing to \"validate scenarios and as such keeping the known issue active for now.\" It's worth noting that FSE is more sophisticated than a straightforward full-screen mode, aiming to improve gaming performance by minimising many of Windows 11's background tasks. However, depending on your platform of choice, you may not necessarily see huge gains—and an early YouTuber experiment suggests that Linux-based gamer OS Bazzite p…",

Taking a leaf from Zenless Zone Zero's book, Endfield is all about party elements (called 'arts' here) and combo skills, establishing little synergies with your team that'll let you effectively 1-2 enemies, perform arts reactions, or buff the art your team is using. The best Arknights: Endfield characters are strong either because they're great at a very specific role, such as how Xaihi is the meta Cryo support character, or they're super versatile, like how Ardelia and Akekuri will work in basically any team comp. Still, there are team combos for each art which are very strong when put together. Some of these are more free-to-play friendly than others, with Electric and Physical/Cryo making for great free teams, while mono-Physical squads are currently among the most costly if you want them to perform at peak.

But it's a tectonic shift in how the game is designed and played. Players have been used to comprehensive and game-warpingly powerful combat addons for over 20 years at this point, so of course it's kicking up a fuss. Game director Ion Hazzikostas, who talked to PCG contributor Heather Newman recently , has spent a lot of his time dutifully reassuring players, reiterating intentions, and trying to disarm panic. Now the conversation's shifted in another direction: Has Blizzard gone soft on addons, by walking back some of the changes and specifics? No, says Hazzikostas, that was always the plan. As a matter of fact, when Midnight went into alpha testing, the strategy was to first go scorched-earth and see how much broke. \"I was surprised, and I learned a lot about exactly how many of our add-ons are written in the first few weeks of alpha … We realized pretty quickly that a ton of these add-ons were written …",

Turns out, if you build an entire game around requiring 12 separate WeakAuras (programmable UI elements) and nameplate mods, that's not the best experience for anybody.

    "body": "How low can you go? A simple question, but one with intriguing and occasionally hilarious results when applied to PC gaming and upscaling. The answer, apparently, is 77p or thereabouts. Yep, not 720p or any other triple-digit vertical res, but a very countable 77 vertical pixels. Yikes. This all comes courtesy of YouTuber 2kliksphilip, who did the dirty work so you don't have to . He set himself the task of achieving the lowest possible base resolution in Red Dead Redemption 2 and then applying various upscaling technologies to compare the results. Turns out they vary from absolutely awful to still-kinda-potatovision-but-better-than-you'd-probably-guess, if that's not an unforgivably excessive use hyphenation and compound adjectives. Anywho, to go lower than 720p, for starters you actually have to edit Red Dead Redemption 2's config file. 2kliksphilip first tried 120p base resolution, then 90p. At this point, text and menu controls get very hard to read even given those elements are rendered at the upscaled resolution, which is double the vertical pixel count but still very low. Next he tried 60p and the game crashes. Turns out there's a lower limit on game rendering. \"The technol…",

    "body": "Once upon a time, ordering food online was not the nightmare of soaring platform pricing and underpaid gig workers we know today—dare I say it, there was once even a little room for whimsy. For instance, the Nintendo Wii once allowed Japanese gamers to place an order at a local restaurant right there on the console. Taking its name from food delivery platform Demae-Can, the Demae Channel was deactivated back in 2017 and the feature was never available outside of Japan—until now. YouTuber Retro Game Attic recently documented the process of ordering from his local Domino's via the Food Channel, a homebrew resurrection of the Demae Channel that brings the Wii's food delivery functionality Stateside for the first time. Peering at a fuzzy CRT (the Wii was a standard definition console), lengthy loads on the 2006 console draw out the process of ordering—but a 14-inch hand tossed pizza with extra cheese does ultimately arrive (via Hackaday ). As Nintendo has long since shut down many of the official servers that once supported the Wii, the Food Channel is instead offered by Wii Link , which is an unofficial homebrew community project working to restore much of the console's online functi…",

Chatting to Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, who called Nvidia 'nuh-vidia' throughout the conversation, Huang had a few things to say about his booming business. \"One good test on the AI bubble is to recognize that Nvidia now has now millions of Nvidia GPUs in the cloud. We're in every cloud. You know. We're used everywhere. \"And if you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two generation old GPUs. The spot price of rentals are going up, and the reason for that is because the number of AI companies that are being created, the number of companies shifting their R&D budget.\" Nvidia's datacentre business, the topic of conversation here, has soared to many times its gaming revenue in recent years.

The idea is that proportionately things stay the same—you're not actually getting any weaker. However, WoW is a 21-year-old game, and sometimes things get a little skewiff. For example: There are now healing potions in World of Warcraft, potions that a first-time player might conceivably pick up, that do literally nothing. As spotted by one user on the game's subreddit , a Minor Healing Potion at the time of writing currently reads: \"Use: Restores 0 health.\" Not one for letting threads fool me, I decided to hop onto my character to verify and, surely enough, there are multiple healing potions and food items that currently restore zero, or \"-0\" health.

Sure, we don't really know who performs best in the endgame yet, and won't until after launch, but similar to Zenless Zone Zero, the usefulness of characters is primarily dependent on which type of team they perform best in. A character can be good because they're versatile and free-to-play friendly, or because they're currently the meta DPS or support for a specific art. Since Arknights: Endfield features elemental arts and combo skills which activate upon fulfilling specific conditions, such as reactions, team comp is the be-all and end-all. Currently, the top-tier teams are cryo and heat (though the latter has far fewer characters), though neither is free-to-play friendly, since they require six-star characters to shine. On the other hand, electric and cryo/physical hybrid teams are very free-to-play friendly, since most of the characters you need are four or five-stars. I'll rate each character below based on how valuable they are in their best team comp, or based on the fact that they're very strong and versatile, slotting into most teams, such as Gilberta, Ardelia, and Akekuri.

While I was laboriously putting that quiz together I noticed something interesting: a lot of games use a very stylized letter A in their logo. There are several logos where the A has someone standing inside it, a few with eyes or a face, and some shaped like an element from the game itself. I guess it's just a just a pleasantly flexible letter that designers can have a little fun with. So, I put together another letter quiz, and this time it's all about the letter A. I'll show you an A from a game logo, you type in what you think the game's name is. Don't worry, there aren't 26 of them this time. Let me know how you did in the comments!",

Players have somehow spent nearly 21,000 years collectively exploring Embervale, and Steam says I've contributed 300 hours towards that myself, so I'm not wagging my finger at anybody.

In a document released today Ubisoft describes its \"radically new value-creation\" business model, which it claims will help it become \"a more gamer-centric organization\" thanks to a \"rightsized and more agile organization\". It goes on: \"The new operating model will further empower the execution of the Group's strategy, centered on Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences, supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.\" Ubisoft's embrace of generative AI is nothing new. Last year the company revealed Teammates, a \"playable generative AI research project\" featuring AI-powered NPCs capable of dynamically interacting with the player.

Given the current RAMpocolypse , there's absolutely zero chance that a graphics card with 32 GB will be anything other than megabucks. B70 Pro soon. January 21, 2026 But first, let's cover what was actually said and by whom. X user Jaykihn, who has a strong record for accurate Intel leaks, posted, simply, \" B70 Pro soon. \" In the discussion that followed, Jaykihn confirmed with a clear \"yes\" when queried respectively whether the B70 Pro would be G31-based and have 32 GB of VRAM. So, there we have it. Intel's G31 Big Battlemage is coming soon and as a 32 GB Pro graphics card and not as the Intel Arc B770 gaming card we're all dying to see. That's according to this single, if usually reliable, source. Personally, I can believe it. Whether it's shipping manifests or driver references , there's just too much noise around the G31 G…",
