Adamantite is a rare, mid- to end-game material, and with that comes a pretty annoying and dangerous search. Don't worry though, I'll let you know where to look for adamantite ore so you can skip to the best bit: Smelting the ore into ingots and making powerful items. How to get adamantite in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) You can find adamantite ore on the surface and inside caves in the Devastated Lands, the volcanic fourth zone. The Devastated Lands is a very dangerous and gloomy area, so I recommend bringing the best gear you can currently craft, plenty of food, and lots of torches. As you'd expect, adamantite ore can spawn underground inside caves. I've found that the deeper you go, the better your chances of finding adamantite, though there are no strict spawning restrictions based on depth like Minecraft. Importantly, adamantite also…",

Cindercloth scraps are one such example, though they're not actually as hard to find as you might think. The main hurdle is that the area you need to reach isn't somewhere I'd recommend you visit on a vacation—too much lava and reanimated skeletons. Grab the best sword and armour you can craft (most likely thorium or cobalt), as both options for getting cindercloth scraps in Hytale require a fair bit of fighting. Don't worry, it'll be worth it for that sweet, sweet adamantite gear. How to get cindercloth scraps in Hytale (Image credit: Hypixel) The best way to get cindercloth scraps early on in Hytale is to kill fire-themed incandescent skeletons in the volcanic biome underground in the first zone, Emerald Grove. If you've not been to this area yet, explore deep underground caves in the starting zone until you see embers in the air, volcanic rock, and lots of lava—you'll know you're in the right place.

    "body": "As the memory supply crisis rages on, manufacturers are continuing to scale up operations in a bid to meet the accelerated demand. The latest memory maker to expand its production line is Micron, which has just signed a letter of intent to acquire Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation’s (PSMC) Tongluo chip foundry in Taiwan. The company's statement to its investors clarifies that this includes an existing 300 mm wafer cleanroom measuring 300,000 square feet, though none of the production equipment contained therein. In total, it's a deal to the tune of $1.8 billion that will encompass more than facilities, with Micron also hoping to establish a long-term business relationship with PSMC. This latest announcement follows recent comments from Micron's VP of Marketing, Christopher Moore, that \" there's just not enough supply to go around .\" However, while this eye-watering transaction is expected to complete during the second quarter of 2026, with Micron assuming control of the fab immediately after, the site isn't expected to contribute meaningfully to DRAM wafer output until the latter half of 2027. Simply put, even with this deal as well as SK Hynix accelerating its own…",

Wonky BIOS files and awkward connectors are easy enough to deal with, but it's a whole different story when it comes to Wi-Fi drivers. That's why Asus' new ROG Crosshair X870E Glacial is noteworthy, because it comes with those drivers pre-installed on the board. It's not the only spangly feature the X870E Glacial has; it's a high-end Asus model, after all. In fact, the mobo sports a veritable smorgasbord of gadgets, extras, and options , all designed to make it as user-friendly as possible. I also have to say that the whole thing really does look very nice. However, one of the last Asus motherboards I reviewed, the TUF Gaming B860M-Plus WiFi , was anything but user-friendly. That's because Asus uses one of three different Wi-Fi modules for this particular model, and there's no way of telling which one you've got without ripping the whole thing apart. That means you have to try three different Wi-Fi driver sets until you hit the right one. That's not much of a problem when you've already got Windows fully set up and running, but with Redmond making i…",

So you'd best bet that when I heard of a game where I could clean a room up and then decorate it with all sorts of furnishings however I pleased, I had a neuron activation moment. Hozy is exactly what I want when it comes to a cleaning sandbox puzzle: it's satisfying, cute, and surprisingly detailed.

Most of the materials at the start are pretty self-explanatory and easy enough to find in the relatively peaceful first zone, Emerald Grove. But soon enough you'll have to find rarer materials, such as sturdy chitin , and you're forced to venture out into tougher areas. Below, I'll outline where you can find sturdy chitin in Hytale, so you're not wandering aimlessly through the zones. I hope you like bugs because, I'll warn you now, the enemies you need to hunt down are truly horrifying. How to get sturdy chitin in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) You can get sturdy chitin from killing the following mobs in the Howling Sands zone , which is the desert biome: Scarak Defender, Fighter, Louse, Seeker, and Broodmother Scorpions Armadillos Tortoises Given that the relatively harmless mobs on the surface, like tortoise, only give one or two sturdy chitin each, your best bet is hunting down Scarak mobs, especially inside their underground nests. While exploring caves in the Howling Sands, keep an eye out for grey/brown spotty blocks, as these indicate a Scarak nest. …",

Of late, there seems to be quite a bit of talk about the future of the home PC and that it might end up going the way of the dodo, all because of something Jeff Bezos said. We have to go back in time to a little over a year ago, to when the founder of Amazon was interviewed by Andrew Ross Sorkin at the 2024 New York Times DealBook Summit . At one point, Bezos recalls a time when he was in Luxembourg, visiting a brewery. \"This trip was one of the little tiny catalysts for the founding of AWS (Amazon Web Services, founded 2002), and the brewery was 300 years old. This company [had been] making beer for 300 years … they had a museum, and in that museum was an electric power generator, 100 years old. \"When they wanted to improve the efficiency of their brewery with electricity, there was no power grid, so they had to build their own power station … they made their own electricity, and at that time, that's what everybody did if a hotel wanted electricity: they had their own electric generator.\" Why was he rambling on …",

Depending on when you're reading this, it might've done it already, given the patch launches on January 20. Alright, \"kneecap\" is harsh. Blizzard's made an effort through rounds of beta testing, and continual conversations with addon developers, to try and thread the needle between functionality and form. Basically, the developer doesn't want addons to be required—but anything that's cosmetic can stay . This means obvious things, like roleplay, map, and bag addons are all fine; It also means there's wiggle room in the combat addon sphere for presentation, which is nice for customisability, but it also means that certain accessibility features made by addon creators over the years can be maintained. Or so, Blizzard hopes. This also involves a lot of class redesign. Take my Outlaw Rogue's \"Roll the Bones\" ability, for example: Outlaw Rogues are an incredibly fast-paced class, but Roll the Bones saw you managing a set…",

We don't know if the strategy could have been replicated, but would it have been worse than the late Concord's legendary failure or the reaction to the recently announced Highguard, which was the final big reveal at last year's Game Awards ? Viewers expecting something like 2023's Monster Hunter Wilds reveal or the one-two Matrix Unreal Engine 5 tech demo and Matrix 4 trailer in 2021 have been taking out their frustrations on Highguard. The reveal was drowned out by hot takes calling out its \"Concord vibes\" and it received a ghastly 2,400 dislikes on YouTube compared to around 500 likes when it first dropped. There's been an assumption to some of the criticism that Highguard wanted this smoke, so to speak—an idea that if the Highguard studio hadn't splurged on such an exclusive spot, it wouldn't have earned all this ire.

That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history.

Designed for 1-8 players, Super Battle Golf sees you and your pals teeing off simultaneously, aiming to complete the course first by any means necessary. While you can theoretically try to win the game fairly, cheating is built into the experience. You can aim your shots directly at other players to knock them over, for example. Or you can run them down in a golf cart, shoot them with a gun, or blast them with a rocket launcher.

If you missed Legend of Grimrock when it launched in 2012, fret not, because both Legend of Grimrock and its sequel are 80% off on Steam this weekend. The original Legend of Grimrock is an unapologetic throwback, taking place within a twisting subterranean complex deep beneath a mountain and crawling with fantasy beasties. You create your own party, bust out of prison and seek to escape the complex, solving puzzles, avoiding traps, and battling foes in turn-based combat as you go. One of my favourite things about Legend of Grimrock is how tactile its dungeon is.

Back in August, Re-Logic revealed that it was \"in the endgame\" of development for the update, having defined an internal launch window that it confirmed with various partners. Re-Logic wanted update 1.4.5 to be a global launch concurrent across all platforms, which is partly what has held things up. Indeed, Re-Logic had hoped to release update 1.4.5 in December last year.

    "body": "No Rest for the Wicked might just look like a painterly take on Diablo, but it's actually a top-down soulslike —and a pretty good one at that, according to PC Gamer contributing writer Tyler Colp. It seems to be paying off, as developer Moon Studios announced Thursday that the game has moved one million copies on Steam in early access, though it is about to share at least one thing in common with Diablo: 4-player co-op . The co-op announcement comes with a lavish trailer showing the feature off, and states it will launch Jan. 22. I haven't tried the game myself yet in solo play or otherwise, but seeing a gaggle of heroes take on a huge boss together certainly makes it pop. The game's model for co-op, which was detailed in a lengthy explainer video from Moon Studios in Dec. 2025, is \"similar to how realms work in Minecraft, the only difference being you don't have to pay for a subscription.\" What that means is that rather than Dark Souls invasions, Diablo 4's quasi-MMO open world, or other ARPGs' multiplayer systems where a single player's save file is used, No Rest for the Wicked will distinguish between persistent multiplayer saves and offline single-player saves.

I think I just ate a compass. By that I mean a magnetic one, not a pointy one used to draw circles. I'm not stupid. I just can't see, you see, and when you can't see it's a lot harder to tell whether an object you just picked up might be edible. Hence, when I plucked a star-shaped object off a door and my inventory labelled it as \"food?\" as it does with everything, down it went, costing me two points of health and any chance of knowing where north is. Not that a compass would have been much use to me anyway, given the whole lack of vision thing. This would probably be the weirdest thing to happen in most games.

MMORPGs are monstrously complicated things—they run on huge, easily DDOSable servers, they have economies that can easily get knocked off the rails, are designed to run for decades, and require constant balancing and fine-tuning. If you work on an MMO, you are Sisyphus trying to get a boulder up a hill, except you also have a bunch of angry forum users calling you an idiot the whole way up. Part of my job is understanding these complicated machines, and as I look at games in 2026, I'm starting to notice a trend that's really come to a head in these past few years: The main existential threat to MMORPGs of the modern era is getting the dang difficulty right.

People still speculate on a possible XCOM 3 daily online, and the flood of imitators has only gotten bigger the longer the series has remained dormant. Personally I think I'll be waiting with baited breath all year to find out when I can get my hands on cheekily named spiritual successor Star Wars Zero Company .

To celebrate his reappearance, Epic is giving away the first two Styx games on Steam. From now until January 22 , both Styx: Master of Shadows and Styx: Shards of Darkness are free to keep on Epic. Both games are pretty good sneak-a-thons, worthy of respect simply for how seriously they take stealth. While Styx can technically fight enemies face to face, he is utterly terrible at it and will almost certainly get killed. Hence, evasion, trickery, and shanking guards in the back are the best ways to progress. Master of Shadows set the template for Cyanide, in which Styx embarks on a series of infiltration and assassination missions across extravagant fantasy locations.

The original version of Stellar Jockeys' shoot 'em up was a decent, if flawed affair. But the developer spent the next year overhauling the experience, delivering a new campaign and several other reworks that netted it a much more favourable Steam rating. The sequel, Brigador Killers, has been in development for ages, which surprised me as I assumed it was just Brigador on a larger scale. But Stellar Jockeys recently released some new footage of the game, which shows it is a very different affair from the original, almost like a mix of Syndicate and OG Grand Theft Auto. As it turns out, that isn't far off Stellar Jockeys' own summary of the experience, with the dev having previously described it as \"Hitman: Contracts meets GTA2\". The main difference is that Brigador was a dedicated mech shooter, whereas Brigador Killers lets players explore missions on foot.

Unfortunately, he's instantly lost control of his realm due to the invasion of robotic Terranoids that killed his father in the first instance. Naturally, Vvalek decides to take his frustration out on Earth, for reasons we'll presumably discover while playing. Like Size Five's previous game Lair of the Clockwork God , Earth Must Die is inspired primarily by the comedy point 'n' click adventure games of the '90s.

Brothers in Arms has been regularly updated since its release in 2021, with a new update reinstating even more missing dialogue from CD Projekt's cutting-room floor. These newly restored lines and cutscenes were highlighted by YouTuber xLetalis . The most notable is a new romance scene between Geralt and Yennefer that occurs during the quest The Last Wish.

Forbidden Solitaire wastes no time before getting weird. I was only a few minutes into playing the demo when I was offered some upgrades by an eyeball in a wall. It followed my cursor around as I hovered over gems that I thought would be slotted into rings on the giant hand in the middle of the screen. But when I bought one, my character jammed it right into his flesh. Forbidden Solitaire is solitaire if you could cheat by shoving gems into your hand because an eyeball told you to. My first upgrade let me undo my last move, which ended up being pivotal when I fought the fleshy mass of human skulls later on.

Or if you used Claude to generate a few code snippets? Or if someone in marketing used ChatGPT to make a spreadsheet?\" It seems that Valve has also been contemplating these questions and has made a tweak to its AI disclosure form for developers. In its submission form, Valve now specifies that game publishers must disclose pre-made generative AI assets only when used in marketing materials or content that \"ships with your game, and is consumed by players.\" That's via a screenshot of the form shared by Simon Carless' GameDiscoverCo. In other words, Steam's disclosure requirement is not concerned with generative AI tools used behind the scenes for efficiency gains (presumably including coding helpers) or office work, but with things like final art, sound, and writin…",

Hours of my youth were spent fascinated by the fact that there were people out there making Oakeshott Type XVIII longswords and copies of Gandalf's Glamdring. In other words, I was destined from a young age to be the kind of person who'd see that Bladesong, a fantasy swordsmithing simulator, is launching in early access on Steam next week, and immediately add it to PC Gamer's task tracking software with the addendum \"hell yes dude this is videogames.\" (Image credit: Mythwright) Bladesong promises an elaborate and intricate toolset for handcrafting your Platonic ideal of a cool sword—whether that's a period-accurate arming sword or a glowing, rune-etched work of high fantasy maximalism with appropriately absurd proportions.
