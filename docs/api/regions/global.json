The phone has a slick design and a well-rounded spec sheet, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip and triple 50MP rear cameras. The Signature also offers seven years of updates and access to exclusive experiences. We first heard about an apparent Motorola Signature phone last month. Fortunately, we didn’t have to wait long for the unveiling, as Motorola has just launched the device. The Motorola Signature is the first phone in the brand’s new Signature series, and it emphasizes a slick design and premium extras. Starting with the design, Moto says the phone is 6.99mm thick and has an aluminum frame. The Signature is available in Pantone Martini Olive with a twill-inspired finish, or Pantone Carbon with a linen-inspired finish. Motorola’s phone also packs Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection and IP68/69 ratings.",

But since I began my search thousands of miles away, I had to do all of my due diligence based on these photos alone. This is not a problem isolated to Facebook Marketplace either. AI-generated images and videos have quickly proliferated across all online platforms. Over the past month alone, I’ve seen several supposed leaked photos of upcoming movies like Avengers: Doomsday that were, in fact, AI-generated.",

It has said that it only delivers software after testing, refuting Google’s plan to split updates into crucial and optional updates. However, it has said that it will resume updates in January 2026. In 2019, Google set out to split Android updates into two parts, so it could deliver crucial features directly to users without needing manufacturers to first adapt them to their custom skins. These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section. It’s alright if you never bothered to check these…",

Don’t get me wrong, I can definitely see the progress I’ve made in my Spanish learning journey. I pick up on things when I hear Spanish, and I’m usually able to piece together what’s being said. However, contributing to the conversation is an entirely different beast. Duolingo sprinkles speaking exercises into its lessons, but the functionality feels more like a smaller piece of the puzzle rather than the focus. Speak , another language learning app that I’ve been watching from afar over the last few years, turns this strategy on its head, and the difference has been eye-opening to me. Speak first, sweat the details later",

The move targets long, forced ads and also bans delays when closing static ads. While ads fund creators on the platform, the regulation aims to rein in practices that many users feel are seriously hurting the viewing experience. It’s safe to say that unskippable ads on YouTube are only getting longer and becoming an extreme nuisance. Of course, you can always pay for YouTube Premium to eliminate ads or use alternatives like the Morphe app , but the truth is that those options aren’t for everyone. No one can really stop YouTube from running more ads on the platform or increasing the length of unskippable commercials, which currently go up to 30 seconds. However, one country is now fighting back, not with popular opinion, but actual laws.",

Both models support cutting-edge standards, including Dolby Vision Gaming, HDR10+, IMAX Enhanced, and Filmmaker Mode. They feature MediaTek’s MT9655 chip and run Google TV based on Android TV 14. Kickstarter launches in early February at $2,199 (Max) and $1,999 (Pro), with retail availability starting in April for $4,499 and $3,499, respectively. Projectors are fast emerging as a popular alternative to having a giant TV in the living room , and it makes sense, too. Instead of having a TV imposing and commanding attention all the time, a projector moves out of the way when the job is done. At CES 2026 , we’ve seen numerous new projectors from companies such as Samsung , Epson , and XGIMI . If you’re still on the hunt for a performance-oriented projector, the new Aetherion projector from AWOL Vision could be worth checking out. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This was a pocket-friendly phone with flagship performance and a big battery. Now, a prominent leaker has revealed apparent details for the OnePlus 15T. Leaker Digital Chat Station posted purported OnePlus 15T specs on Weibo. For one, the device is said to have a flat 6.3-inch 165Hz screen (1.5K resolution). This screen size would be roughly on par with the OnePlus 13T/13S while offering a higher refresh rate.",

DRAM and storage power everything from phones to fridges, but AI servers are buying it in bulk, leaving less for consumer devices. Samsung just issued a warning that’s hard to miss. The huge demand for memory chips — driven by AI data center buildouts — is squeezing supplies so tightly that prices across the electronics world are set to climb. At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Samsung’s global marketing head, Wonjin Lee, made it clear that shortages in memory supply are real, and they’re already nudging costs upward, Bloomberg reports. While the company doesn’t want to pass those costs straight to shoppers, Lee admitted that Samsung is starting to consider “repricing” its products to reflect the new economics.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Google has released the Android Security Bulletin for January 2026, addressing a critical Android vulnerability. The vulnerability can be used to trigger a zero-click attack on Android using an audio file. While the issue was fixed on Pixel devices last month, we’re still waiting for Google to fix other Pixel bugs, which should have been addressed in a separate Pixel Update for January. Google has freshly released the Android Security Bulletin for January 2026, listing a critical vulnerability that will be addressed in security updates. The list isn’t quite as long as the December 2025 bulletin , and that is because Google recently moved to publicly disclose a large chunk of security issues in Android on a quarterly basis rather than every month . In fact, the only critical vulnerability listed in the bulletin relates to the Dolby Digital Plus Codec , which is used for playing audio files on Android. As per Wiz , the vulnerability can allow hackers to manipulate the extra information, also known as evolution data, added to the audio file, which can force the player to crash on a broad range of devices. On Android specifically, it ca…",

It really has been this rebuilding time and this reconnecting time with my audience. It just felt like a really fun perspective to be in the middle of it, and for the party to be going — not to be like, ‘I’m going to sit back now in old age and reflect on the good old days.’ These are the good old days that I’m living right now.” “Electric Youth” peaked at…",

Since beginning the project, Google released the source code for nearly every new version of Android for mobile devices, typically doing so within days of rolling out the corresponding update to its own Pixel mobile devices.

Razer also showcased new AI-focused accessories at the event, including the Wolverine V3 BT controller designed for ultra-low-latency gaming on compatible LG TVs. Razer is no stranger to showing off cool concept ideas at trade shows like CES , including stuff like a high-tech facemask and a climate-controlled chair .

The company started strong with the OnePlus 13, 13R, and 13s, but then came along the OnePlus 15 and 15R , which left behind some of the highlights of their predecessors. While the new phones are only a few months old at this point, leaks have already begun to emerge for the successor to the OnePlus 15, and it appears the company could right some wrongs this year.

While it’s understandable to restrict video playback to prevent it from distracting users, there’s no reason it should restrict playback when the car is stationary or has its ignition turned off. Google, if it wanted, could place curbs on watching videos when it detects the car in motion. It already does that by preventing users from using the physical keyboard to search for a destination in Google Maps when the vehicle is in motion, and instead only allows using voice for search.",
