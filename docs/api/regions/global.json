    "body": "Credit: YouTube TL;DR Team of developers who kept Pebble watches afloat after the company’s shutdown now accuse the founder of “stealing” their work. While Rebble and Core Devices had initially agreed to work together, the former now claims to disagree over the terms. Rebble alleges that Pebble’s founder, Eric Migicovsky, could build a “walled garden,” restricting further open-source app development. After almost nine years of hiatus, the no-frills Pebble smartwatch is being revived . Pebble’s founder, Eric Migicovsky, shared an update earlier this month, revealing that 70% of the Pebble 2 Duo units have already been delivered, while the remaining orders are either in transit or scheduled to be shipped in the following days. In addition to this, Migicovsky has also relaunched the Pebble app store for early backers to enjoy new watch faces, apps, or games on their latest watches. While this is a positive development for Pebble fans eagerly waiting to relive nostalgia and cherish the same minimal smartwatch experience as the last decade, a newly emerged roadblock may stall Pebble’s recent progress. The new hindrance comes from Rebble, a community of developers who gave the classic P…",

Smart rings may be one of the trendiest fitness tracking form factors of the moment, but one company is making the case that health tracking belongs on your ear. Lumia today announced Lumia 2, a smart earring that tracks blood flow to your head in real time. According to the company, the device offers insight into energy, focus, and mental clarity. It’s a bold pitch for what Lumia calls the “world’s first smart earrings,” but it’s also one built on clinical roots rather than consumer fashion. Lumia originally developed its sensing tech alongside researchers at Johns Hopkins, Duke, and Harvard to help patients with chronic blood-flow disorders. Now, the company wants to make that same technology more accessible by packaging it inside a jewelry-like earring back it calls the Lumia Core.

Longtime viewers of the show likely noticed that when announcer Lou Wilson ran down the night&#8217;s guests, Samuel L. Jackson and comedian Ms. Pat, instead of ending with a shout-out to Cleto and the Cletones, Wilson debuted the house band&#8217;s subtly tweaked new name: The Cletones. The small, but significant change was another example of the huge hole left behind by Escobedo&#8217;s death on Nov. 11 due to the heart condition cariogenic shock. After a lifetime of friendship beginning when they were neighbors as children in the Las Vegas suburbs, Escobedo had been by Kimmel&#8217;s side during the entire run to date of his late night show, beginning in 2003. Fighting through tears, Kimmel paid loving tribute to his pal during last Tuesday&#8217;s show when he announced Escobedo&#8217;s passing, calling his 22-minute homage the &#8220;hardest&#8221; monologue he&#8217;s ever had to do. “We loved all the same things.

The filing reveals a maximum wired charging speed of 45W. The same website previously listed the Galaxy S26/S26 Pro with 25W wired speeds. Flagship Android phones typically enjoy the best features, but Samsung’s mid-range Galaxy A56 5G actually offered much faster charging speeds than the base Galaxy S25. Now, it looks like the upcoming Galaxy A57 5G might offer faster charging speeds than the Galaxy S26 . China’s 3C regulatory body has listed the apparent Galaxy A57 5G (model number SM-A5760), and this filing mentions a 45W charging speed. Check out the screenshot below, listing 10V/4.5A or 15V/3A charging support.",

But if you spend any amount of time around people who talk about digital minimalism, you start hearing the same familiar pitches. Switch to a dumb phone. Delete your apps. Turn everything grayscale. If you want to go a step further, lock your phone away. The advice always sounds great until you actually try living with it. For one, my job relies on technology and communication, and I can’t exactly turn off the dial on that. Moreover, most of us cannot simply retreat from the world. We need maps, banking, authentication , messaging, and the small conveniences that make everyday life function smoothly. That tension between wanting less and needing enough is where most of these experiments fall apart. At least they do for me. You either give up too much or you fall right back into the same cycle of tapping and scrolling without even knowing it.",

The camera also adds a variable aperture for better portrait effects and closer zoom. DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",

I’ve carried these in backpacks through busy days, in my pockets while traveling, and in my rental car while driving around. After all was said and done, I learned a few lessons from my experience, like the fact that the advertised battery capacity of a power bank is almost double what you really get when you charge your phone, and that the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL don’t like older Qi chargers . They also still charge really, really slowly over Qi2 and Qi2.2.",

    "body": "Brian Alpert’s path was always destined for the aerospace industry, but his journey turned toward NASA’s Johnson Space Center during his sophomore year in college. That was when Tricia Mack, who works in NASA’s Transportation Integration Office within the International Space Station Program, spoke to his aerospace seminar about planning spacewalks, training crews, and supporting operations from the Mission Control Center in Houston. Alpert was inspired to join the agency and later earned a spot as an engineering co-op student at Johnson. “My first stop after new employee orientation was Tricia’s office,” he said. Brian Alpert supports a spacewalk outside of the International Space Station from the Mission Control Center at Johnson Space Center in 2015.

The OnePlus 15R is expected to be a rebadged version of the Ace 6, which was launched in China last month. OnePlus is also teasing a new smartwatch, which may be a rebadged OPPO Watch. Last week, OnePlus unveiled its latest top-tier phone, the OnePlus 15 , but skipped a crucial element. Over the past few years, the company’s flagships have been accompanied by less premium but more value-for-money flagship killers, denoted by an “R” suffix. Naturally, we were also expecting the OnePlus 15R at the event last week. However, OnePlus made no mention of the phone, besides briefly stating it would be “coming soon.” Fortunately, the company has now begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, which is likely to raise our expectations for a launch soon. OnePlus’ sites for the UK and India have already begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, showcasing a silhouette of the upcoming phone. In the teaser, it can be seen in two colors: dark gray and metallic green. While the teaser doesn’t reveal much about the phone or its design, we catch glimpses of another recently launched OnePlus device — the OneP…",

The format remains high-stakes: no steals, no saves — just three head-to-head battles for a place in the Playoffs, plus one Mic Drop pick per team. The Mic Drop nominee performs at the Rose Parade, with the final decision left to viewer votes. This week, that honor went to Nichols, whose rugged tone on “Hurricane” by The Band of Heathens immediately grabbed Reba’s attention.

The new ad once again features Billy Bob Thornton and has a somewhat similar vibe to AT&amp;T’s earlier ad. The recent rivalry began when AT&amp;T released an ad accusing T-Mobile of “Un-Truths,” allegedly misusing NAD materials in the process, which led to requests for a takedown of the ad, which AT&amp;T is aiming ot fight in court. The battle between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile continues, as the latter has released a new ad poking fun at AT&amp;T. The ad aired on live TV over the weekend, though T-Mobile provided us a copy (above). Billy Bob Thornton is back once again, this time defending the Un-Carrier and what it says are unfounded claims about its performance. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

These messages are not official. If you get a message in Samsung Members threatening fees, do not reply or click any links in it. Samsung Members is an app that offers a grab-bag of functionality to Galaxy device users, from support and diagnostics to “exclusive perks” like device discounts. The app also allows users to message each other — and that feature is currently being abused by scammers. A post by user GaryB82 on the US Samsung Community forums details the message that’s been circulating. In the scam, an account posing as an official Samsung channel says that the recipient’s account urgently needs “verification,” directing the user to click a link and supply personal info. Failure to comply, the message says, comes with a fine. It might go without saying, but if you’ve seen received of these messages, do not click the link.",

Outside the window, the aircraft is being readied for a high-altitude mission supporting the Geological Earth Mapping Experiment (GEMx) , a multi-year NASA–U.S. Geological Survey campaign to map critical mineral resources across the Western United States. The GEMx team believes that undiscovered deposits of at least some of the 50 mineral commodities deemed essential to U.S. national security, to the tech industry, and to clean energy exist domestically, and modern mineral maps will support exploration by the private sector. In 2025 alone, the ER-2 flew 36 science missions, collecting more than seven billion measurements over 200 flight hours, contributing to the largest airborne surface mineralogy dataset ever gathered in a single NASA campaign. For this mission, pilots flew at approximately 65,000 feet altitude, requiring them to wear specially designed pressure suits to safely operate in the thin atmosphere.

A reference to “CINNAMON_BUN” was discovered within the code of the latest Android Canary release. The OS is currently using the placeholder API level 10000, but it will eventually graduate to API level 37. Development on Android 17 is well underway, but we still don’t know much about the next major OS update. While we have an inkling about some of its potential new features, we lack concrete evidence confirming they’ll be included. We’ve even heard through the grapevine that Android 17’s dessert codename is “ Cinnamon Bun ,” but without official confirmation, we couldn’t be sure. Fortunately, we’ve now found strong evidence confirming that “Cinnamon Bun” is indeed the internal moniker.

The app also unlocks accessibility settings, such as transparency mode customization and the ability to use your AirPods as hearing aids. The only caveat here is that you cannot use the features without rooting your phone. Apple has always used a pretext of privacy to keep its devices exclusive and limited to its ecosystem. The same issue occurs with AirPods, which, despite using Bluetooth as the medium, lack basic app controls when connected to a non-Apple device, resulting in a severely limited experience. Thankfully, there’s an app that addresses the limitations when AirPods are paired to Android devices . While apps, such as OpenPods , already let you leverage some of the features, this newer app takes it several notches higher.

This two-part annual release schedule could predictably cause a reactionary split in Android flagship launches, with more premium models launching in the fall, and budget and value options launching in the coming spring. Ever since the iPhone 4S was launched in 2011, Apple has typically introduced its main phone lineup in September or October. Android smartphone manufacturers previously prioritized a flagship launch at events like MWC. However, over the years, it seemed that the entire industry had been inching closer to releasing the best new Android phones closer to Apple’s latest iPhone. This year, it’s the closest Android flagship SoCs have launched next to Apple’s SoC, and consequently, new Android flagships have arrived closer to the iPhone 17 series . Just as Android OEMs were about to settle into this rhythm, Apple seems to be on its way to run at a different pace. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It’s easily one of my most used gadgets and the one that’s accompanied me through more flights I can count, weekend breaks, and long sleepless nights engrossed in the latest horror or thriller read. But even as a Kindle die-hard, the more I use it, the more I’ve realised that for all its strengths, it’s a device that is truly living in Amazon’s walled garden, and is essentially behind much of the competition. You can’t really change how it looks beyond the basics. While you can add fonts, they won’t work with every e-book format. You can’t stop ads without paying extra. You can’t even stop it from downloading updates. The Kindle is designed to be a fully gated experience, and over time, that’s started to bother me. Even more so once I discovered that there is a way to unlock the Kindle’s full capabilities and bring it on par with competitors like the Kobo lineup. All it takes is a jailbreak to unlock the Linux-based Kindle’s full functionality.",

Unfortunately, emulation and a shortage of time don’t really go hand in hand. I can never remember which device I played a game on last, meaning I might have one save on my phone and another on my laptop. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve not even had the correct ROM saved on my tablet. And then there are nights I’d prefer to play on the TV.

At launch, T-Mobile promised the consolidated experience would be an upgrade for customers, making it easier to manage services and perform account-level tasks without calling customer service or jumping through hoops. As we approach 2026, the question remains: Is T-Life really as bad as some think, or has it finally matured into something worth using?",

There have been some duds, though — a few Drops that didn’t bring much or were shockfull of features I didn’t really care for. Nothing, though, comes close to this latest November Pixel Drop . I’ve updated both my Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, as well as my older Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL, just to make sure I wasn’t missing something, and I couldn’t tell you how underwhelmed I felt when the update notice popped up and all I got was… the Wicked theme pack ?!",

    "body": "TL;DR As part of a settlement with Epic, Google is introducing support for “Registered App Stores” starting with Android 17. Certified third-party stores will utilize a “single store install screen” that automatically grants permission to install other apps. The agreement also prohibits device manufacturers from adding extra warning screens or barriers to block these store installations, prohibits Epic from bringing its Game Store to the Play Store, and ends the mudslinging between Epic and Google. Last week, Epic and Google proposed a settlement that would end their legal dispute over Android app distribution. As part of the settlement, Google committed to making major changes to the Android OS , the Play Store, and its communications and licensing agreements with developers and OEMs. One of the most significant changes involves introducing support for “Registered App Stores” in Android 17 . A “Registered App Store” is a third-party app store that Google has certified as a legitimate platform for downloading Android apps . Any store that receives this certification will be eligible to use Android’s new “single store install screen” for installation. This new screen will use “neut…",

We might be in for inflated smartphone prices in the near future. A report released today says that smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi and OPPO are feeling the squeeze as makers of RAM and storage for smartphones are allocating more manufacturing capacity to clients building data centers. This increased demand for memory components is resulting in higher costs for manufacturers — and you know what that means. As reported by Jiemian News (via @Jukanlosreve on Twitter), smartphone manufacturers including Xiaomi, OPPO, and Vivo have suspended purchasing memory from suppliers like Samsung and Micron as those suppliers have increased prices drastically in recent months. Jiemian reports that a representative for an unnamed Chinese smartphone manufacturer told the publication their firm is now facing the prospect of either lowering specifications on new devices or increasing prices for customers.",

Data reveals Gemini more than doubled its traffic share over the past year as ChatGPT’s market hold started to chip away. ChatGPT still represents over 70% of generative AI web traffic, although Gemini holds over 10% for the first time. OpenAI kicked off the AI race in late 2022 with the emergence of ChatGPT, the first mainstream chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs). Nearly three years later, the artificial intelligence landscape is ripe with competition. Companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Perplexity, Anthropic, and xAI are vying for users and market share as they challenge ChatGPT. Data shared by Similarweb on X this week revealed Google is steadily building momentum and stealing web traffic from OpenAI. As the chart below reveals, ChatGPT had a staggering 86.6% of generative AI traffic share one year ago. Traffic share is a metric used to compare website activity to industry peers. It’s a proportion that represents the percentage of visitors a grouping of competing sites each receive in a particular market. In this case, this chart looks …",

Rather than a standalone direct messaging system, group chats in ChatGPT are a way to collaborate with others within an AI chat.
