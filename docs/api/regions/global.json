This week I've been: continuing to play way too much Borderlands 4 while getting to grips with the endgame. By now, it's beating a dead horse saying that Penetrator Augment 'crit' throwing knives are overpowered in Borderlands 4 . Creative director Graeme Timmins has already agreed as much, noting the infamous knives \" will get addressed \", alongside some unintentional interactions and broken builds, very soon. For those living under a rock, the Penetrator Augment that can drop on throwing knives causes all damage dealt to the target to become guaranteed critical hits for a short duration. With almost any build, especially those specced into bonuses with critical hits or status effects like the bleed Vex build , this short window is more than long enough to burst down any boss in the blink of an eye. Plus, you can also get the Damage Amp Payload effect, which—in the same vein as Penetrator—causes the target to simply take increased damage for a duration. In fact, you can even get these two bonuses together if you're lucky for guaranteed critical hits and a flat increase in damage…",

Warning: spoilers ahead for the latest episode of Peacemaker! The emote comes from the second season's opening dance sequence, where John Cena's character stiffly flails his arms before following up with a cheeky little hip thrust. With no context it could be excused as a silly goofy routine, but Peacemaker's latest episode came with a huge revelation that all but confirms the meaning behind the move. It turns out the seemingly perfect alternate dimension Peacemaker has been hanging around in is actually one where America lost to Hitler in World War 2. Essentially, he's accidentally found himself in Nazi utopia, exclusively populated by white people and where the American flag's stars have been exchanged for a swastika.

The trailer starts with a bunch of celebrities: Zac Efron, Jimmy Butler, Morgan Wallen, and Paddy Pimblett gearing up for a fight, but sadly, they don't really get too far as they're blown to bits in just a couple of seconds. This is followed by an unknown soldier asking, \"Who was that?\" as another soldier replies, \"Doesn't matter, let's move.\" I was pretty relieved when I saw these celebrities get blown up. It's not like I've got anything against them, but seeing a Battlefield 6 trailer with guest stars didn't fit the vibe that I thought Battlefield Studios was going for with this latest game. One of the biggest fears many players have had throughout the lead-up to Battlefield 6 was that it would unceremoniously morph into Call of Duty at some point, be that by adding ridiculous skins or with weird collabs that are out of place in its gritty battleground. So blowing up Zac Efron and co may seem like a bit much, but it has worked wonders in quelling …",

The over-reliance on literal toilet humor in Borderlands 3 was so universally disliked that a follow-up was always going to pare it back a bit. Which Borderlands 3 does, though sometimes too much. The villains in particular end up feeling like personality-free zones, some of them not even having enough going on to fill the empty space on their introductory title cards. They're just names and hit points. The sidequests squeeze in some of the personality the main questline leaves out, and even (whisper it) reference the occasional meme. My favorite so far is Forgive Me, a quest based on a viral joke about the storytelling in Soulsborne games—a joke tweeted by Borderlands 4 head writer Sam Winkler back in 2022. (Image credit: Sam Winkler) Because the internet is the way it is, Winkler ended up having to explain in the replies that he actually likes FromSoftware games, saying, \"I am begging anyone who thinks I'm dunking on fromsoft to learn how to make fun of the things you love\".

If my memory serves me right, it was around 11 years ago that we first entered the PC market with Yakuza 0,\" recalled Yokoyama. \"Until then, we had only released our games on PlayStation, and they were exclusively in Japanese, made specifically for the Japanese market. \"The Yakuza series itself was originally created with the concept of 'Japanese people making a game for Japanese people,' so we never imagined it would be accepted globally. But once we properly localized the language and created an environment where players around the world could enjoy it, the PC market embraced it in a big way. That acceptance helped our studio grow and pushed us toward globalization.\" Yakuza 0 on PC was certainly my introduction to the series, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio finally bridged that gap with some of its finest work.

Both Hollow Knights are deliciously old school in how they make you work for your double jump, withholding it until deep into the game.

Tom's Hardware spotted numerous eBay listings for the Xbox Ally X priced as high as $2,500. For context, the MSRP is $999 for the Xbox Ally X or $599 for the base Xbox Ally. Both devices are set to launch on October 16. If you want to snag a Xbox Ally, it's best to avoid eBay entirely. At the time of writing, pre-orders are still open for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X at Best Buy , Asus , and Microsoft (if you're outside the US, you can check the official Xbox pre-order page to find pre-order options in your region). This is a pretty pricey handheld as it is, all things considered, so don't let a scalper trick you into paying double.

So, while things might get off to a rocky start, issues will get smoothed out as those ideas are refined. As reported by GamesRadar , in an interview with Edge Magazine, 2XKO director Shaun Rivera commented on Riot's hopes (and fears) for the game, stating, \"We're the type of team where we want to try stuff. Sometimes it's going to land and sometimes it's going to whiff, but we will be trying things. I want to set those expectations for players that something we try might go wrong or it might not be good, but we'll address it.\" Rivera also noted that \"it's going to be a little bumpy when we get out,\" although that's to be expected with any early access game.

Broken Lore: Don't Lie, a spin-off of the horror game Don't Watch, encapsulates that feeling and then some. It puts you in the shoes of Junko, an isolated young woman losing her grip on reality while in self-imposed isolation. Don't Lie was shown off for the first time during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, and the trailer gave me chills. Junko is a \"hikikomori,\" someone who secludes themself at home, away from the outside world. Following a therapeutic program, Junko finds herself alone again, desperately trying to reconnect with two of the people she met during the process. One is Shinji, the protagonist of Don't Watch. The game is all first-person, and you'll venture throughout Juno's apartment and her own, crumbling psyche which is conjuring up liminal spaces and terrifying hallucinations. The trailer shows off the mix of hyper realistic interiors like swimming pools and hallways covered in notes, as well as a scary, eye-covered monster inspired by the Dodomeki, a Japanese folklore spirit. There are so, so many eyes. To contrast the scares is a fully-playable versi…",

Part of that I attribute to its original fantasy world where it feels like the devs, unshackled by the aesthetic constraints of a 20-year-old series, were able to make something far more grandiose than grimy streetfights. Who better, then, to bang out the soundtrack than Yuka Kitamura, mastermind behind the tunes of Elden Ring and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice? A studio recording was revealed during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, interspersed with some new clips of the game's combat. It's all snarling strings and portentous vocal melodies, and given that it's performed by a live orchestra, it's a level of production value the sidescrolling beat 'em up is treated to less often than I'd like.

You'll meet Tea Practitioner Nami, a white cat called Taiko, and a disgruntled fisherman. The gang's all here. You play as a monk who can literally ride the wind, using the clouds as platforms to walk on or skimming across the water gracefully. Meeting a talking cat doesn't seem so farfetched now. We also see more of the poem-making in action. You'll get to craft haikus based on the environment around you. So, when you encounter the fisherman, you can try to cheer him up by choosing from a list of words you've gathered and making the best verse you can think of.

Of course, you don't play as the cult's true head honcho in Join Us; you're a franchise owner of sorts, building a personalized wing of a much larger doomsday cult in the rural United States. You'll build a remote compound, conceal yourself from local scrutiny, and recruit the psychologically vulnerable who you can detect with target-highlighting \"leader vision.\" It's like Batman's detective sight from the Arkham games, but for emotional manipulation. It's a 2-4 player open-world romp with tongue squarely in cheek, if you couldn't tell by the bespoke musical number in the preview. But the premise lends itself to more than mere novelty.

Visually, it's a board game where you place tiles on a grid.

Being an autobattler, once you've decked out your board with trinkets and abilities, all you can do is watch and hope it comes out on top. The catch is that the opponents you fight are board setups previous players had their souls \"trapped\" with, with asynchronous battles playing out similarly to Backpack Battles or Down With the Ship .

However, things take a sinister turn when the eyes get you to type \"Liars must be punished\" and \"I offer you my left eye.\" PSA: Don't offer the weird eyes in your computer your own peepers, that won't go well for you.

You can then replay that movement, allowing the protagonist to, in the first example, cross a large gap by first recording themselves walk the length of the gap on a flat surface. But that's not all this power is good for. If there's a wall that's too high to jump over but you went up an elevator nearby, just record your motion in there and you'll simply float above the obstacle. I'm sure there are a huge number of platforming puzzles that can be created with a clever system like this. If you're on a spinning platform you can record a circle, or if you do a series of jumps you can dart around obstacles in the air without a care in the world. It seems something like a more tactical version of Super Meat Boy or Celeste (perhaps with less ragequitting).

Farmbotic is a little like a 3D Stardew Valley, offering a cute, easy-going farming and gathering experience, complete with enemies to slay in mines and dungeons. The twist is that it also throws in co-op and some mechanical elements à la Satisfactory. As you can see in the trailer, there are cute robots that will work the land with you, and also machines you can build and pipes you can connect to help you keep up with all the labor that goes into maintaining a proper farm. It's also got a charming '70s and '90s retro-futuristic style, and gives the bots some sweet bunny ears. Another feature that's just been announced is that Farmbotic will be launching with crossplay, so you won't need to disown any friends who choose to get it on PS5 or Xbox.

Creative director Bryan Wynia kicks off the new gameplay trailer by introducing us to three new weapons that are being added. First up is the Streik Dual Defender Shotgun. This thing packs a serious punch, and we see it sending Zeds flying backwards, cutting them clean in half, or both—often both. If you're worried about only having two shots, don't be! This thing even has a quad barrel attachment, which reminds me of the shotgun in Bulletstorm. Next is the MKR-350 Assault Rifle, which looks awesome when you start modifying it and adding all the attachments. It appears to be a solid all-rounder: real bread and butter weaponry that should be useful just about anywhere. Finally, the M14 EBR MOD 0.

A new trailer for the hectic action platformer dropped at today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, and though the soundtrack sounds a little more metal-inspired than punk, it's got an anarchy gauge, destructible environments, and nine anthropomorphized feline cyberpunks speaking truth to power by chucking oversized weapons at it. It certainly looks the part to match the trailer's tagline: \"scratch, smash, survive.\" Plenty of action games are already out there huffing the graffiti fumes of cyberpunk aesthetics for their retro cool, but what interests me most about Clawpunk is its hero-based setup and card system.
