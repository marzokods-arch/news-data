Path of Exile 2 YouTuber and streamer XTheFarmerX stumbled into an incredible idea for a competition a few days ago: Call on the world's strongest players and have them fight one-on-one with a shark injected with the deadliest modifiers you can find. The endgame loop in Path of Exile 2 basically involves running maps and defeating bosses. Each map can have additional difficulty modifiers crafted onto it to increase the potential rewards. Some of those mods can be brutal, like bonus health to all monsters or full immunity to certain types of elemental damage. The point of the system is to pick and choose which mods your character can handle. But it also means you can create maps that are so nasty that even the best players can't survive. That's the idea with XTheFarmerX's Boss Bash Bonanza , except the only goal is to defeat the shark boss that has trillions of extra health and damage, and a t…",

A Slashdot story yesterday relayed an editor's experience when he noticed that, after uploading a photo from his phone's local storage to Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage, the privacy and permissions page noted an opt-out \"people section\" feature wherein \"OneDrive uses AI to recognize faces in your photos to help you find photos of friends and family.\" When he went to turn it off, a disclaimer stated: \"You can only turn off this setting three times a year.\" It doesn't sound great, but users are speculating about what might motivate the restriction.

After working on some RPGs at Squaresoft early in his career, Kimura satirized the genre by having you go around healing monsters with kindness instead of killing them. Fox's love for Moon helped convince Kimura to get it translated and released on Steam and Switch after two decades. (Image credit: tobyfox) Their friendship, I realized within a few minutes of talking with Kimura in Tokyo last month, also makes him careful to avoid piggybacking off of Undertale's popularity even if he'd have a good case for doing so. \"The most important thing for me when talking about Toby Fox in public is that I really like him, and because I really like him and respect him.

Obvious highlights include release windows for two DLCs—Temple of Stone before fall is over and a new sector due next summer—with lots more packed into the margins. Free updates promise to bring new difficulty settings and farming items, improved NPC AI, boats, a brewing system, plus exercise equipment that lets you convert your bench presses into energy. If only you spent less time being a nerd and more time hitting your protein. Perhaps most surprising is the hint at two crossovers, one of which is \"sure to sink its hook in you.\" Whether that's about Peter Pan or Sega Bass Fishing, it's worth noting that the ink may or may not even be dry on these licensing deals, as the devs confirmed in a video Q&A accompanying the blog post.

It's not just a great game—as PC Gamer staff writer Morgan Park put it in last week's review-in-progress , \"a bullseye where it matters most\"—it's also very popular, as evidenced by its recent eye-watering concurrent player count of over 747,000. That number comes from SteamDB , which shows Battlefield 6 jockeying with Dota 2 for second most-played game on Steam right now behind the platform's perennial #1, Counter-Strike 2. The number has been left to simmer for a bit as I write this on a Sunday morning, but sits proudly at around 600,000 active players regardless. With a bit more oomph as the game builds up steam, it might just overtake Baldur's Gate 3's historical peak of 875,000 simultaneous players, which would put it very close to the all-time top ten . Still, it's overtaken the likes of Marvel Rivals, Apex Legends, and notably, any Call of Duty game on the platform, so even if it plateaus from here it is a seismic release. The campaign might be a little dismal; PC Gamer news writer Lincoln Carpenter noted \"it's an achievement that the Battlefield 6 campaign finds a way to make its tan…",

As we edge closer to the May 26, 2026 launch date, excitement for a third trailer is growing, but with a far from orthodox road to release thus far—one that's included leaks, court cases and \"indefinite\" secure hospital sentences , to name but some of its twists and turns—is a third pre-launch outing a given at all?

At the end of this month developer Northplay is running a closed alpha playtest, and you can sign up to test its tyrannosaurs right now. In a Steam post , Northplay explained the closed alpha will comprise a \"small slice\" of Dinolords, though to my eye it looks like a sizeable slab of stegosaur steak. The closed alpha will let players get hands-on with a three-part tutorial, after which they'll be able to explore four distinct maps, two different game modes, and a \"'campaign' setup with cross-level progression.\" That's enough to give Fred Flintstone indigestion. All of this will let players experiment with Dinolords' core systems, which includes typical RTS mechanics like basebuilding and unit control, as well as the more ARPG-inspired combat.

Duke Nukem: Horror Castle takes the bubblegum-starved FPS titan and plonks him into an all-new episode, swapping out the original's sci-fi shenanigans for a spookier theme. Created by modder WilliamGee, Horror Castle is a sizeable affair. Its nine-level campaign sees Duke explore not one but several gothic fortresses, offering between 3-5 hours of additional FPS fun. It isn't just a level pack either. Horror Castle introduces 24 new enemies including wandering skeletons, vampire bats, and Nosferatu-like bloodsuckers, as well as four minibosses from D3D with the added bonus of being able to shrink them and stomp them to death. Horror Castle also equips Duke with four additional weapons. Duke can toss enormous spiders to attack enemies, then blast them with skeletal shrapnel using the Bone Crusher, a weapon reminiscent of the Ravager from Doom: The Dark Ages . And rather than replenishing health using medkits, Duke can boost his vitality by cracking open discarded skulls and feasting on the soft and squishy sponge w…",

Up until this week, 9 Kings only had eight kings available to play as, using their unique decks to construct your base and fend off enemy forces. Talk about an embarrassing oversight! If I were making a game called 9 Kings, I would ensure it had the requisite number of monarchs befitting its title from the start! Fortunately, as of its most recent update, 9 Kings finally lives up to its name. The final ruler to enter the fight is The King of Time, who Sad Socket describes as \"a multidimensional gentleman who travels through the ages in search of more kingdoms to conquer.\" Basically, he's evil Dr Who.

The good news is, there are indeed plans for a new ToeJam and Earl game. The bad news is, at this stage, they're little more than that. The update comes direct from ToeJam and Earl co-creator Greg Johnson, who took to Reddit recently for an AMA . The subject of a new game was eventually broached by user Arkeband, who asked whether there was anything Johnson could share about previous \"whispers\" of another entry. Johnson's response was brief, but candid. \"I can say that a new game is in the planning stage. We intend to make it happen,\" he replied. Unlike 2019's Back in the Groove, this game won't be developed by Johnson's company HumaNature Studios, though some contributors to that project will be involved. \"It's going to be developed by a third party, [with] design led by the infamous and talented producer of BitG, Nap,\" Johnson elaborated.

Salvatore dished on some of the unique challenges of writing stories that have to stay consistent with an ever evolving tabletop ruleset and world state. Salvatore has notably contributed to the Star Wars Expanded Universe (RIP), but is most famous for his novels set in the Forgotten Realms, a world shared with classic PC games including Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and most of the Gold Box RPGs. Like Realms creator Ed Greenwood's Elminster, Salvatore's characters have gotten cameos in Baldur's Gate. Heroic cleric Cadderly pops in to say hi near the end of Baldur's Gate 1, while Salvatore's signature Drow Ranger and memetic Best Swordsman Ever, Drizzt Do'Urden, can be befriended or fought in both Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. According to Salvatore, making sure the action in his books hews close enough to the D&D rules of the day has been one of the job's more challenging demands. \"That's been one of the toughest parts,\" said Salvatore. \"4th Edition D&D almost broke me, not because I didn't like 4th edition D&D.

Diablo YouTuber Rob2628 showcased the build—which was originally created by a Chinese player on Bilibili —in a recent video. Played optimally, the build can crush the hardest dungeons in the game and speed clear them in minutes. Anyone who has played necromancer before will know how impressive that is for what is normally the slowest class in the game. Technically, the build uses the basic skill Bone Splinters, but that's not the skill you'll be spamming every second. One of the legendary powers you can pick up causes Bone Spirit to launch a volley of Bone Splinters in all directions. You ignore Bone Spirit entirely and just use the skill to fire off hundreds of Bone Splinters.

Instead of playing as your normal gacha-rolled anime characters, you get to customize one of your own and wear outfits unlocked through crafting and the battle pass. You can hang out and emote with other players in an open area called the \"Wonderland Lobby\". In the next major patch, update 6.1, this place will be decorated with jack-o'-lanterns and candles, but I assume it'll change with every season. The main draw of the new mode is all the minigames you can play. There will be a whole Roblox-style catalogue of user-created games spanning several genres, including FPS, roguelike, management sim, and survival.

What magic there is inside little rectangles of digital cardboard I don't know, but studios seem to find them irresistible. But do you know what I find irresistible? Turning everything into quizzes! So here we are, with a test of how well you remember your videogame cards. With just one draw each, you'll need to tell us the game's title—and see if you can get all 20 right in just five minutes.

    "body": "For a very brief period before becoming PC Gamer's weekend newshound, I wrote a newsletter dedicated to rounding up the best Steam demos of any given week. By far and away the best demo I played during those days was for a little game called Sektori . If you haven't heard of Sektori, it's a geometric shoot 'em up in the vein of Housemarque's Resogun and Nex Machina , before they became all about ultra-hard third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros . There's good reason for the similarity. Sektori's creator, Kimmo Lahtinen, worked at Housemarque for 13 years, before departing to pursue his own projects, like a hack 'n' slash game called Barbarian, and a match-3 life sim called Day Repeat Day. Neither of these games made much impact, and I don't know whether they deserved to or not. But I believe Sektori does. Housemarque's lineage oozes from every glowing, spinning polygon. You control a little 3D arrow (known in-game as a 'ship') blasting shapes as they spawn all around a top-down arena. If you get touched by any shape or projectile, the game is instantly over. It sounds almost stupidly simple, but when I jumped into the demo this time last year it revealed its ge…",

Vietnam, in case you're not already aware from going there, geography lessons, or ambient exposure to dozens of war movies, is almost half covered by jungle, and was more than half-covered by jungle prior to the Vietnam War. And the thing about jungle is the density of foliage makes it hard to see much else, like the sky, or passing animals, or someone with a rifle trying to murder you. Getting killed outta nowhere is kinda how war rolls, especially from the First World War onward, but it doesn't make for an especially fun or balanced play experience. It's a dilemma that Expression Games has wrestled with for a while, as technical director Kieran D'Archambaud explained in the latest issue of PC Gamer : \"Particularly if you're new to the game, it can be very hard to understand where you're dying from.\" Expression's solution is to …",

But as we watch it slowly ascend to the great operating system repository in the sky, I've been thinking about its legacy. And really, I think the best thing you can say about Windows 10 (among many potential candidates) is that it righted a lot of the wrongs of Windows 8, and for that it should be celebrated. It's easy to forget what a misstep Windows 8 was. Built primarily around the principle that an OS interface should be a hybrid between a touchscreen system and regular ol' mouse and keyboard, it managed to somehow fail at both, resulting in a frustrating experience for desktop users and a halfway house for those trying to make use of its flat, coloured-tile, touchscreen-friendly interface.

As spotted by Gematsu (via PCGamesN ) a listing for Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2 briefly appeared on the website for the ESRB—the US' entertainment ratings body. The page, which has since been taken down, awarded Fireteam Elite 2 a \"Mature\" rating for \"Blood and Gore, Strong Language and Violence\" (sounds like an Aliens game!). The page also mentioned the sequel was being published by Daybreak Games Company (as opposed to Focus Entertainment, the original game's publisher) and that it's coming to PC as well as PS5 and Xboxes large and small. Since games only tend to get rated close to release, this would suggest that a surprise launch for Fireteam Elite 2 is imminent. Of course, the rating could be some weird mistake, but the info that was displayed on the page tracks with rumours surrounding a possible sequel, as well as statements previously made by both Cold Iron and Daybreak.

In a roundabout way, this was recently demonstrated by modder, YouTuber, and mapper Goonya's Animations , who took a map he was making for Half-Life 2 and somehow made it run in Half-Life 1's GoldSrc engine with minimal visual difference.

Lone Pine is an adventure game about exploring a national park with only your wits and a backpack you can fill with items that might then be combined with each other to solve puzzles. Oh, and a camera for taking photos of cryptids with. Lone Pine National Park contains several undocumented species and it's your job to document them. First you'll have to lure them out, which means learning a little about each one, and then solving a puzzle to get their attention. The photography minigame is surprisingly involved, with shutter speed and aperture to control as well as zoom. It's not complicated enough to be a faff, at least not in the demo I played at PAX Australia, but it makes \"photograph\" a pleasing addition to the short list of verbs Lone Pine gives you.

The Control spinoff shooter FBC: Firebreak stumbled badly at launch, putting up a peak concurrent player count on Steam of just under 2,000 on release day and quickly slumping to under 100 less than a month later.

EA is working on a fix, but that's not good enough for Battlefield boss Vince Zampella. In a reply to a spurned fan on X , Zampella gave the sort of recommendation that any reasonable PC gamer would give in this situation: \"Can you refund and buy on Steam?\" Surely yes, they can, but it's a little surprising to hear that from Mr. EA. \"I have yelled about EA App people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?\" he asked in a post higher in the thread. (Image credit: Vince Zampella via X) Is Vince asking us who he should be yelling at to fix this problem? Surely he'd know better than us, but maybe he's just trying to make it as clear as possible that he's miffed. At this point, everyone on this big blue marble knows how badly the EA App sucks.

There is no more perfect day-one demonstration of what Portal can do than this surprisingly good remake of Call of Duty 4 Shipment by game dev Matavatar , who had a working version of the map up a day before Battlefield 6 was even live (EA released the Portal editor a bit early). I played a few minutes of Matavatar's Shipment in a server someone had going and, yep, they pretty much nailed it. Because of how Portal works at the moment, the map itself was actually suspended in the air somewhere in the skybox of Operation Firestorm, which is giving early Portal creations a Halo Forge-y feel (which I mean in a complimentary way). It's kind of wild that EA is letting people not only host custom maps from the jump, but even earn XP from playing in them. That means right now, you can hop in a Shipment 24/7 playlist (which already exists) and enjoy a mode that Call of Duty players usually have to beg …",

Perhaps the most ever-present member of the Final Fantasy cast, these idealised chad chickens have been in the series since Final Fantasy 2, and are the true series icon. And now one enterprising player has proven that there is a chocobo god. Take a bow Saint Riot, a streamer who mainly focuses on FromSoftware games but has taken a break with the (excellent) remake of Final Fantasy Tactics, and dared to ask the big question: do chocobos believe in god? Well… do they? To briefly explain: one of the character stats in FFT is faith, which is a double-edged sword that measures a character's faith in the divine as a percentage. A higher faith stat means their magic attacks are more effective, but they also take more damage from magic. The important thing here though is that, if a character's Faith score hits 95 and stays there, that character will leave your party to go find god. One more thing. The Orator class can use an ability called Beast Tongue to take control of a monster (such as a chocobo) and use it in battle, and the creature will level up.

That's not me telling you that, it's Graeme Timmins, Gearbox bigwig and creative director on Borderlands 4. Okay, to be fair, Timmins wasn't quite as foreboding as that, but he did caution players against using this (or any other) dialogue skipping mod when they brought it to his attention. Not because he's precious about you hearing his game's lovely words, but because \"skipping dialog could lead to broken mission states that might not be recoverable.\" Turns out all that nattering is holding something up, and that something is important. While other games might have dialogue-skip functions with hardly a problem, the way BL4 works means that \"This request is way more involved and riskier that it appears on the surface with how dialog is integrated within our mission system\". In other words, not triggering some key bit of mission info in dialogue might leave you in mission limbo forevermore. \"Don…",

I wasn't kidding when I said I think most of them are in a queue. At time of writing, Battlefield community hotspots mostly consist of competitive queue-posting.

Well, at least in one respect, that is, this is being why simultaneous multithreading (SMT) was abandoned. In a recent interview with Chips and Cheese , Intel's lead x86 CPU architect Stephen Robinson tells interviewer George Cozma that \"SMT isn't necessarily as valuable\" once you add hybrid cores into the mix. Intel has been using hybrid cores—a mix of P-Cores for heavy workloads and E-Cores for lighter ones—for the past few years, ever since 12th Gen Alder Lake processors. Initially, these had multithreading. But the most recent Lunar Lake mobile and Alder Lake desktop chips—the first ones other than Meteor Lake to use the 'Core Ultra' nomenclature—ditched SMT altogether. This trend is continuing with upcoming Panther Lake processors: they won't have SMT. Robinson explains that…",
