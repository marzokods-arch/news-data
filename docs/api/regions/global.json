Baldur's Gate 3 had to deal with characters from Baldur's Gate 2 having canonical events happen to them between games, like Minsc and Boo being turned to stone or Viconia and Saarevok backsliding into evil, and now the cast of Baldur's Gate 3 are in the same boat. The latest Forgotten Realms supplements, Adventures in Faerûn and Heroes of Faerûn, move the timeline on from 1492—when BG3 happens—to 1501, and hint at the fates of its cast. Quotes from Karlach crop up throughout Adventures in Faerûn and she appears more than once in the art for both books alongside Astarion, Shadowheart, and Minsc. And in none of those illustrations is she a mind flayer or a pile of ash—two of the potential outcomes for her in Baldur's Gate 3. The best ending for Karlach is that she returns to Avernus with the Infernal Engine still burning away inside her chest…",

The trailer starts out looking like it could almost be a Witcher spinoff: The UI, music, voices, even the way the medieval city resembles Novigrad all smacked me in the face. Junior cadet vampire Coen has Geralt's signature messy high ponytail (but in brunette), and he also shares a name with a prominent book witcher absent from the games. The quest in question is a Witcher 3 monster hunt almost to a T: Coen talks to some \"cor blimey\" yokels⁠—with, I do have to say, delightfully craggy, varied, character actor-type faces⁠—who point him in the direction of monster-type happenings to earn access to a cathedral's library. Coen uses the exact same Witcher Senses as Geralt (down to the sepia filter and red outlines!) to uncover a feral vampire's lair, and the beast even cribs the Bruxa scream attack from Blood and Wine.

    "body": "American McGee's Alice is simply sensational , what with its weird, janky hybrid of shooter-inspired action and surreal 3D platforming, and though the sequel Madness Returns didn't hit me quite as hard, it's still well worth your time . The problem, for PC gamers at least, is that Madness Returns has a pretty rough port that's only gotten harder to work with since its release in 2011; until now, anyway. Modder Wemino has undertaken the noble task of brushing up the port themselves, and released the initial build of their custom MadnessPatch Friday. It's remarkably feature-rich for a fanmade patch: not only does it improve textures, force subtitles to scale correctly above 720p, and adjust the camera for ultrawide resolutions, it also addresses crashes, fixes up broken physics at high framerates, and helps the game run in windowed mode without it throwing a fit. In other words, it's hard to imagine going back to an unmodded build. You might know Wemino from their other excellent patches: EchoPatch for best-in-class horror FPS F.E.A.R. and VorpalFix for the original Alice game, which I used (with great results!) for a recent playthrough. All three are extensive iterations, and this …",

Metal Gear Solid really blew the doors down, but it's the 2D, 8-bit Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 for Japanese MSX computers where the series began. You can observe the beginnings of Hideo Kojima's signature style, particularly in Metal Gear 2, and these are the games that actually show Snake's battles with Big Boss⁠—as well as body double and MGS5 protagonist, Venom Snake⁠—that would reverberate for the rest of the series.

Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. In-game cosplay is something I've never even thought about but, now I've found it, makes complete sense and I'm shocked I haven't tried it before.

If you couldn't tell from all the things I've written about it, I love videogame music. Even before big-budget studios were employing whole-ass orchestras to perform grand symphonies, composers were making full use of synthesizers and sound chips to create pieces that would've had Beethoven telling all his pals \"Have you heard that One Winged Angel? It's pretty good.\" Videogame music is home to so many bangers that it would be a huge disservice if they were forever confined to the games they were created for, which is where the humble videogame concert comes in. It's a chance to hear your favourite tracks brought to life by an in-person orchestra, often complemented by visuals from the game and maybe even a guest appearance from the composer themselves. To my surprise, the first videogame concert happened far earlier than I ever anticipated—in August 1987 according to GameConcerts , where Dragon Quest composer Koichi Sugiyama presented the Fami…",

But in a year where Call of Duty hasn't been so challenged in arguably well over a decade, largely thanks to Battlefield 6 , it's the small changes that matter just as much as sweeping ones. That said, a co-op campaign, an SBMM-free playlist, more Mastery Camos , Hybrid Combat Specialities, and double jumps are a pretty good list of sizable changes, even if it's not a radical reinvention. That's cool and all, but I'm more hyped about Overclocks, one of the few major upgrades to scorestreaks since Modern Warfare 3 (the first one) introduced point streaks—and it's a callback to the maligned Advanced Warfare of all things.

In short, there's plenty of motivation for Facepunch to keep Garry's Mod fresh, and its latest patch livens up how it looks and functions in several ways. Primarily, the November update improves Garry's Mod's water visuals, introducing fluid rendering features from more recent Source engine games. As the update's Steam post notes. \"This includes flow maps, lightmaps, and [the] ability to reflect 3D skybox.\" However, Facepunch cautions that the changes \"may unexpectedly affect a small amount of existing maps\" due to some map creators already using modified water materials pulled from newer Source games. \"This is unfortunately unavoidable from our end and will need to be individually fixed by ma…",

Seems a lot of people can't resist the allure of playing with a cursed one-armed bandit in a dingy basement that's possibly also in hell. \"Thank you so much for all your incredible support! We still can't believe how the launch went,\" wrote Panik Arcade in a Steam post . \"We are truly in shock and deeply grateful to all of you who have supported us on this wild ride.\" There's more to the post than just gratitude, however. Alongside celebrating the sales milestone, Panik Arcade released a new update for CloverPit, one that primarily introduces a hard mode to the game. This mode unlocks once players win their first run with a rules-modifying memory card, giving you the option to play that run again while doubling the deadline amount, yielding a special reward if you succeed. Elsewhere, the update rebalances much of the experience, with Panik Arcade stating it has \"reworked loads of charms, values and other little details to make everything smoother and fairer\". For example, Panik Arcade has nerfed both cigarettes, which permanent…",

The graphics arms race is proving ever more costly for devs and players, with diminishing returns: The cutting edge Metal Gear Solid Delta left me feeling cold, especially compared to the similarly photorealistic, yet more vibrant, striking, and ten years older Phantom Pain. Meanwhile, people's champions like Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6 are scoring points with players by not just running on lower-end hardware, but looking and performing well . This isn't just a question of tech and optimization, according to Palalic.\"Good performance in a game isn't always a technical problem, it's as much of an art problem as well,\" he told me. \"A really strong art team can work within any shading and rendering limitations that are presented and lean into those.

Every other week, I'll be sharing my thoughts on the genre, interviewing fellow MMO-heads like me, taking a deep-dive into mechanics we've all taken for granted, and, occasionally, bringing in guest writers to talk about their MMO of choice. I think a lot about trends in MMOs. Probably because I'm being paid to do just that, but also because I think the trends are just plain interesting; we've had a golden age where everyone was trying to make an MMO , tectonic shifts in the kind of things players want to do , and ever-changing social dynamics that keep this aged genre vivid and interesting. One design shift I will never understand, however, is the bizarre affliction that struck MMO designers in the latter half of that 2010s-2020s golden age: The sudden and irrational belief that tab-targeting MMOs (or hotbar MMOs, depending on your accent) are old news, and that every MMO had to have some sort of action combat system in it. It's similar to the strange pall that swept over RPGs, where turn-based games were believed to be poor craft, even though these past few years have more tha…",

    "body": "\"When I first showed them the boost jump, are you kidding me? They almost threw me out of the room.\" Former Call of Duty director Glen Schofield is recalling the day he pitched Advanced Warfare's signature mechanic to Activision. As the series entered its second decade, it had already begun to veer away from historical drama and behind-the-headlines espionage. Treyarch was developing drone swarms for Black Ops 2, and Infinity Ward had dared to kick off the singleplayer campaign of Call of Duty: Ghosts in space. (Image credit: Activision) What Schofield was proposing, though, was something different: a futuristic moveset that would interfere with the fundamentals of CoD's sacred multiplayer component. Rather than merely providing novelty in the campaign, the boost jump would change the rules of competitive deathmatch, enabling players to reach high rooftops in newly vertiginous maps, and gain an edge through skilful combination of double jumps and mid-air dashes. If the idea backfired—drawing ire from a community which had grown used to its annualised fix of familiar FPS action—then Activision would be facing a serious threat to its most reliable cash cow. Nonetheless, Advanced War…",

In particular, the Polish studio was deeply concerned about competition from another game released that summer, Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham Knight . The concern didn't derive purely from the fact that Arkham Knight was a hotly anticipated game. CD Projekt was more specifically worried that Rocksteady's open-world superhero game would shunt The Witcher 3 off the shelves at retailers. Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski explained the situation as it stood in early 2015: \"There was a big question about the execution of the marketing, are we going to be, you know, on par with, with the biggest out there?\" he said. \"We had huge, huge discussions, especially with the retail in the US, but also UK, you know, the main markets, Germany and so on, because it was about convincing them that we can actually be allowed to spend money in those channels.\" Nowakowski explains that retailers have different windows duri…",

Bandai Namco has released an update aiming to address all these problems, while also adding a new mode that provides greater flexibility in play. Said new mode is called \"explorer mode\", which is a fancy way of saying \"easy mode\" as Bandai Namco explains in a recent Steam post: \"This mode significantly lowers the difficulty of combat and exploration, allowing you to better enjoy the story and world.\" This introduces some obvious adjustments, such as a more durable player character, increased dama…",

So while chatting with Dogubomb developer Tonda Ros this week, I naturally wanted to know what was coming next. With so many games being made into movies and TV shows, and since Blue Prince is so densely packed with stories and mysteries (some of which still haven't been fully uncovered yet ), I asked Ros if he'd been approached about a film adaptation. Might we see Blue Prince the movie someday? \"I have been approached, and I regret to tell the fans that it is not something I'm currently considering. To me, Blue Prince is this one game or this one piece of art in the medium of games. And so I couldn't really imagine it as anything else,\" Ros said. \"I'm a filmmaker myself. And before dabbling in game dev one of my dreams [was] to make a feature film. I have a lot of aspirations in that front, but I do think that each of my projects will be completely standalone.

The problem? Fish, apparently. I managed to play a little bit today without a ton of issues, but I wasn't the only one who experienced severe lag. Blizzard's been trying to figure out what's causing all the problems since the beta launched on Tuesday, and discovered yesterday that it might be some new fish technology that's bringing Azeroth to a crawl. \"We're still plugging away at this but we think we found a new problem,\" game producer Zorbrix wrote in a forum thread about the lag. \"FISH!\" They explained how there's new NPC behavior that's supposed to help creatures \"react to players and the environment in a more natural way\" instead of randomly wandering around and that it could be going haywire when too many players are nearby.

When Jung tries one more time to nail it down, saying, \"For you, you're the founder?\" Wales goes off. \"Can I just say again, it doesn't matter.

This year's paramilitary bacchanal, however, seems a more muted celebration: On Steam, Black Ops 7 is drawing Call of Duty's lowest launch day player count since the series made its return to the Valve storefront in 2022. According to SteamDB, which uses public data from the Steam API, there are 81,000 users playing Call of Duty on Steam at time of writing—well below the player counts of Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6, which are currently drawing around 370,000 and 236,000 simultaneous players, respectively. This does place Call of Duty in the top 10 of most-played games on Steam. But in comparison, when a similar amount of time had passed since Black Ops 6's midnight launch in 2024, Call of Duty was being played by almost 230,000 players on Steam. (Image credit: Activision) In other words, Black Ops 7 is generating roughly one third of the launch day interest on Steam that Call of Duty had mustered last year. Steam concurrent player count…",

A series of patches and U-turns have tried to soften the abrasive edges of the Portal's design—aimed at reducing the absurd power grind as well as making buildcrafting feel less restrictive and punishing. Still, these felt like temporary stopgaps—desperate attempts to staunch the bleed that didn't address the root issues at the heart of the new design. In a blog post last night, Bungie finally laid it all out: \"With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game.

Researchers in Japan believe they have cracked the problem, though, by developing a GPU-powered active noise cancellation system that's powerful enough to calm an entire room. That's according to NTT Laboratories , as reported by PC Watch . It claims to have developed the \"world's first spatial active noise control (spatial ANC) technology.\" Active noise cancellation (ANC) certainly isn't new, and many readers will probably own a gaming headset that sports the feature. What makes NTT's tech different is a combination of the speed of the sound processing and how it can be applied. Headphones with ANC use microphones to pick up nearby sounds, which are then sent to a small signal processor. This calculates the appropriate 'anti-phase' sounds to generate, which are then emitted via the speakers. The original noise and new sounds overlap and partly cancel each other out, greatly reducing the impact of the noise.…",
