Speaking of loops, I was deeply skeptical of the shift to a full open world, but now that I've properly got my teeth into it I'm a believer. Borderlands' cycle of 'shoot guys, get loot, sell loot, shoot more guys' pairs so devilishly well with this style collectible/objectives hunt that I'm shocked it took this long for Gearbox to make the shift. I keep getting distracted, vanishing down side-quest rabbit holes, saying 'just one more thing, and then I'll get back to the campaign' like Sisyphus planting his feet before shoving that boulde…",

According to TrendForce's investigations , \"nearline\" HDDs are \"facing severe supply shortages\", which is pushing cloud providers towards QLC SSDs. Nearline HDDs are ones used for infrequently accessed data, acting neither as cold (long-term) nor hot (rapidly accessible) storage but something in between. They're primarily used for data such as backups. The AI boom has meant there's more of this storage in demand than before, to keep previous AI training data and model roll-backs, for instance. One recent example of this increased demand comes from Western Digital. The company recently split from its SSD arm, Sandisk, to focus entirely on HDDs. TrendForce relays a notice from the company that was \"spotted by industry sources\" and explains that there is \"unprecedented demand for every capacity in our portfolio.\" Consequently, WD \"will be gradually implementing price increases on all HDD products, effective immediately.\" It will also expand its \"use of ocean freight\", which will increase transport time by a few weeks but \"significantly r…",

So, why not take this inherent strength and pair it with a massive 90% damage boost? That's exactly what you get with the Hot Slugger . There are well over 100 legendary gear items in Borderlands 4, and the Hot Slugger should be near the top of your list, no matter which character you're playing. It's powerful, sure, but you also spin it around like a cowboy when you reload it, and that's just cool. How to get the Hot Slugger in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get the Hot Slugger from Callous Harbinger of Annihilating Death, the final boss of the Craven's Nook Order bunker in the Bones of Sanctuary , to the east of Terminus Ridge. You'll need to progress the campaign until you can leave the Fadefields region, as not only is this area far away, but you also need to remove the armour on the door—just look over the ledge to the left of the door, and you'll find a bio canister that you can throw at it to unlock the bunker.

There's no time pressure, and you can't go bankrupt—if you ever run out of money you can just wait until it ticks back up again, and you even get a little car you can use to drive around asteroids picking up chunks of bonus cash to speed things along.

It's an impressive achievement for Gearbox's $70 co-op shooter, but if it puts Borderlands 4 somewhere in the stratosphere, then Hollow Knight: Silksong must be mingling with the aurora borealis, having hit 587,150 concurrent Steam players on the Saturday after it launched. Those numbers put Borderlands 4 at #46 on the list of all-time highest Steam concurrent peaks , just below Elden Ring Nightreign, and Silksong all the way up at #17, sandwiched between Apex Legends and Path of Exile 2. I don't like to fixate too much on Steam concurrents as a measure of popularity, as they don't tell the whole story, but they are one of few direct windows into what gamers are doing that we have, and this particular figure underlines just how colossal of a success Silksong has been.

I found one of the early weapon upgrades and kind of stuck with that for the next 30 hours. It got the job done, but it was nowhere close to the power of YouTuber Syrobe's \"easy mode\" build where you have an endless supply of powerful tools. Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it. You can pretty much equip any tools you want, but Syrobe recommends the Tacks, Silkshot, and the Voltvessels. He adds in the Pollip Pouch so every hit applies …",

As the dust settles, we're now getting our first estimates for just how many copies Silksong has sold. In its game discovery newsletter , games industry analyst firm GameDiscoverCo estimates based on available data that Hollow Knight: Silksong has already sold more than 3.2 million copies on Steam. Additionally, GameDiscoverCo reckons it's been downloaded approximately 1.5 million times through Xbox Game Pass, though it's unclear how many of those downloads were distributed between console and PC. For an indie release from a relatively small production team, that's a phenomenal success, particularly when compared with other Metroidvanias. Silksong's in a genre with no shortage of enthusiasts, but Metroidvanias aren't what we'd typically consider as having mass market appeal. Comparing Steam sales numbers against other games released this year with the Metroidvania tag, GamesDiscoverCo says \"Silksong's dominance is striking.\" U…",

    "body": "I'm making my way slowly to the end of Act One in Silksong, and one of my mainstays has been Thread Storm, a powerful AOE multihit ability that can be acquired fairly early on. But I've been a fool: despite using the attack in multiple boss fights, I actually haven't been getting as much damage out of it as I could've. Thanks to a PSA video from Jason Mondal on YouTube, I only just learned how to use Thread Storm to its full potential. Instead of pressing or holding right bumper on a controller once to activate the ability, you can rapidly mash the button to extend its duration without using more silk, giving you more damage per cast. The only downside is that this leaves you vulnerable to a counterattack for longer, but that's kind of the basic tradeoff of Thread Storm already. My preferred deployment is at a diagonal, up and slightly to the side of a boss to get them in the AOE while having a good chance of avoiding any attacks. Against enemies who can be staggered by Thread Storm, though, there's practically no disadvantage to using its max duration⁠—this ability can be a huge help during any of those tricky wave fights.

The entire build revolves around throwing knives that cause your normal damage to become critical damage. You can find the \"Penetrator Augment - Damage\" stat on any Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife in the game and it'll work regardless of the item's level. NickTew's character is level 50 and his level 35 knife works because the stat is the same no matter what. Vex has a passive skill called Bloodletter that gives your guns a chance to apply a bleed damage over time effect.

'Proper' office furniture can easily cost double that of the best gaming chair , and sometimes even more than that. Right here I have my bottom parked on a Humanscale Freedom Headrest task chair, and it's a serious grown up chair. And it's also $2000. I guess, in the sort of office where you've spent at least that much on your pink iMac and the same again on some beautifully engineered 'executive toy', that sort of outlay to support your spine and sooth your buttocks makes sense.

And, lo and behold, the stuttering was very much there—until I discovered a fix that's virtually eliminated the issue on my machine. It's not my own discovery, in fact, but that of YouTuber Ki11er Six , who posted a review of the game along with a crucial performance tip a few days ago. On Nvidia graphics cards, it's possible to manually adjust the shader cache size in the Control Panel—which Ki11er Six suggests should be set to 100 GB to prevent stuttering. (Image credit: Nvidia) To perform the fix yourself, first make sure the game isn't running. Then, simply right-click on your desktop, hit \"Show more options\" (depending on how you've got your Windows context menus set up), open the Nvidia Control Panel, and navigate in the side panel to \"Manage 3D settings.\" From there, scroll down in the Global Settings tab to Shader Cache Size, use the drop-down menu to select 100 GB, and hit Apply.

Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on. Bearing that in mind, Pitchford goes on to say that \"0.04% of customers [tickets] are PC performance related.\" The number gets smaller. Of that 0.04% o…",

The unfortunate thing is, the grapple is clunky. Whenever you use your grappling hook, your camera will immediately turn to face towards the grapple spot like it's switched on aimbot for an inanimate object. Although it's done in an effort to show you where you're headed, it's enough to give you whiplash while you're rushing around the arena. What if I told you that there's a way to fix it?

As a temp shopkeeper filling in for the local thaumaturge, I sit behind a desk and spend my rainy days puzzling over bizarre artifacts to determine what they are and what they do. A glass bottle containing a single glowing strand of hair suspended in blue liquid. An iron claw clutching black gemstone covered in blood-red streaks. Grotesque wooden figurines, several items that appear to be severed hands, a silver pendant with a green eyeball in the center that rolls to follow my every movement. What are these things? Fans of Bad Viking's first shopkeeping puzzle adventure, Strange Horticulture, will feel right at home in the gloomy yet cozy occult shop solving the little mysteries surrounding each artifact, dozens and dozens of them, over the course of about 12 hours.

Point being, a first gaming laptop is a momentous event, so can the Erazer Scout rise to the occasion? Well, the first major caveat to get out of the way is that this sub-brand of German consumer electronics company Medion (which itself is a member of the Lenovo group) does not currently sell outside of the UK and Europe. So, US-based readers looking longingly at that budget price tag are out of luck, I'm afraid. The second thing to bear in mind is that this gaming laptop contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 mobile GPU, an entry-level chip that, in desktop form, only promises performance comparable to the RTX 4060 , though you do get DLSS 4. Even without upscaling, this plucky little RTX 5050 gaming laptop still managed to squeeze out just a few more frames in gaming benchmarks than my actual rig , the iBuyPower RDY Y40 Valorant VCTA R003 desktop .

The studio's been spotted (by The GTA Base on X) counting its chickens before they've hatched in a recent job posting for a lead software engineer. \"With the continued growth of Grand Theft Auto Online and the upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto 6,\" Rockstar prognosticates that \"the successful candidate will lead both the evolution and operation of the data platform supporting what will be the largest game launch in history, ensuring it scales to deliver an exceptional experience for millions of players worldwide.\" Now, look, don't get me wrong. Predicting that GTA 6 will be the biggest videogame ever feels a little like predicting the Sun will rise in the east and set in the west, but I can't help but find it amusing that Rockstar is willing to talk about it like it's already established fact a full seven months out from the game's release.

Cutscenes were wonky as all get-out, with characters not appearing where they were supposed to (if at all), and sometimes sliding into or out of frame as if they were on rollerskates. Cutscene audio often crackled, making dialogue sound cheap and staticky. There were graphical problems too, with resolution options I would charitably call \"limited\" and water that turned black at a distance. It wasn't a great port, it was just a great enough game that I could overlook those and other flaws. There have been multiple attempts to improve Saints Row 2's PC port over the years, and the latest is the most impressive. Called Saints Row 2 Juiced, it fixes all the problems I mentioned in the previous paragraph and more.

This is our first actual scene from the season and not a little teaser, though, with Hemsworth sporting the white locks and leather armor of everyone's favorite mutant monster slayer. The clip shows Geralt, an elf, and a dwarf squaring off with a wraith in a dark forest. Dialogue-wise, we just get a little of that Witcher pre-fight monster explaining, the sort of thing Geralt would mutter while looking at clues, but Hemsworth hits the right notes with a similar growl to original Geralt actor Henry Cavill. The choreography of the fight is also physical and legible in a way I dig: Not so many cuts that you can't tell what the hell's going on, and some actually interesting flow to it. The fight's dominated by the specter knocking Geralt over and trying to drag him back to its crypt, before he jams his sword in the ground to slow it and then Aards his way to freedom. Rounding out some fun deployment of Witcher signs, Geralt lures the thing into a Yrden trap so he can actually harm it⁠, and finishes it off by tearing out its heart a…",

It peaked at over 30,000 concurrent players on Steam and even popped into the top 10 on the top sellers chart . In response to a successful launch weekend, developer Lizard Smoothie released a hotfix to address some early complaints players had, mainly around balancing and progression. Lizard Smoothie co-founder and CEO Eunsop Shim commented on the hotfix and hinted at future updates in a press release. \"Many fans have been with us since the release of our demo, and we want to continue to deliver an experience worthy of their passion and support,\" said Shim. \"Our team also has plans for more updates, improvements and new content in Shape of Dreams.

I left my previous Silksong skepticism in the bin pretty much the second I started playing, but it was stumbling across Sherma tapping his wee bell and singing to a gate to make it open that really sent me over the edge. Like Boc the Seamster in Elden Ring, a lovable, innocent, helpless character only becomes more striking and memorable in the midst of such a hostile, cruel world. I still haven't beaten Act one of Silksong, and I will not take it well if anything bad happens to my little buddy.

Mars Attacks! largely bombed, likely not helped by the fact that it launched in the same year as Independence Day. But it was fun and weird and probably gave a few people nightmares after it grafted Sarah Jessica Parker's head onto her dog's body. Fast forward three decades and Mars Attacks! doesn't have much of a legacy, despite its exceptional cast—Jack Nicholson, Glen Close, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Michael J Fox, to name but a few—and its cult status.

I've always thought of them as entirely separate stories, but Quake 2's latest official episodes—the Machine Games-developed Call of The Machine —explicitly connects the two, with the episode's primary antagonist summoning several Shamblers from the first game to attack the player. This overlap serves as the primary inspiration for Call of the Void , a fanmade Quake 2 episode that takes place after Call of The Machine. This episode throws together Quake 1 and 2's menagerie in much more literal fashion, splicing the roster of both games to create an army of monstrous hybrids. The episode consists of five \"huge\" new maps that mix \"new and old scenarios from both franchises\". Whether this means the maps are inspired by or directly based upon levels from the first two Quake games is unclear. What is clear, weirdly for a Quake game, is the plot.

Like DoubleBee's burrowing sim, Keep Digging sees players break ground using basic tools like spades and pickaxes, which they use to unearth valuable ores and treasures. These can be sold to purchase more advanced equipment like dynamite, wire rope, and batteries.

The game's music library is chock full of tracks, from original pieces to collaborations with other games like League of Legends and Tekken.
