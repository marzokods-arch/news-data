There's some more PR guff about how \"conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links\" and the exciting promise that \"soon you might see an ad and be able to directly ask the questions you need to make a purchase decision.\" Then we get to the first example of this brave new frontier for advertising and… it's a banner ad for hot sauce.

The Sims 4 Royalty and Legacy is all about creating family dynasties, earning prestige, and responding to scandals—this one is definitely for the Live Mode players. Seriously, stop me if you've read this one.

One of the three neighborhoods in the expansion's new world is also West African-inspired.

That's because, according to design lead Virgil Watkins in an interview with GamesRadar+ , they tried it during development and found that it made the game less fun. \"We're not building an auction house or anything like that. Currently, I think it's more leaning into the aspect of social facilitation in that sense of our design.\" Technically, it's possible to make money in Arc Raiders as a trader right now, but it's a slow, manual process to group up with customers, load into a match, drop items or blueprints on the ground, and sell those items later. An auction house would cut out the in-person interactions, but Watkins reckons that would undermine Arc Raiders' intentional emphasis on finding items yourself. \"We put a lot of very, very deliberate effort into making the game about the items,\" Watkins said. \"We previously explored and even partially built a trading system like [an auction house].

Other than the change in appearance and some new voice lines, investigating these cameo survivors works the exact same way as a standard investigation .

Now I'm playing Pathogenic , another game that pulls off the same trick. All these years later, one of EA's weirdest experiments seems to be occupying hearts and minds once more. Where Everything is Crab reimagines Spore's \"creature stage\", Pathogenic is (as you might have guessed from the name) a take on the \"cell stage\". It's not quite 1:1—rather than an early single-celled organism swimming through the primordial goop, you're a microscopic parasite invading a human body. But it embraces the same idea of evolution and customisation, to so far pretty impressive results. (Image credit: Aberrant Labs) The action plays out like a twin-stick shooter, my parasite's undulating \"secretors\" functioning as guns and my host's aggressive antibodies serving as the enemies. Combat is agreeably slick, in both senses of the word—piloting my tiny creature around is responsive and satisfying, but also has a swimmy, organi…",

The only award it hasn't been nominated for is Social Impact. It's clearly a big source of national pride for the French, though, as President Emmanuel Macron gave it a shoutout . The GDCA is voted on by video game developers, so you can be sure they know their stuff. Our own reviewer Justin Wagner wrote he'd \" never played an RPG quite like it ,\" but felt the combat's \"real-time half and the turn-based half feel at odds\" with each other. Love it or hate it, you've got to admit adding a parry mechanic to turn-based fights is pretty innovative. People also fell in love with the game's cast and characters.

In turn, Taiwan will boost its investment in the US tech industry, particularly when it comes to the production of silicon for AI. U.S. commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that this deal will see Taiwan putting $250 ‌billion towards not only AI or semiconductor production, but energy as well (via Reuters ). This figure includes $100 billion from chipmaker TSMC, which it already committed to investing last year as part of a long term plan to build new fabs in the US . Both TSMC and the Taiwanese government have also committed to investing more in the future, with the country committing to guarantee an additional $250 billion in credit. The hope is that all this money from Taiwan will encourage reciprocal investment in the country from the US. Vice Premier Cheng said, \"In this negotiation, we promoted two-way Taiwan–U.S. high-tech investment, hoping that in the future we can become close AI strategic partners.\" Reading between the lines of this optimistic statement, there's still plenty of uncertainty.

The tech in question is Google's Fast Pair system, which allows compatible devices to connect super quickly (i.e. one tap and you're done). As reported by Wired , researchers at KU Leuven University in Belgium analysed a range of different audio devices and discovered that the Bluetooth protocols used were vulnerable to being remotely hacked. Rather than just your phone being hooked up to your spangly new headphones, somebody else could join the connection, entirely undetected. Once in, they could do something as innocent as change volume levels or, far more worryingly, listen to what the microphones are picking up. Worse still, if the device supports Google's Find Hub tracking network feature, the location could be monitored. As with all such vulnerabilities, there isn't just one hack, but a collection of techniques that can be …",

We often hear how many total quests are in a game— Skyrim has 273—but how much variety is there really? Fallout co-creator Tim Cain explains the nine core types of missions you can be given, and, to my surprise, kill and murder are two separate categories. If you just want to know the nine kinds of quest, then here they are: murder, kill, the infamous fetch quest, collect, delivery, the often maligned escort quest, talk, puzzle, and timed. Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains. We all know what a fetch quest is—go here, get this item. A collect quest is different in the same way a kill quest is—gather a set amount of an item, like 20 nirnroot. A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person. An escort quest is similar, only you need to deliver a person instead of an item, so they're often trickier. All of The Last of Us can be considered one long escort quest. One that sounds obviou…",

And if SK Hynix's developments with PLC chips come to fruition, we could see a return to sensible SSD prices. PLC or Penta-Level Cell flash chips aren't a new thing, as Intel, Toshiba, and SK Hynix all started working on their development a little over six years ago. Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable. Flash memory cells work by using a large voltage to effectively ram electric charge across an insulated gap. Once there, it can remain stored for very long periods of time before requiring a top-up. Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information. That only requires the voltage sensors with the flash chips to read one voltage, which is very quick and simple to do. However, because it's …",

Items are horribly balanced, and online matches are rife with players sandbagging and hoarding all the good items until the final stretch—that is, if you can even get to that point before the game throws an error at you and boots you back to the lobby. For a game that feels so heavily centred around its online competitive scene, it should be a dealbreaker. But Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hoists itself up with some of the cleanest, most robust kart racing I've seen on PC, tracks that leave a ton of room for experimentation and optimisation, vehicle customisation I could only dream of in other mascot-centric kart racers, and an abundance of unserious trash talk that feels so on-brand for the Sonic cast (Big: \"You look tense, buddy.

However, the meteoric rise in the demand for AI chips, backed by hundreds of billions of dollars, would appear to have pushed Apple aside in favour of Nvidia, according to a new report. This is what is being claimed by Tim Culpan , a technology reporter based in Taiwan. With years of experience at Bloomberg behind him, he is as good a source as you're going to get, unless any of the aforementioned parties decide to spill the beans directly. It certainly makes sense, though, because while the phone market is dominated by Apple , and is currently enjoying a marked rise in market share, the number of wafers it requires from TSMC will surely be less than what Nvidia is asking for. You only have to compare the physical size of their chips to realise this. Apple's latest A19 processor, as used in the iPhone 17, is manufactured via TSMC's N3P process node. It has a die area of around 100 square millimetres, which means a standard 300 mm wafer can yield many hundreds of dies. At the moment, Nvidia uses TSMC's N4 node for its current produc…",

With the latest update, tables have joined the feature set, which feels useful, along with AI text streaming, which feels decidedly less useful. As I use Notepad daily, I was already aware of the new additions, but it's thanks to Windows Latest that I know everyone using Windows 11 should see them, too. Well, perhaps not the AI text streaming, because that's apparently still only for Copilot+ PCs (ones with a CPU that has a 40+ TOPS NPU in them), though Microsoft says it will eventually roll it out to all Windows 11 systems. The table function is blessedly simple in form and function, and if you're already familiar with tables in Microsoft Word, you'll have no problems using this one. You start by clicking on the icon in the menu bar, then dragging out the initial table you want to use. Adding or removing elements can be done through the same button, but it's easier to just right-click and edit everything from there. If you're a Notepad purist, yo…",

So it's not at all surprising that the biggest new feature of Yakuza Kiwami 3's Dark Ties expansion is a roguelite mode that lets you beat up hordes of thugs copy-pasted from the streets of Kamurochō. Even so, there's something cleverly meta in building an entirely new and compulsively replayable randomized mode out of spare parts. It's almost a flex on games that do just one thing. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth contained within itself a whole Pokémon subsystem and Animal Crossing-style island building as mere side activities; why shouldn't Dark Ties tempt you to spend 20 hours doing runs to level up sidekicks, unlock new weapons, and earn stat-boosting gear like you would in any other roguelite?

Released in 1998 and 1999, neither has been re-released in any sort of arcade collection or made available digitally until now, via in-game emulation in Yakuza 3 Kiwami. Both are delightful. Magical Truck Adventure is classic Sega arcade stuff: bright and bubbly and immediately throwing all sorts of stuff at the screen within seconds. You take control of one of two kids operating an old-fashioned train handcar, chasing down a pair of crooks who've stolen your magical jewel and decided to flee by rail, making them incredibly easy to catch. At least if you're in good shape: the physical arcade machine requires you to constantly pump the handcar's lever to maintain speed, while a pair of pedals allow you to lean left or right off the rails and jump over the barrels and other random obstacles they hurl your way.

In other words, expect to do a lot of creeping around in the shadows, a lot of urgent crafting in corners, and every bullet expended will count. Leon's parts will predictably channel the \"thrilling tension\" of Resident Evil 4, as well as its action focus. If you've ever wanted to deliver a roundhouse kick to a shambling zombie nurse, have I got good news for you. \"Each part is ordered to offer the ultimate balance of tension and release,\" Nakanishi explained.

It's not a metroidvania this time, but rather a single-screen platformer mixing simple Astalon-style combat with puzzles. I played the demo last year and goddamn does this game feel good . While the puzzles generally boil down to \"grab key, reach exit\", the final game promises over 50 levels, so who knows where the team will take it.

Comments on YouTube accusing the trailer of being made with generative AI began flowing almost immediately after it was posted. Some called out specific characters who look AI generated; quite a few others made the point that SNK is backed by serious money now and shouldn't be looking to cut corners with gen AI.

Here's the full photo: (Image credit: Amazon) Overall, the reveal seems to have gone better than Netflix's 2018 reveal of Henry Cavill as Geralt . Cavill's makeup and costuming ended up looking respectable in the show, but it was hard to tell that was going to be the case from our first look—that wig sure looked wiggy. In contrast, Turner's Lara seems to be fairly uncontroversial; not everyone's favorite take on the character, but there's no big upset over it.

Depending on your point of view, Bungie's Marathon reboot might have the most generous or restrictive free loadout of the bunch. As detailed in a new vidoc showing off all of Marathon's runner shells (essentially hero characters), Bungie says Rook is a unique class option that functions like a free loadout. You can't bring anything in with you, but you're supplied with basic kit for free and can keep whatever you find on a raid. That's more-or-less how the free loadout works in Arc Raiders, the most popular extraction shooter of the moment, but Bungie's implementation is different in two major ways: Rook players will always enter a match late, making it harder to compete for the best loot on the map Rook players can only queue solo Depending on where you land on Arc Raiders' free loadout debate , that could be fantastic news.

Thankfully, this 'flash bang' file explorer bug should now be no more, thanks to a fix contained in the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 28020.1371 which has already begun rolling out via the Canary Channel. The update, displaying the typical art of understatement usually deployed in patch notes, describes the fix as addressing \"an issue causing File Explorer to show a white flash when navigating between pages for some Insiders after the previous flight.\" On the one hand, I'm personally not loving how often being a Windows Insider feels a bit like being an unpaid QA tester for Microsoft. On the other, last year did se…",

    "body": "World of Warcraft 's Mythic+ isn't exactly easy to get into. Part of the problem is that… well, you're playing World of Warcraft, and as much as I'd like to speak kindly about the population of one of my favourite MMORPGs, let's be real, if you jump into public groups you're starting a countdown timer until someone starts rifling through their books of expletives to describe what they did to one of your familial relations. One of the hurdles lies in dungeon \"routing\". Because Mythic+ dungeons are all on a timer, and because WoW's dungeons tend to be a little more open-plan than something you'd get in, say, Final Fantasy 14, every single dungeon has a bespoke route filled with little tricks. And because this is Mythic+, you are expected to know them immediately, lest you be deemed a n00b, or something far ruder, which I won't publish on this website. Well, Blizzard's tinkering with a solution. On the Midnight beta test servers, the studio's introduced a new \"affix\"—basically a modifier—to Mythic+ levels 2-5. Per this post on the game's forums by a dev, \"While Lindormi’s Guidance is active, certain non-boss enemies will be afflicted with Temporal Sands, visually highlighting them an…",

Given an unlimited supply of people, how many dudes would you have to throw at the gorilla before it went down? 50? 100? Would the dudes and the gorillas be better served by turning against the masters that placed them in this arena in the first place? Those are some of the thoughts propelling How Many Dudes? a so-called \"dudebuilder\" roguelike where you amass an army of guys to pummel animals of varying quantities and sizes (and occasionally toddlers, I don't like to think about the toddlers). Really though, it's an auto-battler, and it's honestly a solid bit of fun. Here's how it works: At the end of each round, you get to either post a flyer to start recruiting a certain dude type (thus defining your build), recruit a dude, or get one of three relics. If you've played any roguelike ever, you get how the relics work—they're stacking buffs that you need to synergise with your build, yadda yadda. The real tug of war is in the knockout system.

QPAD has been around for a long time, and back in the day it was somewhat of a leader in gaming peripheral tech. In the early 2000s, I recall its mice and keyboards being recommended pretty often on various forums. QPAD didn't give me my first ever mechanical keyboard—that honour goes to the original Razer BlackWidow—but it gave me my second, becoming one of my favourite upgrades I've had over all my years PC gaming. Back then, the QPAD MK-50 was one of a handful of great value mechanical gaming keyboards in what was then a pretty niche market. That keyboard lasted me years, and offered simple quality for a great price. Then the company all but disappeared, (in the UK at least, where I'm based). But now it's back, with a new stack of products in the UK and hopefully elsewhere as QPAD looks to expand globally again. These products include the keyboard I'm happily typing away on right now, the Hall effect-boasting Flux 65 Model 5. I'm glad to see the company hasn't lost its knack for making quality, no-nonsense peripherals that go some …",
