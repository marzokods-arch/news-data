In the meantime, I wanted to share some of the technologies from this year’s reject pile, as a window into our decision-making process.&nbsp; These four technologies won’t be on our 2026 list of breakthroughs, but all were closely considered, and we think they’re worth knowing about.&nbsp; Male contraceptives &nbsp; There are several new treatments in the pipeline for men who are sexually active and wish to prevent pregnancy—potentially providing them with an alternative to condoms or vasectomies.&nbsp;…",
