It bundles together the first four Mortal Kombat games, including the WaveNet version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 previously thought lost, as well as less fondly remembered spin-offs like Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero for the sake of completeness and the memes. It also comes with an interactive documentary about the history of the gory fighting series, à la The Making of Karateka . Sounds like the complete package. Yet, within days of release, 55% of its Steam reviews are negative . \"Input lag is unacceptably high in every game—even offline\" says one, with some players complaining it's even noticeable in the menus. Others are upset that \"the online's in a terrible state. Quick play matches with random people only. You can't queue for more than one game at a time, so the community's splintered between games.\" Another laments, \"The 360/PS3 MK Kollection that came out over 10+ years ago had better netcode than this\". It's not just the lag and online that players are complaining about either, with the AI coming in for a drubbing as well: \"Since half of the match is just the enemy social distancing and staying 6 feet …",

Considering it's on consoles and other storefronts too, Embark might be dealing with a bigger server load than it anticipated. Players are having trouble finding matches and are getting stuck in queue times ranging from 5 to 10 minutes before they're let back in. The subreddit is filling up with posts from players encountering errors and I can see several Twitch streamers waiting to connect. You can actually see a fairly sharp decline in players on SteamDB just after the game hit another all-time high at 337,834 players. It's currently sitting at around 286,000 players an hour after the spike. Plenty of people still seem to be able to play the game judging from the player numbers and ongoing streams, but there's enough commotion that the official Discord server has put a 15-minute timer on how often you can post in the main chat channel.

It wasn't that you were crouched in the middle of nowhere with absolutely zero cover. Definitely not. If you play enough competitive shooters, you'll learn pretty quickly about the tricks graphics settings can play on you. Arc Raiders is the newest shooter with a foliage problem and you might not realize it's holding you back—especially if you're a sweaty PvPer. Knee-high bushes and other shrubbery can be toggled on or off through the foliage graphics setting, and you probably want it on \"low\". YouTuber staycation provides a good example of the difference with some bushes around a car. With the \"epic\" setting, the bushes obscure some of the ground around the edges of the car, which could make it hard to see someone at a distance.

Now, at last, the ultimate reward: an all-out fight against one final boss complete with an epic song that usually encapsulates your hours of hard work and your character's growth into some freakishly powerful being. For me, most of my exposure to boss themes growing up came through the endless stream of JRPGs I played. Final Fantasy 7's One Winged Angel will be the one that springs to mind for a lot of people, but I'm an absolute sucker for Final Fantasy 6's Dancing Mad—a whopping 18-minute, four-movement symphony that plays when facing off against Kefka Palazzo. (Image credit: Eidos Montreal) I'll also forever adore the final battle in Kingdom Hearts 2, where Yoko Shimomura takes a far more stripped-back approach with gentle piano and vocals that almost feel like the antithesis of a big boss battle—eerily calm and unsettling all at once.

Alright, let me roll up my sleeves and deliver unto you some lore . Not just any lore: mod lore . Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently. World of Warcraft has historically embraced AddOn creators with open arms, giving a ton of the game's information to them in-client through its API. Crack open the shell of any WoW raider's client and you'll find a homebrew moonshine concoction of custom raid frames, sound effects, and WeakAuras telling them what buttons to push and when.

Egg (subtitled 'Why not be an egg'?) is the new game from VVVVVV and Super Hexagon creator Terry Cavanagh. Available on Itch, it's a lo-fi, 3D puzzle platformer where you must guide a box of half-a-dozen eggs across a vertiginous, grassy cliffside searching for a lovely nest to, well, nestle in. The eggs navigate across the landscape by jumping. The longer you hold down the spacebar, the farther your chosen ovum will jump. If an egg falls off a platform, it breaks,…",

    "body": "I practically heard the monkey's paw curling a finger when Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow was revealed back in June . Here after more than a decade, was an honest-to-god new Thief game, one that brings back Stephen Russell to lend his gravelly tones to Garrett. \"But you don't get to play as him\", the antique shop owner cackled as he handed over the blackjack. \"And by the way, it's a VR game , mwa-ha-ha-haaa!\" As Fraser Brown explained shortly after the reveal , it felt like being slapped in the face, especially when the Thief community has so brilliantly carried the torch (insofar as a Thief fan would ever carry a torch) in the form of unofficial campaigns like The Black Parade . Yet having watched the most recent trailer for the game, which accompanied an announcement for Legacy of Shadow's release date, I wonder whether I was a bit too quick to judge. The trailer shows new protagonist Magpie breaking into a house in New Quarter to retrieve a valuable mask. The moment-to-moment play looks more promising than the brief snippets shown in the original trailer. VR's inherent tactility seems smartly deployed in how it lets you clamber up walls, drag knocked-out enemies around, pick up loo…",

    "body": "Remedy Entertainment's woes continue with FBC: Firebreak . The cooperative shooter proved a disappointment when it released in June, launching in an anaemic state, lacking basic features like in-game voice chat and a tutorial, and generally seeming like a compromised vision despite a few novel ideas. Its first major update, Breakpoint, went some way to addressing these issues , but failed to provide the bump in players Remedy hoped for. Indeed, at the time of writing, just 25 people were playing FBC: Firebreak according to SteamDB . The actual count is likely higher given Firebreak's availability on consoles and Game Pass, but probably not by much. In early October, Remedy issued a profit warning for 2025 due to Firebreak's underperformance. Less than two weeks later, Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, stepped down with immediate effect. Now, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz , Remedy has issued its financial results for Q3 2025, posting a 32% decline in revenue versus Q3 2024, and an operating loss of €16.4 million. Unsurprisingly, Firebreak is the chief culprit, with Remedy recognising a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million due to the shooter's poor performance. Speaking in the report, …",

Vampires to their coffins, zombies to their graves, and humans as far away from here as they can get. The trick is that your tracks can't pass over each other, there's only room for one passenger per car, and there are fixed entrances and exits to each tiny area. The land of \"Trainsylvania\" has over 200 levels for you to figure out, with exactly the kind of thoughtful design you'd expect from Draknek. Which is to say that each area starts off fairly simple, with levels introducing new concepts and ways to use puzzle elements before delivering excellent brain-burning problems to solve with just the same materials you'd found so easily a few levels before.

While explaining that the developers at CD Projekt Red did ask for advice and extra details about the setting while working on the previous games, these days apparently \"it's so rare\" that CDPR contact him to ask about the lore. Which makes sense, given how much the studio has added to it over the course of the Witcher games, like building Witcher schools based on an off-hand reference he threw in before regretting it . The other thing Sapkowski had to say about his relationship with CDPR is that, \"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now.

Responding to an article by IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine about the videogame Love and Deepspace's failure to account for nonwhite characters when lighting scenes, Zelle highlighted how Volition handled that challenge in Saints Row: The Third, Skinballs. Skinballs was made up of four spheres, each textured in a different flesh tone and used by artists to ensure scenes were properly lit for characters of all potential skin colors. Borman, the director of digital preservation at the Strong, expressed his own appreciation for Skinballs , and noted that it's become a bit of a memetic delight in various mod communities, sort of like that purple checkerboard missing texture pattern you see in Source engine games. This prompted Zelle and Salvatore to realize and celebrate that Skinballs is now part of a museum collection. The Strong preserves and showcases…",

Each time you build up a new kingdom you'll kick off with a choice of hero, like knight or priestess, as the core of your autobattling army. During the first days you'll build up a base of resources, like stone and wood, before using them to expand your production chains into the big stuff: meals. Every hero has a favorite meal to eat that lets them level up faster, a key to staying ahead of ever-escalating enemy forces.

The scale makes sense for its intended purpose, and it even has fun-size versions of distinct map features like the high path on one side of the canyon, and the protected cave route on the other. The bases themselves are small fortifications with a jump pad in the center, and usually see weapon and ammo spawns depending on what wave you've reached. It's frantic, claustrophobic, and fun.

This doesn't mean included games will receive any fancy overhauls or resolution boosts—quite the opposite. GOG's pledge is to preserve the look and feel of the original experience, while ensuring the games boot without any intervention from you. GOG launched the program just under a year ago, with 100 games such as Dungeon Keeper , Theme Hospital and Blade Runner receiving the badge of +1 compatibility. As of now, that number has increased to 250. The latest batch of entries includes some big names like Splinter Cell , Resident Evil: HD Remaster (which has been preserved in digital amber a year after GOG convinced Capcom's bewildered execs to add the original version ) and Hitman: Codename 47, as well as forgotten gems like Clive Barker's Undying . There's also a few genuine oddities on the list, like Legend Entertainment's Superhero League of Hoboken and Adventure Soft's Elvira: Mistress of the Dark , a spinoff of the TV show that the game's store page claims is 100 hours long.

You'll certainly have less of it by the time you're done reading this review, and less still if you decide to pick up Hyperbeat: a rhythm game that roped me in with its oddball UI, low-poly dreamscapes, and atmospheric central hub full of NPCs eager to introspect with you. It is a small, severe world that quickly charmed me. While all rhythm games are about timing, time writ large, which you have a little less of by now, is Hyperbeat's foremost obsession. One hub NPC is a musician who longs for their bygone depression, if only because it was a source of inspiration in the days before their \"flop era.\" Another is a churlish artist whose precious moments are wasted fretting over the feedback of an audience (or talking to you, for that matter).

Former Rockstar cofounder Dan Houser recently explained that the project was killed due to \"bandwidth issues\" within Rockstar management, and the chances of a modern revival are slim given how long it's taken the studio to make Grand Theft Auto 6 . But Rockstar's original schoolyard simulator is about to receive a new lease of life. Thanks to a team of modders, Bully is getting an online mode, the enthusiast equivalent of what GTA Online is to GTA 5 . If you think that comparison is overblown, well, it probably is, given the years and countless dollars Rockstar has pumped into its multiplayer version of Los Santos. Nonetheless, Bully Online is still far more involved than I expected. Not only does the mod open up the town of Bullworth for persistent multiplayer shenanigans, but it also adds numerous supplementary systems to Rockstar's virtual playground. These include a roleplaying system, player-based inventory, and a trading system that lets you earn money and spend it on houses, weapons, vehicles etc. The mod also introduces several minigames to Bully, some of which are pretty …",

That testing phase is rapidly approaching its end, however, as PP has announced its survival roguelike will arrive in early access on November 20. For the uninitiated, Prologue: Go Wayback is a deceptively simple game about hiking from a cabin in the woods to a distant weather tower, where each run is completely unique thanks to maps generated by the studio's homebrewed machine-learning technology. Normally generative AI use is a huge no from me, but PP's systems are built in-house, created using publicly available data and used only to generate the game's hyper-realistic terrain, which is then supplemented by more traditional procgen systems and 3D art. I remain sceptical about the functional benefits the ML tech brings, but it's a more nuanced use-case than a studio trying to replace human workers with ChatGPT or whatever. As for the game …",

North Line's biggest addition will be the Stella Montis map, adding a new region of the Rust Belt that's currently, tantalizingly locked on the in-game world map.

While the patent application in question, JP 2024-031879 , isn't directly relevant to the Palworld lawsuit, it's related to patents that are: It's the child application of one of the patents asserted in Nintendo's accusations and is itself the parent application of another. The rejection, therefore, could give Pocketpair a rhetorical opportunity to encourage a similar investigation of the patents it's accused of infringing.

Well, luckily, Corsair has announced a new professional-looking fighter stick, and I can't wait to lose at my local tournament with it. The Novablade Pro Wireless has Hall effect magnetic switches, which not only ensure a longer shelf life but also allow custom actuation on the board. Keys can be set from anywhere to 0.1mm to 4mm, which means you can make surrounding keys a little harder to press and important ones easier to hit. Corsair says switches can be hit up to 150 million times, which is approximately three games for the average button basher. Speaking of button bashers, this fight controller has rapid trigger keys, which means they stop pressing the second you do. A more traditional switch starts and stops pressing at a certain actuation, which means you are losing milliseconds with each hit. That allows you to not only hit keys quicker, but also more often. Being wireless, it can be connected via Bluetooth, or connected to your rig in 2.4 GHz mode, offering lower latency th…",

I've been pretty exclusively using lightweight wireless gaming mice for the last few years, so I'm always surprised by how many people are still sceptical. Over the years, I've seen the scepticism from comments on my articles and reviews, various online discussion boards, and even friends and colleagues. So I'm here to defend what is, in my perhaps not-so-humble opinion, one of the best upgrades you can make if you're into shooters, which is using a lightweight wireless gaming mouse. I know a lot of gamers will read this and think duh , but this isn't for them; it's for those who are still clinging on to the familiar, like I was for so long. And such people do exist: I've seen them. Plenty of people won't give a lightweight mouse a real go, and some still won't try out wireless. Switching to a lightweight wireless gaming mouse has probably given me the biggest upgrade to my gaming experience I've had since I jumped from a 60 Hz to a 144 Hz monitor back in the day.

The idea seemed to spring out of discussions around the capabilities of the upcoming Tesla AI5 chip, which is said to be up to 40x faster than the current Tesla AI4 chip fitted to many of its cars (via Tom's Hardware ). Musk openly wondered if the upcoming chip \"might almost be too much intelligence for a car\", which led to his pitching of a concept he seems to have been rolling around for a while: \"One of the things I thought,\" said Musk, \"If we've got all of these cars that maybe are bored... we could actually have a giant distributed inference fleet... if they're not actively driving\" \"At some point, if you've got 100 million cars in the fleet... and let's say they had, at the point, a kilowatt of inference capability... that's 100 gigawatts of inference distributed with cooling and power conversion taken care of.

Jerry O'Flaherty, art director on the original Deus Ex, gave his reaction to the remaster during a recent sit-down with FRVR . It did not seem positive. \"Oh, what the fuck,\" said O'Flaherty. \"No. This did not need to happen. Sorry whoever was involved in this. Oh man, yeah, no.\" So not exactly a thumbs-up, there. Still, O'Flaherty does—sort of—get a bit more positive. \"If you’re gonna do it, yeah, alright, why not? Why am I judging?\" Which is less approval so much as it is resignation to the whims of fate. I can't fault the guy. Deus Ex was never a graphical powerhouse, but it had a vibe and a cohesive aesthetic all the way back in the year 2000. \"You wanted to lean into what the engine did well and don’t do the shit that it doesn’t do well,\" said O'Flaherty. The remaster, as we've seen it so far, trades all that in for a slapdash up-rezzing of everything, making the game too bright, too bulky, and strangely even more archaic-looking than it did originally.

Narrative twists and turns follow, leading through a story that's not especially novel but still manages to deliver surprises. A lot of that arises from your freedom to make a mess of things: Your in-game avatar isn't the most hard-charging videogame hero imaginable, and there are many ways to die, most of them awful.

This lets you overlay a preset outfit onto your character's gear, and like all MMOs, it's the true endgame. Let's be real, we're just here to play dress-up. We know what we are. There is one caveat, though—you can't glamour items meant for other classes or jobs onto your gear. So a set made for a Fisher can't be used on, say, Lancer equipment. That is, until mid-December of this year.

Cain strikes a pretty pro-digital-distribution tone at the video's start. Being able to stick a game on Steam rather than order print runs of discs means devs have more time to work on games (because there's less lead time between finishing development and shipping), it means games are easier to patch, and it means old games—like the many classics Cain worked on—can remain easily accessible in, hopefully, perpetuity. But where things really heat up is with Cain's thoughts on how digital distribution has impacted game pricing. \"Digital is cheaper,\" says Cain. \"It's cheaper for everybody. It's less cost all around. \"In theory,\" he continues, \"prices should've dropped, but they didn't.\" In Cain's telling of events, rather than spread the wealth out of sheer generosity of spirit, the capitalists just kind of, well, kept it. \"You know those cost savings for being digital?
