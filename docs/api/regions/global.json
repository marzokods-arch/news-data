On Monday, US District Judge Sidney Stein denied objections that OpenAI raised, claiming that Magistrate Judge Ona Wang failed to adequately balance the privacy interests of ChatGPT users who are not involved in the litigation when ordering OpenAI to produce 20 million logs.

That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "In late 2023, storage company Western Digital announced plans to split itself into two companies. One, which would still be called Western Digital, would focus on spinning hard drives, which are no longer used much in consumer systems but remain important to NAS devices and data centers. The other, called SanDisk, would handle solid-state storage, including the drives that Western Digital sold to consumers under its Blue, Black, Green, and Red brands. That split effectively undid what Western Digital did a decade ago when it bought SanDisk for $19 billion . And we're just now starting to see the way the split will affect the company's existing consumer drives. Today, SanDisk announced that mainstream WD Blue and WD Black SSDs would be discontinued and replaced by SanDisk Optimus-branded disks with the same model numbers. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "We'll admit that we weren't paying enough attention to the state of Anthem —BioWare's troubled 2019 jetpack-powered open-world shooter—to notice EA's July announcement that it was planning to shut down the game's servers. But with that planned server shutdown now just a week away, we thought it was worth alerting you readers to your final opportunity to play one of BioWare's most ambitious failures. Anthem was unveiled at E3 2017 in a demo that was later revealed to have been largely faked to paper over major issues with the game's early development. Anthem’ s early 2019 release was met with a lot of middling-to-poor reviews (including one from Ars itself ), followed about a year later by a promise from BioWare General Manager Casey Hudson that a \"longer-term redesign\" and \"substantial reinvention\" of the overall game experience were coming. Hudson left BioWare in December 2020 , though, and a few months later, that planned Anthem overhaul was officially canceled . While active development on Anthem has been dormant for years, the game's servers have remained up and running. And though the game didn't exactly explode in popularity during that period of benign neglect, estimates fr…",
