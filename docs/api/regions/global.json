    "body": "A tale of two laptops, this little article of mine is. Or perhaps I should say a tale of two GPUs instead. Recently, I had the luxury of reviewing Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 RTX 5060 gaming notebook, and to be honest, it left quite an impression. Although not perfect in every aspect, its performance is outstanding, and when paired with a crisp 15.6-inch IPS panel, it thankfully delivers an exceptional gaming experience no matter what I chuck at it. Even in spite of its weird and not-wonderful SSD and RAM combo. When the Gigabyte Gaming A16 landed on my desk not long after, complete with that same RTX 5060 and a similar 1920 x 1200 IPS display, I was hopeful that perhaps the foibles Lenovo had introduced in its own model could be remedied by a brand with a bit more sensibility. A bit more gaming panache, let's say. And that's the key thing here. The Gigabyte A16 and the Lenovo Gen10 are both priced at around $1,300 or thereabouts (there's some confusion on the British front, but I'll talk about that in a bit). Both feature damn near close enough the same form factor, and both are targeting the same budget-centric audience as well, and come with remarkably similar hardware underneath. On…",

    "body": "Just nine months after its open-world roguelike Hyper Light Breaker hit early access, Heart Machine has hit the rocks. Per Game Developer , the studio is laying off an indeterminate number of staff and ending development on its most recent game, which encountered a rough reception when it launched into early access in January, with players lamenting performance issues, control problems, bugs, and the fact that the game might just be a smidge too hard. \"As we wrap up our work on Hyper Light Breaker, we've had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members\", wrote the studio in a statement. \"This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances\". Heart Machine doesn't go into detail about just what circumstances it's referring to, but it's not hard to deduce at least some of them. Unlike its previous games—Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash—which both enjoy popularity and acclaim, Hyper Light Breaker currently sits at a 64% Mixed user-review rating on Steam, and I suspect it will stay there or get worse with development coming to an end. Reception is not the same thing as sales, but it hardly feels like a leap to th…",

There's nothing quite like dropping into a Battlefield game on day one and enjoying the pure carnage and chaos of a good Conquest match. For those who played the beta, you'll know that Battlefield 6 is shaping up to be a solid instalment to the series, channelling its iconic large-scale warfare experience. Battlefield 6 is set to release on October 10, but this is different based on time zone, so when you can actually play will vary. There also isn't any early access to the game (no, not even with the deluxe edition), though pre-purchasing will get you the Tombstone Pack, which has an additional skin. For those who want to shell out even more, there's the Phantom Edition, which contains a whole heap of extra bits that are listed on the Steam page. All that said, here's the Battlefield 6 release time for each region so you know when you can start playing.

Well, maybe not completely, as you'll be able to receive Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for a year if you pay $30, or even for free if you live in the European Economic Area (EEA) . But those are just security updates; there will be no more feature updates for the OS and further support from developers for their apps will also slowly phase out, too. So, Windows 10 is effectively dunzo. And that fact has made me a little sadder than I thought it might. Not very sad—it's just an operating system—but a little. I was pondering why that is, because I tend to do just fine with Windows 11 and have used it pretty much since release. I think it's because of what it represents. It is, as you can see from my beautifully crafted headline above, the sound of the doors closing on the last time I felt my PC was truly my own. There are plenty of specific little things I don't particularly like about Windows 11 compared to Windows 10—the subtler taskbar icons, the simplified context menu, the strong-arming into signing into an online Microsoft account, and so on—but it's not any one little thing …",

The Steel Confessors are an interesting example, because they didn't vanish in the lore, but out here in the real world of primary sources. While references to them in White Dwarf magazine and the Index Astartes exist, the main source of detail about the Steel Confessors was a flimsy pamphlet handed out at the official Games Day & Golden Demon convention in 2005. Since nobody could source a copy of it, all the detail contained within was basically a big \"citation needed\" and has been a point of contention in the 40K fandom for 20 years.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Food and videogames have gone hand in hand since Pac-Man gobbled down his first few cherries. In games, food can represent all sorts of things: a way to replenish health or stamina, a source of power-ups or buffs, or a skill to level up while cooking over a stove or campfire. A special meal can be a gift to bestow on an NPC you're in love with, a cultural milestone in a city builder, or even a way to assassinate someone—as with Oblivion's famous poisoned apples. Since every gamer is well-versed in the importance of food, I'm giving you a culinary challenge in today's quiz. Identify the 10 games below based only on a screenshot of their food. Time to see if you can cook! It's not as easy as it sounds—if you haven't played one of the games in the quiz, you probably won't recognize its edible items—but there should be enough context in the screenshots to give you some idea of what game it's from, even if you've never chowed down on it. Just type in your answer below…",

Rainbow Six Siege saw a big boost in player numbers earlier this year when the X update went live, from more than 66,000 concurrents on Steam on June 9, according to SteamDB , to more than 142,000 on June 10.

User reviews have also taken a turn downward: The overall rating on Steam remains \"very positive\" but recent reviews are \"mixed,\" with an uptick in cheaters seemingly the most common complaint. Improving Rainbow Six Siege X's anti-cheat is the first priority for the dev team: Game director Joshua Mills and creative director Alex Karpazis wrote in today's update that \"our systems in Siege X did not keep pace with the surge of cheaters that followed the move to Free Access, though we have made some progress.\" The update doesn't go into d…",

The isolated authoritarian regime uses hacking groups, including the infamous Lazarus Group, to target both large crypto companies and wealthy individuals, with the proceeds being used to prop up a country that, by any metric, is an economic basket case: the United Nations estimates such activity now accounts for 13% of North Korea's GDP. An increased focus on targeting individuals with large crypto wealth has seen North Korean hackers make off with more than $2 billion so far this year alone, according to investigators at Elliptic , a research firm dedicated to identifying and stopping cybercrime ( thanks, BBC ). Elliptic says such individuals are \"increasingly attractive targets\" because they often lack \"the security measures employed by businesses.\" Some individuals are targeted due to an association with businesses holding large amounts of cryptoassets. This in turn has led to more hacks achieved through social engineering, rather than security flaws, which introduces further problems in estimating just how much of this activity is going on: individuals are less likely to report what's happened to …",

There are various metrics to determine payouts: session length, player count, and whether players go on to buy anything. This isn't chump change either: Epic says it pays out millions of dollars every year to community creators. So two miscreants took a look at that situation, and came up with a plan.

Release date October 10, 2025 Expect to pay $40 Developer Supermassive Games Publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment Reviewed on RTX 3060 (laptop), Ryzen 5 5600H, 16GB RAM Steam Deck Verified Link Steam The Little Nightmares games are humble in their intent, and that’s what makes them tick. You’re a tiny weakling moving forward through a hostile world. Where are you going? You just don’t know. Why are you there? It's a dream. Why do all these trauma-inducing monstrosities want to kill you? Because you’re there. These games are not works of narrative genius and that’s entirely to their credit. They’re cinematic platformers in the Inside mould, but they tell you nothing and rely entirely on implication. As far as we know, our freakish little protags have been on the run from diabolical terrors forever. In Little Nightmares 3 we can glean a lot about the sordid realities of the environments we move through, but we never learn with any certainty what that means to us, or how we fit into it. We’re just running away. When I’m squirrelling through tiny crawlspaces in a horrible industrial candy factory-cum-Ama…",

Plus, I can't help but compare this creepy old house to Resident Evil's Spencer Mansion, but there's no Albert to be found.

I, on the other hand, didn't, or at least I didn't think I'd encounter a huge monster with a claw for its hand so soon after I just got to grips with outsmarting a murder of crows.

Out tomorrow, I spoke with some of Absolum's developers at Dotemu about their creative process behind the cast of four: Galandra (broadsword-swinging warrior), Karl (stout dwarven brawler), Cider (the prosthetic ninja), and Brome (frog wizard). PC Gamer: What was the top-level, guiding idea in designing Absolum's characters? Maxime Mary, art director and co-creative lead: As Dotemu used to reinvent old IPs for contemporary players, we looked at old fantasy games like Golden Axe or Dungeons and Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara as a starting point and looked at how we could modernize them. So the four playable characters had to have this “classic” vibe. We have the dwarf, the warrior, the magician, the rogue, but we wanted to have something that fits more with our modern culture.

There are plenty of potential suspects you can point the finger at, and you have to choose one whether you've got damning evidence or not. Spoiler: you will never have damning evidence. Regardless of who you send under the headsman's axe, you'll always have a queasy feeling that they might not be the one who did it. In a chat with PCG at this year's GDC, Pentiment director Josh Sawyer said that's entirely the point. \"From the very beginning I said, 'I think that for this to be compelling in the way that I want it to be, there cannot be a right answer'\". In fact, it sounds like Sawyer himself doesn't have a clear culprit in mind for the game's evildoings. \"People on the team would ask me [who the culprit is], then people at Xbox would ask me, and I'm like, 'No!

But that punishing permadeath for everything the sandworm swallows has been de-fanged, at least a little bit: a new patch for Funcom's survival MMO means that you don't have to lose your vehicle forever even if it goes down a sandworm's gullet. There's a catch, however. Thanks to the new \"vehicle recovery system\" added in Dune: Awakening patch 1.2.10.0, your vehicle backup tool now literally backs up your rides instead of just acting like a handheld garage. \"When vehicles that you personally own are removed from the world by the sandworm, coriolis storms, or complete destruction via combat they can now be recovered for a fee from a new Recovery mode in the Vehicle Backup Tool,\" says Funcom.

Diablo 4's two methods of crafting—if you can call them that—stick out as features that solved necessary problems at the time, but are now more of a nuisance than anything. Blizzard added tempering and masterworking to keep loot from feeling static. Both systems give any piece of gear the potential to be an upgrade by letting you customize what stats are on them and how powerful they are. The problem is that both of them are based purely on luck.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the news in Stockholm, Sweden. Professor John Clarke, Professor Michel H. Devoret and Professor John M. Martinis are the new Nobel laureates. Clarke is from the UK and now works at the University of California in Berkeley; Devoret is from Paris, France and works at Yale; Martinis is American and works at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

I might still be a little sceptical, but I see the vision now. Romping about the game's carriages with ad-hoc armaments, getting the drop on other players, and seeing the ruined world zip by out the window: it works better than it maybe should, and provides ample space for you and other players to gin up temporary, make-do alliances that you betray the nanosecond it becomes profitable.

And it's not just me: Bungie's recent moves have done nothing to stop players from leaving, at least if Steam's data is considered representative of the playerbase at large. Yesterday, Destiny 2 posted its lowest daily peak concurrent player count in the game's history—16,067 players. That 'beats' the previous low of 18,023 back in the doldrums of Revenant—the last expansion cycle's worst episode. It's worth remembering that peak daily concurrents offer us a very limited picture: The number of players simultaneously in-game during Destiny 2's busiest period. It doesn't tell us how many players actually logged into the game over the course of the day. Nor does it tell us what the game's population is on other platforms.

The Havn style introduced with the HS 420 is still going strong with the BF 360. A style that's very appealing to me, personally, with rounded corners and long vents for increased airflow through the front and top panels and down the rear of the chassis.
