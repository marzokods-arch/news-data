I’ve spent at least half as many hours reading about Silksong these past few days as I have playing it. And honestly, under the circumstances—the media didn’t get a head start here—that feels like the best way to go about playing and thinking about this curious game, which will likely delight or disappoint depending on your attitude going in. I really like it so far, but there are some things that annoy me about it, and I don't think it lives up to the hype through no fault of its own. I’m still not completely sure why Hollow Knight got as big as it did. I totally agree that it’s a great videogame and an outstanding metroidvania. Few games in this genre trust and reward the curiosity of the player as much as Hollow Knight did, and Silksong is no different in this regard. But this doesn't sufficiently explain its popularity. Maybe it's because Team Cherry's melancholy and quietly eccentric world is, in subtle ways, pretty different to anything we’ve explore…",

In one of the game's standout scenes, BJ Blazkowicz finds himself infiltrating a Nazi base on Venus by auditioning for the role of himself in a propaganda movie. It's revealed during the audition that the Fuhrer is executive producing, and a tense, Tarantinoesque standoff ensues. The clearly addled, declining Adolf lurches around the room, muttering about conspiracies and personally executing the actors that fail to impress him. He even urinates right on the floor⁠—more on that in a second. \"We're starting from, 'What would be the coolest locations to play in?'\" said MachineGames co-founder Jens Matthies. \"We want to do Area 52 and we want to do Venus.

    "body": "Everything's cool in Silksong until you're stuck trying to escape The Slab with nothing but your bare bug fists. Getting out of bug prison is hard work. There are several guards and deceptively precise jumps standing between you and freedom. The real reward for completing The Slab is getting out with your stuff back, but there's a Lost Flea to rescue, a Spool Fragment , and some Rosaries to collect there too. Most people will probably find The Slab by getting kidnapped in Act 1, but it's possible to get there in Act 2 without losing your stuff. Being a completionist, I intentionally got myself locked up early on to see what the fuss was about, so the advice below is written from that perspective. It won't be as harrowing if you decide to wait until Act 2 though because you can leave at any time. How to find The Slab in Silksong (Image credit: Tyler C. / Team Cherry) The Slab is a somewhat hidden area no matter when you decide to enter it. In Act 1, you can find an armored flea enemy with a cage on the right side of the Deep Docks area. Alternatively, you can find one in Greymoor if you've progressed the The Lost Fleas quest far enough for the caravan to move a second time. The arm…",

This challenging boss is also one of the most fun in Act 1 of Hollow Knight: Silksong, thanks to a quick runback from the nearest bench and a number of attacks that deal only one damage to Hornet rather than the more painful double hits of so many Silksong bosses. The Widow is fast but her attacks are well-telegraphed, so with a little study and patience you can learn her patterns and get through the first phase by making use of your drifter's cloak and new cling grip ability. The second phase gets a bit more chaotic, but I've got some tips for how to beat the Widow in phase two before she smooshes you to death with a rain of bells. What do you need to fight Widow? Here's what I used to beat the Widow, but there's no must-have bit of gear for this fight . I guess that's both good and bad—there's no way to trivialize this fight with a specific weapon, but it also means you don't need to be out there grinding for rosaries before the battle.

Thankfully, those of us playing on PC have the tools at hand to redraw the line between \"challenging\" and \"excruciating\" in a more comfortable position. If Silksong's expecting more from you than you want to give, here's a pair of mods that can soften some of the sharpest pain points. (Image credit: TeamCherry) Quick disclaimer: Both mods require version 5.4.23.3 of the BepInEx plugin framework . To install it, grab the x64 .zip from the Github repo and extract to Silksong's installation directory. You'll need to run the game once to generate necessary config files. Then, to install either of the mods below, just place their associated .dll file in the /BepInEx/plugins folder in your Silksong directory.

This is far from a confirmation, though, and the original game's many ending permutations complicate the character's potential return. Asked if he'd be willing to reprise the character in Cyberpunk 2⁠—formerly codenamed Project Orion⁠—Reeves said: \"Absolutely, I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again.\" And that's it, that's all he said on the matter. But it's more than we had previously, and it also raises questions as to how CDPR could continue his story. A very remote possibility is reflecting Cyberpunk 2077 choices through Witcher or Mass Effect-style save importing, but that doesn't feel like a good fit. 2077 was a very personal, self-contained story, one where putting in that effort doesn't particularly feel worth it. That's also before you consider that we likely won't even see Cyberpunk 2 before 2030⁠—10 years after Cyberpunk 2077's release⁠—and that it'd be a pretty crazy ask to cut Keanu Reeves a check for content not all players will see.

Acutis was canonised in an ancient ritual led by Pope Leo, who himself has a good shout to be the first gaming Pope . The teenager's path to sainthood has been remarkably short: the campaign to have him canonised began six years after his death in 2012; he was decreed \"Venerable\" in 2018, \"Blessed\" in 2020, and now the Pope has formally declared Acutis a saint in St Peter's Square in Vatican City. Born in London, Acutis was still a baby when his Italian parents returned home, and he would spend the rest of his life in Milan. Acutis' family recalls him enjoying videogames including, of course, Halo, as well as the likes of Mario and Pokémon. He got a PlayStation when he was eight but, as a true servant of the Lord, restricted himself to one hour of play a day. It should also be said that Acutis was clearly a remarkable child.

While you can farm a fair few Rosaries in Mosshome by running back and forth between the bench on the left side of The Marrow, and in Deep Docks, this farm is located in Act 2 in the Choral Chambers , and will net you basically everything you need in a pretty safe way. If you're not in Act 2 yet then look away now, or come back later when you are. When entering the Choral Chambers (after you've purchased the map), instead of heading straight up, you'll want to head over to the right and climb that side instead, making your way up to the First Shrine structure in the far top right. When you get here, ring the bell by freeing it with Silk Spear and then rest on the bench. I then recommend you head left, jump up the platforms all the way to the very top and open the Ventrica system here. It's also advisable to open the Ventrica at the Gra…",

Still, Intel sponsors a lot of esports tournaments, and as a result, esports pros have been forced to use Intel rigs—and some of them, it seems, have been having a particularly bad time. Hardware Unboxed has highlighted some of these pro player complaints on X, directly quoting professional Counter Strike 2 player ropz, who complains the game only runs well (by esports standards, presumably) on a Ryzen 7 9800X3D , and that \"not every tournament has that.\" The replies are full of complaints regarding the difference in performance between Intel CPUs and AMD X3D chips, with the delta between the two sometimes claimed to be 100 fps+.

The route you'll need to take looks a little like this: (Image credit: Team Cherry) Make sure you've got 60 rosaries before starting, ideally secured in the form of a consumable string or a necklace. Start at the halfway home bench, take the elevator, then hop across the rickety platforms to get into Sinner's Road proper. Dodge the dogs in the long hallway (you can use the cages to avoid most of them) and then arrive at the central chamber.

That's because of the ever-present spectre of AI hanging over our gaming hardware hopes and dreams. After all, AI hardware is where Nvidia makes the vast majority of its money these days, and given the recent loosening of chip export restrictions, I'd say it's a safer bet that most of this memory is destined for China-friendly RTX Pro 6000 variants and the like. Boo. Still, ETnews reports that Nvidia has told Samsung to double up its GDDR7 production—according to its industry sources—and that the Korean DRAM manufacturer has duly responded.

Delving into the labyrinthine interiors, we're shown towering, yellow-lit rooms of phenomenal scale, along with the arrival of advanced lithography equipment , vital for the production of TSMC's newest processes.

If you've been paying attention to the discourse—I wouldn't blame you for not doing so—around Silksong , you'll have heard that it's hard , and also kind of cruel.

In the press images it creates this layered look, almost as if you've broken through several pains of ice and can see light coming from the surface.

The face buttons reflect this colour combination creating a really cohesive design that almost looks like it would be cold to touch.

Whether you're looking at a GPU powerhouse like Nvidia or SSD champions like Micron, everyone is looking to get a piece of the AI pie. One of the latest to the game is Acer, which recently showed off its new mini AI machine at a recent launch event in Germany. Notably though, like other machines we've seen of this ilk, the announcement is all specs and no price or availability. CTEE.com spotted this mini AI workstation from Acer during the company's presentation last week. Dubbed the Acer Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation, the mini machines sports a Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip and is aimed at both smaller institutions and individuals looking to tackle AI workloads. Acer's own listing of the Veriton GN100 details the specs further. Apparently they've packed 128 GB of unified memory, as well as up to 4 TB of NVMe M.2 SSD storage into this box that looks about twice the of Mac Mini. Acer boasts that the configuration adds up to deliver up to 1 petaflop of powerful AI compute performance. This is on par with Nvidia's own mini AI PC powerhouse, the DGX Spark. We know a few things about DGX Spar…",

It requires lithography machines to print and scale these silicon thinking machines. High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet , or High NA EUV, lithography tools are among some of the newest and most cutting-edge methods of making chips. These have been recently applied to the industry by big players like Intel in the hopes of stepping ahead of the game, but they might have been beaten to the punch when it comes to commercial application of these machines. A High NA EUV lithography system has just been set up for mass production by SK hynix in its M16 fab based in Icheon, South Korea. SK hynix is a company known for making storage and memory chips. Its using a TWINSCAN EXE:5200B lithography system, as opposed to the 5000 that Intel setup last year, in an effort to produce what will likely be some of the most powerful DRAM ever made. This new system boasts the ability to print transistors 1.7 times smaller than previous High NA EUV machines. It also delivers 2.9 times the existing transistor densities, providing what SK hynix says is a 40% improvement in the NA …",

Shiny Shoe shared with PC Gamer exclusively four of the cards appearing in the update, and provided commentary on each of them.

While other Razer headsets have had refreshes it’s been a while since we’ve seen anything from the Kitty line since the V2 pro, and ear obsessed gamers have had to make do with the V2 specs for a few years. The new Kraken Kitty V3 s come in two options, the Pro and X variants. The pro is the beefier, and pricier option coming in at $180 USD or $330 AUD where as the X is the cheaper lightweight option and will set you back $60 USD or $110 AUD.

Which created an unexpected problem for Nightdive when it came time to do one of its Kex engine remasters, as lead producer Daniel Grayshon explained in a recent episode of Nightdive's Deep Dives. Because System Shock 2, unlike some of the early FPSes Nightdive has remastered, was fully voice-acted. \"We'd not really ever done a voice recording session at all for a Kex game,\" Grayshon said. \"We'd never really needed to.

The hackers were able to: Easily access RBI's Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems. Create new user accounts. Promote themselves to admin status. Access employees' personal information. Order store equipment. Add and manage stores. Access store tablet interfaces. Access voice recordings of customers ordering at the drive-thru—which the pair allege are being used to train an AI model. The pair of hackers explained their project and findings in a blog post that went live on September 6, only to be taken down within 24 hours and replaced with a notice that they received a DMCA complaint from RBI.

    "body": "One of System Shock 2 's more unusual quirks is how it supports four player co-op. This was extremely rare in PC gaming in general at the tail end of the nineties, and it makes System Shock 2 unique among the classic immersive sims. With its 25 th anniversary remaster, Nightdive Studios wanted to ensure this co-op functionality was brought up to date with the rest of System Shock 2. Yet according to producer Daniel Grayshon, getting it to work was a nightmare worthy of SHODAN herself. Speaking on the Nightdive Studios Deep Dive podcast, Grayshon explains the sticking point was how System Shock 2 uses an old-fashioned direct IP connection based on DirectPlay. \"[This] was a very old Windows built-in functionality to do some redirecting somewhere and ultimately try to end up at the destination,\" he says. Aside from DirectPlay being insecure by modern standards, Nightdive also wanted the remaster to support crossplay between PS5, Xbox, Switch and so forth. \"We need to strip this out, completely strip this out. We can't have direct connections anymore because the consoles will not allow that at all,\" Grayshon explains. \"We need to construct some kind of lobby system, and we need to tap…",

Monster and Monster's hybrid trucking sim dedicates itself to synthesising grand journeys across the cosmos with the specific vehicle handling and road networks of Euro Truck Simulator 2 . The combination was relatively well received by players when Star Trucker launched in 2024, earning itself a \"Mostly Positive\" rating on Steam out of just under 3,000 reviews. Now Monster and Monster is celebrating a whole year of interplanetary logistics, with the double delivery of an anniversary update and a big discount. Said anniversary update brings a container's worth of new features to Star Trucker, foremost among which is peripheral support. Henceforth, you can increase the realism of driving a rocket-propelled truck along roads strung through space by plugging in the joystick/steering wheel/custom Millennium Falcon dashboard of your choice. While the update is designed to accommodate the broadest range of peripherals possible, in a dev blog Monster and Monster points out that it is a small team and therefore \"it's …",

It expanded upon SnowRunner's logistics simulation with systems like convoy automation and an emphasis on constructing road networks (hence the name). But these bigger features came at the cost of a more simplistic driving model, leaving players who preferred the stern navigational challenge of SnowRunner put out. Now, though, Saber has released an update to RoadCraft that folds some of that driving complexity back in. Or at least, it gives players the option to reinstate it themselves if they so choose. The update adds a \"hard mode\" to RoadCraft in the form of several difficulty modifiers, each of which can be toggled on or off depending on how granular you want the experience to be. For driving fans, the key additions are limited fuel and \"realistic\" gearboxes—the latter of which basically means that RoadCraft now supports manual gear-shifting. Frankly, it's wild that RoadCraft launched without this functionality. Fuel management and manual driving are standard features in most dedicated driving sims, let alone a game born from the legacy of SnowRunner…",

July brought an improved mission system and more realistic erosion, while August saw the return of hardcore mode in tougher, meaner form. September's update is by far the smallest for a while. But there is one adjustment that has potentially game-altering ramifications, and it all has to do with the noise that guns make. Basically, Facepunch has altered how sound propagation for firearms works, so gunshots can be heard at significantly longer distances than before. Implementing this was more complicated than you might expect, as Facepunch explains in a Steam post : \"Networking range in Rust is made up of grids,\" the developer explains. \"These grids are a fixed size and can be adjusted by server owners, they are sometimes reduced on high-populated community servers to lower network overhead. When these grids are reduced, it also reduces things like: gun audio. This makes the world feel incredibly small and closed off.\" But Facepunch now says Rust can \"run gunshots at different distances to the network range\" though…",
