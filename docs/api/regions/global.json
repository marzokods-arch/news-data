    "body": "Over the last century, much of the US pulp and paper industry crowded into the southeastern corner of the nation, setting up mills amid sprawling timber forests to strip the fibers from juvenile loblolly, long leaf, and slash pine trees. Today, after the factories chip the softwood and digest it into pulp, the leftover lignin, spent chemicals, and remaining organic matter form a dark, syrupy by-product known as black liquor. It’s then concentrated into a biofuel and burned, which heats the towering boilers that power the facility—and releases carbon dioxide into the air. Microsoft , JP MorganChase , and a tech company consortium that includes Alphabet, Meta, Shopify, and Stripe have all recently struck multimillion-dollar deals to pay paper mill owners to capture at least hundreds of thousands of tons of this greenhouse gas by installing carbon scrubbing equipment in their facilities. The captured carbon dioxide will then be piped down into saline aquifers more than a mile underground, where it should be sequestered permanently. Big Tech is suddenly betting big on this form of carbon removal, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS. The sector also includes bi…",

A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging, might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active. Over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging.

The Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity Tim Wu KNOPF, 2025 In The Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity, Tim Wu argues that a few platform companies have too much concentrated power and must be dismantled. Wu, a prominent Columbia professor who popularized the principle that a free internet requires all online traffic to be treated equally, believes that existing legal mechanisms, especially anti-monopoly laws, offer the best way to achieve this goal. Pairing economic theory with recent digital history, Wu shows how platforms have shifted from giving to users to extracting from them. He argues that our failure to under…",

At the Keck Observatory, in Hawaii, just as many segments make up a mirror that spans 33 feet, reflecting images of uncharted worlds for her to study.&nbsp; Jensen-Clem, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, works with the Keck Observatory to figure out how to detect new planets without leaving our own. Typically, this pursuit faces an array of obstacles: Wind, fluctuations in atmospheric density and temperature, or even a misaligned telescope mirror can create a glare from a star’s light that obscures the view of what’s around it, rendering any planets orbiting the star effectively invisible. And what light Earth’s atmosphere doesn’t obscure, it absorbs. That’s why researchers who study these distant worlds often work with space telescopes that circumvent Earth’s pesky atmosphere entirely, such as the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope.&nbsp; But there’s another way over these hurdles. At her lab among the redwoods, Jensen-Clem and her students experiment with new technologies and software to help Keck’s primary honeycom…",

How do our bodies remember? “Like riding a bike” is shorthand for the remarkable way that our bodies remember how to move. Most of the time when we talk about muscle memory, we’re not talking about the muscles themselves but about the memory of a coordinated movement pattern that lives in the motor neurons, which control our muscles. Yet in recent years, scientists have discovered that our muscles themselves have a memory for movement and exercise. And the more we move, as with riding a bike or other kinds of exercise, the more those cells begin to make a memory of that exercise.
