    "body": "A trailer dropped today for Netflix's animated Splinter Cell show, and it's all guns and glory. Bloody fistfights, car chases, a diving tackle through a window—all to unravel a mystery that hits awful close to home for our grizzled protagonist. \"Sam Fisher is back and this time, the mission is personal.\" Again! It hits all the narrative and aesthetic beats I expect out of a modern spy thriller, and through that lens, I think it looks pretty neat. There's a mysterious wristwatch with coveted blueprints inside it somehow and yes, they plug it into a giant wall of green monitors, and yes, I eat that kind of thing up. But short of a few referential nods, I think the trailer is sadly a little light on Splinter Cell vibes specifically. It's a lot of action and energy for largely methodical, unhurried stealth games. My favorite moments in Splinter Cell never involved big fist fights or car chases, they involved silently panicking as guards circled me hiding in the one safe shadow in a patrol-filled room. Guns and brawls were a sign things had gone wrong, and I was most elated when the only enemies that ever saw me ended up unconscious in a crate somewhere. Okay, maybe that wouldn't make …",

    "body": "For the first time in a while, a Diablo 4 season won't just be about fancy new powers for your build. In season 10, or the Season of Infernal Chaos , the best loot in the game can drop as \"Chaos armor\", allowing you to use items in ways you never could before. Several Unique items and their powerful guaranteed stats will have new Chaos variants that are even more powerful than normal and can be equipped in new slots on your character. The idea is that a Unique that could only drop as gloves before can now show up as a pair of boots or some other piece, which opens up all kinds of combinations and new builds. \"A lot of us in the office are fans of card games, and what you do in card gaming is you typically build a deck from a bunch of different cards,\" game designer Aislyn Hall explained when asked about the inspiration for Chaos Armor on the stream. \"When I'm building my character in an ARPG, or a Diablo, I think about it in the same lens.\" Diablo 4 seasons have never felt this experimental. Blizzard usually fixes up an existing system, like Nightmare Dungeons, and then gives you a handful of flashy powers tied to the theme. While there are still new powers in season 10—some of wh…",

One of the developers heavily affected was Zenimax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO), which saw the cancellation of an MMO codenamed Blackbird alongside an unspecified number of layoffs. Such was the impact of the latter that, despite not being included in the initial round of cuts, long-serving ZeniMax president Matt Firor fell on his sword after 18 years as studio head. \"He wore a lot of different hats,\" says Rich Lambert, the new studio game director at Zenimax, in a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz . Firor's responsibilities have been split across Lambert and new studio head Jo Burba, who's \"focused on the operational side of things, and I'm focused on a lot of studio-level things and future planning.\" Some would speculate the layoffs are what lies behind Firor's departure and, while Lambert doesn't confirm this, he make…",

Okay, yes, some version of that happens in a lot of MMOs, but it's a particular thorn in the side for Jagex and its players, leading as it does to legions of bots infesting the game in order to vacuum up gold to sell later on. Now, Jagex has decided it's no more Mr Nice Guy time: the punishments for buying gold are getting harsher. \"Buying gold off a real world trader is already very clearly against the rules, but historically we've treated the buyers more leniently than the sellers when issuing penalties for real world trading,\" said Jagex in a post earlier today .

As a case in point, redditor Substantial-Mark-959 reports they've come into possession of an early engineering sample of the RTX 2080 Ti , and it looks to be of a significantly higher spec than the release card. One Founders Edition BIOS and a modified Nvidia driver later, and Substantial-Mark-959 says they've been able to get the card up and running. The GPU-Z readout makes for some interesting reading, showing 4480 shaders, 96 ROPs, and 280 TMUs—oh, and 12 GB of VRAM, a whole gigabyte more than the released card. Got my hands on a engineering GTX 2080ti. from r/nvidia For reference, the release version of the RTX 2080 Ti has 4352 shaders, 88 ROPs, and 272 TMUs. That'd make this particular sample slightly quicker in theory, especially as it has a 384 bit bus width compared to the standard card's 352-bit version. With the cooler removed, the chip itself looks a lot like the stock TU102 die—although as another eagle-eyed redditor has noticed, it doesn't have any markings showing the model designation. So, why did we end up with a less-powerfully-specced variant in the…",

    "body": "Switching to an open world, Borderlands 4 is massive and packed full of sidequests and activities to complete, though these generally don't give you tons of experience to level up. Completing it all once is all well and good, but you won't want to trudge through every single quest again on an alternate character. That's where the best XP farms come in, netting you heaps of experience to level up fast and with less effort, so you can focus on your favourite bits. If it's your first run through the campaign, I'd generally recommend just completing the story and exploring the open world—there's little reason to grind before then. Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters . Best Borderlands 4 XP farms The two best ways to farm XP in Borderlands 4 are to complete bounty contracts and grind drill site activities , with the latter being even better when you're playing in co-op. Both options also give you tons of money and loot (there are vending machines to sell items nearby, too), including unique legendary gear, so you'll be getting more than just XP. …",

The only N2 chips AMD has planned for next year, as far as we know, are server CPUs, not GPUs. AMD's next major AI GPU release, MI450 , is expected to be on TSMC N3 silicon. Nvidia currently uses a version of TSMC's N4 node for all its GPUs. N4 is actually a refinement of N5, which dates back to 2020. Meanwhile, the first chip made on TSMC's N3 technology, the Apple A17 Pro SoC for iPhones, debuted back in 2023. Consequently, Nvidia is now bumping up against what's known as the reticle limit with its Blackwell generation of GPUs .

Loadout experimentation has always been the name of the game, which means regular pit stops to rifle through my backpack and decide what'll get added to my arsenal and what'll fund my future respawns. For a game that is so reliant on routine inventory management, Borderlands 4 has somehow managed to massively cock it up. To the point I'm confused how we're several games deep and yet this is easily Gearbox's worst attempt to date. This is coming from someone who isn't even massively fussy when it comes to clean inventory management. I just want two things: make it quick, and make it easy. Borderlands 4 does neither. Opening up the backpack greets me with a muddled array of items, which the game defaults to sorting by manufacturer. Naturally. Who doesn't want to organise their inventory by manufacturer? Organising by recently picked up, item value, or level? Psh, who would ever need such pointless options? If I do dare to veer off the game's default selection, it only lasts until I tab over to a different screen. If I accidentally turn to a different page i…",

The Old Hearts sees you heading to three previously uncharted areas, and finding the entrance to each is actually rather tricky. The Heart of the Woods, especially, has a somewhat nonsensical entrance you could theoretically spend hours trying to find. That, or you could check this guide and be on your merry way towards the area's challenging bosses instead.

Speaking of loops, I was deeply skeptical of the shift to a full open world, but now that I've properly got my teeth into it I'm a believer. Borderlands' cycle of 'shoot guys, get loot, sell loot, shoot more guys' pairs so devilishly well with this style collectible/objectives hunt that I'm shocked it took this long for Gearbox to make the shift.

    "body": "Jakobs guns have long been a top pick, and that's not changed in Borderlands 4 , with this manufacturer's shotguns being particularly lethal. So, why not take this inherent strength and pair it with a massive 90% damage boost? That's exactly what you get with the Hot Slugger . There are well over 100 legendary gear items in Borderlands 4, and the Hot Slugger should be near the top of your list, no matter which character you're playing. It's powerful, sure, but you also spin it around like a cowboy when you reload it, and that's just cool. How to get the Hot Slugger in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get the Hot Slugger from Callous Harbinger of Annihilating Death, the final boss of the Craven's Nook Order bunker in the Bones of Sanctuary , to the east of Terminus Ridge. You'll need to progress the campaign until you can leave the Fadefields region, as not only is this area far away, but you also need to remove the armour on the door—just look over the ledge to the left of the door, and you'll find a bio canister that you can throw at it to unlock the bunker. Enter the bunker, fight your way to the end, and beat Callou…",

While it works a little differently this time around, you'll still need to find Maurice's Black Market location each week. If you're a Destiny 2 convert, then Maurice's vending machine is effectively Xur. Each week, the Black Market machine will spawn in a new location somewhere on Kairos, giving you access to top-tier loot in return for cash. With Borderlands 4 moving to a full open-world with Kairos, though, you'll have even more ground to cover to track his machine down. Where is the Borderlands 4 Black Market location this week? Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) For the week of September 12 to September 19, Maurice's Black Market vending machine is located in Plungeford, in the north of Coastal Bonescape, Fadefields . You can find the vending machine on the balcony of the tallest building in the area. The Black Market machine resets every Friday at 12:00 am EDT / 5 am BST.

As a little crew of spacefaring avians, you're tasked with gathering a handful of resources like water and sulfur from some nearby asteroids. Land on one, build a launchpad, drop some extractors to gather what you need, and link the two via pipes. Sorted. There's no time pressure, and you can't go bankrupt—if you ever run out of money you can just wait until it ticks back up again, and you even get a little car you can use to drive around asteroids picking up chunks of bonus cash to speed things along. (Image credit: Toukana Interactive) Layers are gradually added—you start combining and transforming resources to get new ones, and then you're setting up networks moving resources between asteroids to get things where they're needed. But the production lines still feel simple and easy, and I was lulled into a cosy sense of security. It's what I expected from the new game from the developer of Dorfromantik. I spent many hours with that game's board game-like puzzle, free to pursue ruthless efficiency but never really encouraged to do any more than just enjoy the rustic little scenes my tiles created.

Those numbers put Borderlands 4 at #46 on the list of all-time highest Steam concurrent peaks , just below Elden Ring Nightreign, and Silksong all the way up at #17, sandwiched between Apex Legends and Path of Exile 2. I don't like to fixate too much on Steam concurrents as a measure of popularity, as they don't tell the whole story, but they are one of few direct windows into what gamers are doing that we have, and this particular figure underlines just how colossal of a success Silksong has been.

It got the job done, but it was nowhere close to the power of YouTuber Syrobe's \"easy mode\" build where you have an endless supply of powerful tools. Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it. You can pretty much equip any tools you want, but Syrobe recommends the Tacks, Silkshot, and the Voltvessels. He adds in the Pollip Pouch so every hit applies …",

As the dust settles, we're now getting our first estimates for just how many copies Silksong has sold. In its game discovery newsletter , games industry analyst firm GameDiscoverCo estimates based on available data that Hollow Knight: Silksong has already sold more than 3.2 million copies on Steam. Additionally, GameDiscoverCo reckons it's been downloaded approximately 1.5 million times through Xbox Game Pass, though it's unclear how many of those downloads were distributed between console and PC. For an indie release from a relatively small production team, that's a phenomenal success, particularly when compared with other Metroidvanias. Silksong's in a genre with no shortage of enthusiasts, but Metroidvanias aren't what we'd typically consider as having mass market appeal. Comparing Steam sales numbers against other games released this year with the Metroidvania tag, GamesDiscoverCo says \"Silksong's dominance is striking.\" U…",

But I've been a fool: despite using the attack in multiple boss fights, I actually haven't been getting as much damage out of it as I could've. Thanks to a PSA video from Jason Mondal on YouTube, I only just learned how to use Thread Storm to its full potential. Instead of pressing or holding right bumper on a controller once to activate the ability, you can rapidly mash the button to extend its duration without using more silk, giving you more damage per cast. The only downside is that this leaves you vulnerable to a counterattack for longer, but that's kind of the basic tradeoff of Thread Storm already. My preferred deployment is at a diagonal, up and slightly to the side of a boss to get them in the AOE while having a good chance of avoiding any attacks. Against enemies who can be staggered by Thread Storm, though, there's practically no disadvantage to using its max duration⁠—this ability can be a huge help during any of those tricky wave fights.

The entire build revolves around throwing knives that cause your normal damage to become critical damage. You can find the \"Penetrator Augment - Damage\" stat on any Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife in the game and it'll work regardless of the item's level. NickTew's character is level 50 and his level 35 knife works because the stat is the same no matter what.

    "body": "Completing the Passing of the Age quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong is a bit of a challenge, as you try to track the Mushroom Sage's locations across Pharloom using the riddle he left you. It's a little similar to the Great Taste of Pharloom quest in that it sees you running all over the map to find the fungi in different out-of-the-way spots. You can't access this wish until you've acquired the Silk Soar ability in Act 3 , specifically via The Dark Below quest. Once that's done, head to the right side of the Pale Lake in the Putrified Ducts (just across from Fleatopia), climb up the platforms, and use Silk Soar to enter the passage above where you'll find the riddle in question and be able to get started. Below, I'll run through all of the locations you need to find, as well as share my own (painful) experience with the final platforming section so you can see the exact route and method for getting through it.

Despite writing an article about the reaction to Nvidia's brutal optimised settings charts for Borderlands 4, and being well aware of stuttering issues thanks to Nick's performance testing piece, I jumped into the game this weekend anyway. And, lo and behold, the stuttering was very much there—until I discovered a fix that's virtually eliminated the issue on my machine. It's not my own discovery, in fact, but that of YouTuber Ki11er Six , who posted a review of the game along with a crucial performance tip a few days ago. On Nvidia graphics cards, it's possible to manually adjust the shader cache size in the Control Panel—which Ki11er Six suggests should be set to 100 GB to prevent stuttering. (Image credit: Nvidia) To perform the fix yourself, first make sure the game isn't running. Then, simply right-click on your desktop, hit \"Show more options\" (depending on how you've got your Windows context menus set up), open the Nvidia Control Panel, and navigate in the side panel to \"Manage 3D settings.\" From there, scroll down in the Global Settings tab to Shader Cache Size, use the drop-down menu to select 100 GB, and hit Apply.

Well, he's applying the ol' scientific method to people's Borderlands 4 performance complaints, pointing out that—if this game is really as stutter-prone as you horrible lot have been making it sound like —how come \"less than one percent of one percent\" of players are filing customer service tickets about performance woes? Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on. Bearing that in mind, Pitchford goes on to say that \"0.04% of customers [tickets] are PC performance related.\" The number gets smaller. Of that 0.04% o…",

These are all great additions, and I know I'll miss them the next time I replay Borderlands 2 or 3 again. Plus, if you've made it to any of the main bosses or final encounters in any of the vaults, you'll know just how much you'll have to use these in combat, especially the grapple. The unfortunate thing is, the grapple is clunky. Whenever you use your grappling hook, your camera will immediately turn to face towards the grapple spot like it's switched on aimbot for an inanimate object. Although it's done in an effort to show you where you're headed, it's enough to give you whiplash while you're rushing around the arena. What if I told you that there's a way to fix it? Head into the accessibility settings and disable ' grapple view tilt '. This'll stop control from being ripped out of your hands, letting you grapple so long as you can see the hook in your peripheral vision without automatically pulling your camera in another direction.
