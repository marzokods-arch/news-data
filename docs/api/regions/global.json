Don't forget to consider how much RAM and storage are included with a gaming laptop.

That's where design documents come in—living, comprehensive treatises that outline all a game's systems and design goals to be referenced by those working on the game—at least, for some. Johan Andersson, lead on Europa Universalis 5, said in an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens that the practice can be too rigid and restraining. For Paradox Tinto, good design comes with a bit of democracy. \"Design documents stifle creativity and it reduces people's ownership and empowerment,\" Andersson said. \"You create better games by talking with your team … tell the person some broad outlines, like 'we want this,' 'it should function like this,' a few samples, and let them make the detailed decisions.

Kato and her commenters speak Japanese, and I didn't feel like I'd get anything worthwhile out of YouTube's auto-translation feature (which presumably draws from already-garbled auto-generated captions), but there's a universal language of horror at work here that makes the stream very easy to follow regardless.

The latest trailer does just that, by informing us that Boltgun 2 will let us choose a second playable character. That character being Nyra Veyrath, a Celestian of the Sisters of Battle, to be specific. She wields a bolt pistol/power sword combo, switching to a meltagun or flamer when the enemies of the Imperium need a good superheating, and has some good mobility, with a slide move I couldn't imagine the bulky space marine Malum Caedo pulling off. As well as letting us choose between two protagonists, Boltgun 2 will have a branching campaign, with different decisions leading you through different levels. It'll also have more biomes than the first game, including a jungle swamp and a hive city to fight through. Looks like there's an ice world too?

There's also fishing , love it or hate it . If it's true that Team Soda's angle was to inject a little virality into their game with the satirical title and cutesy animals, then b…",

Europa Universalis 2, for instance, was conceived under brutal time constraints. Andersson explained, \"We came up with a bunch of ideas for what we should be doing.

In an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens , Andersson recalled one of the studio's earliest games: \"If you want to laugh, Google Valhalla Chronicles. We had the best comment ever on that one: 'bugs, many and diverse, some more interesting than the gameplay.'\" It's not a looker. But as Andersson explained, the team was \"doing multiple games at the same time\" and its take on a Baldur's Gate-inspired RPG \"did not turn out great. \"We did a lot of games with a small team of like five, six people for the first, like 10 years,\" he said. \"We became Paradox in 1999 and Paradox Interactive in 2005.

No videogame genre has birthed more bangers than the humble JRPG. I mean, come on, can you even imagine a world where a track like One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy 7 doesn't exist? Or where we never got to hear a real monk chanting absolute bars over Metaphor: ReFantazio's orchestral battle theme? A timeline where we never get to experience the delicate piano of Kingdom Hearts' Dearly Beloved washing over us when booting up the game? I certainly can't, which is why I maintain that JRPG music is some of the best in the biz. It kind of has to be, really. Not only will they probably be some of the longest videogames you ever play—hello to my triple-digit Persona 5 Royal playtime—but they'll also probably take you through every feeling you could ever experience.

From the first moment you step foot on Paradise Island, you'll start discovering all sorts of strange murder contraptions, from a sniper rifle that fires sneaky explosive bolts you detonate when you reload, to a pistol that infects enemies with a contagious disease they can spread. The strangest weapon by far that I've discovered in my travels through Arcadia, though, is a sword that turns combat into a rhythm game. Yes, you read that correctly—if you don't slash and slice to the old timey beat, you won't gain its bonus. This sword might seem like a bit of a meme at first, but when fully powered up, I'm convinced it might be the best melee weapon in the game. The Spectrum Dance Saber, as it's called, is quite hard to get. You'll first have to complete an elaborate collectible quest to unlock it, and even then it'll set you back 16,500 bits , making it by far the most expensive weapon I've found in the game. Even after unscrupulously looting my way across the first few regions, this still put a serious dent in my hoard of bits.

PC Gamer features producer Mollie Taylor was among that player count earlier this week, and in her impressions said \"things are a little janky right now\" but \"the whole thing is darn fun.\" It's a physics-based adventure game where a bunch of pudgy dads haul a camper through perilous crags with a remote-operated winch, avoid getting eaten by bears, and exhale enough cigarette smoke to conceal a marching army. It's released to warm reception on Steam, with user reviews stabilizing at a \"Very Positive\" rating. The store page's top-rated review , by user LeGrandOptimist, reads \"Fix RV. Smoke cig.

The culprit was a software bug in DynamoDB, AWS' DNS management system. DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems. On the modern internet, many services, such as cloud computing or streaming, need to be able to assign the same domain to multiple IP addresses in a network, allowing efficient use of geographically distributed servers.

In fact, it's been \"pretty fucking great.\" In an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens , Andersson said the DLC model has been a logistical and financial win. \"When we started with that system, we were a studio of 12 people. That's [around the time Crusader Kings 2 released] and we're doing EU4.

In 2010, before League of Legends and Dota 2 had become the esports institutions they are now, there was Heroes of Newerth. Before it shut down in 2022 , it was a relic of a time when MOBAs hadn't really proved their staying power yet; and now, somehow, it's back. First announced nine months ago , Heroes of Newerth: Reborn is a relaunch-slash-remaster of the defunct MOBA. A trailer dropped Wednesday announcing a free open beta starting on Nov. 11, and it certainly looks like HoN. While League of Legends was a fully original game with its own heroes and items, HoN was much closer to DotA (albeit with a trashier sense of humor). In May 2010, Dota was still just an old Warcraft 3 mod, so HoN had its niche among players who didn't like League's snappier, skill shot-oriented action. All this makes the re-release sort of a headscratcher for any outside of Newerth's niche fanbase. If you long to play Dota, it's one of the biggest games on Steam—a platform Reborn is completely forgoing in favor of Juvio. If you're wonde…",

Still, the strangest helmet I've come across in my travels through outer space is by far A New Point of View Mk 2. This fancy dome-protector is relatively tough to acquire and you'll miss it entirely (along with a bunch of other strange gear) if you don't complete a specific collectible quest.

In the 2010s, when Telltale started releasing all of its games episodically, it was novel. It was also before streamers took over TV and dumped entire seasons on us instantly. Now the streamers have started to go back to traditional release schedules, but it still seemed wrong to have to wait to enjoy more of a game. It's finished. It's ready.

The team was so heads-down invested in first-person melee they were literally unaware of their surroundings. \"We were working on the hit effects on staggers and animations, a team deeply into the melee system,\" says chief creative officer Anders De Geer. \"We all had a meeting and we talked about it, and then we went to lunch, and around the lunch table we continued talking, how it should feel and how enemies should react. We talked a lot about hitting people in the head with axes and stuff. And then at one point, I looked up and I realized that everyone else was just looking at us. 'Who are these lunatics?'

Sometimes there's a bunch of different dirty surfaces close together, and then I get several dings in quick succession. It's riveting stuff. That was a thing in the first game, but PowerWash Simulator 2 adds a big, circular surface cleaner, the Swirlforce Surf Ace, for maximum good job dings on flat surfaces. It's all the satisfaction and thrill of getting a new kitchen appliance as an adult, but instead of shoving it into a cabinet and forgetting it, I'm driving all over town and looking for excuses to use it.

Nearly 20,000 games released on Steam last year alone, and we're picking from the entire history of the medium (albeit with a particular focus on games we recommend to today's audience).

Our selection changes substantially year-to-year as the PC Gamer team grows, tastes change, and classics are reevaluated. In 2012, Skyrim was #1. This year, it didn't make the cut at all.
