I'm here to solve the disappearance of Evelyn Deane, a woman the hotel manager insists isn't missing at all and most of the guests have a strong, and often not particularly positive, opinion of. To do this I've got to cautiously listen at doors before sneaking inside using stolen keys, eavesdrop on conversations held in quiet corners, and piece this puzzle together using clues found amongst crumpled up letters, half-burnt notes, and polite conversations at dinner. This is classic murder mystery stuff—and also where adventure games can quickly lose grip of their own plot. But The Seance of Blake Man…",

Considering I'm level 20 and already prepping an expedition to send off my Raider to a nice farm upstate, you can take my word for it that this place is extremely lucrative. And the best part? It's on the outskirts of the Buried City rather than the highly contested centre of the town, it's close to a Raider Hatch and a subway station for fast exfil, and it doesn't require a key, or fighting past a load of Arc enemies to access it. A little oasis in the apocalypse. Weirdly, all you have to do is breach a single door and step into a small room with four lootable containers. The loot spot is behind a breachable door on the north side of the platform at Marano Station (Image credit: Embark Studios) So where is this golden loot spot: Marano Station . You'll have to head here for the Market Correction quest, but otherwise, it's a pretty uninhabited area of the map, a little ways off to the side of the Marano Park in the north where the Bastion likes…",

Demonstrating his utter wrongness yet again is the Emulated Vintage Gaming YouTube channel, which recently posted a 10 hour long video of a lore-accurate recreation of Frodo's epic journey from Bag End to Mordor in Lord of the Rings Online . 'Frodo walks from the Shire to Mordor,' as it's called, is not as dramatic or exciting as Peter Jackson's famed film trilogy: It is literally a recording of Frodo walking— walking , take note, not running, although he does get to ride here and there when the books say so—along the route originally followed by the Fellowship. At various spots along the way, Andy Serkis chimes in to describe the scene via audio clips taken from the Lord of the Rings audiobooks, which as chosen line up remarkably well with the events happening on screen. But even though it lacks the cinematic oomph of an Oscar-winning Hollywood film trilogy, the video is an undeniably impressive undertaking, and I dropped a line to EVG to ask what inspired him to do such a thing. \"Escapism, mainly,\" the channel owner, who asked to go unnamed, replied. \"Like anyone …",

Dwarves, meanwhile, received new toys to stem the tide of besieging goblins, like autocrossbow turret emplacements and metal-fortified walls. Overnight, the fantasy settlement sim has rewritten decades of player defensive strategy. One of the interesting complications added by the Siege Update, however, is an unintentional one. Shortly after the update went live, players started reporting on the Kitfox Games Discord that, inexplicably, dwarves in their forts were dying of starvation and dehydration. And not just any dwarves: The moms were refusing to eat, and their babies were the culprit. (Image credit: Kitfox Games) The problem, you see, is that moms are like horses—in Dwarf Fortress, at least. In DF, mothers always hold their newborn babies until the infants reach an age where they can walk, play, and feed themselves. To achieve that, the game actually uses the same systems that let soldiers ride war mounts: While we're shown a dwarven mo…",

Battlefield 6 managed a massive 747,000 concurrent players earlier in the month, off the back of a mostly-well-received launch. Of course, there's no one single reason why both of these games attracted so many players to their respective worlds. Battlefield 6 is the latest entry in a long and storied series, whereas Arc Raiders has taken the extraction shooter formula and refined it down to an easy to learn, hard to master point, to name just two. But I'll tell you one thing I think has made a major difference to those player uptake numbers—low hardware requirements. Sure, there have been some highly demanding successful releases this year, like Borderlands 4 , Oblivion Remastered , and Assassin's Creed Shadows .…",

But does Steam's dominance of the PC gaming market constitute a monopoly? Well, according to a new whitepaper, most game developers think so. Titled 'The State of PC Game Distribution' (via GamesIndustry ), the paper concludes that 72% of game developers believe the platform has a monopoly on the PC games market. The whitepaper was published by the digital distribution platform Rokky . If you're wondering \"who the heck is Rokky?\" then it's a new distribution platform that aims to connect publishers with various digital storefronts around the globe. The whitepaper was based on an independent study conducted by Atomik Research, which surveyed 306 executives in the UK and US between May 18 and May 22 this year.

The question is, of course, at what point does lower latency become undetectable to human senses? According to MCHOSE itself, the 16 kHz version of the Ace 68 Turbo only improves latency over the (presumably cheaper) 8 KHz variant by 0.02 ms, with the Turbo sitting at 0.06 ms rather than 0.08 ms. So, we are talking about hundredths of a millisecond. Can anyone actually feel that? Cue an army of twitch gamers pointing out the huge benefits of 8 kHz mice and how they couldn't possibly slum it with—eugh!—a 4 KHz rodent. Or whatever. Likewise, it wasn't that long ago that the idea of a, say, 500 Hz monitor seemed a bit silly. Surely anything beyond about 240 Hz was beyond human perception? Well, that no longer seems to be the case. And yet, I'd still take some convincing that there's real-world benefit in a 16 kHz keeb.…",

It was Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, who made the point about insufficient power in a 70-minute interview (via Tom's Hardware ) with YouTube channel Bg2 Pod, alongside OpenAI's boss, Sam Altman. It came about when the interview's host, Brad Gerstner, mentioned that Nvidia's Jen-Hsun Huang had said that there was almost zero chance of there being a 'compute glut' within the next couple of years (and by that, he means an excess of AI GPUs). \"The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it’s power,\" replied Nadella. \"It’s sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power.

Exactly one dozen civilizations are getting a rework, namely Aksum, Chola, Egypt, Great Britain, Hawaii, Maya, Mississippian, Prussia, Qing, Songhai, Spain, and finally, Persia, which has been renamed slightly to differentiate it from a new DLC Civ. While the changes vary slightly between civs, the general thrust is the same. \"The majority of these adjustments are significant buffs aimed at strengthening these fan-favourite Civs,\" Beach explains. \"We're also introducing more specific bonuses to help each Civ lean into a unique playstyle.\" One example is that Egypt now receives \"tailored\" bonuses for building settlements and districts alongside river tiles.

Internet Archive might be most well known for its website archiver, The Wayback Machine, but, in 2020, its Open Library was sued by four major book publishers. Effectively, the Open Library is a digital library, where the Internet Archive would 'loan' digital versions of physical books it owns, to emulate a library. These books would be lent at a 1-1 rate with what it owned. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it created the National Emergency Library in response to libraries shutting down, which removed its prior lending restrictions. In June last year , Hatchet, HarperCollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House won their suit against Internet Archive's Open Library, taking out 500,000 books from the library.

This handheld is extraordinary by several measures. First up, it's absolutely massive. The screen is 11 inches.

The upshot of which is that the Abxylute 3D One pretty much dwarfs the laptop on which I'm typing these words.

The European Space Agency (ESA) deorbited its OPS-SAT device back in May 2024, but before it was turned into dust motes, Georges Labrèche (engineering manager at ESA) contacted Ólafur Waage, a Norwegian software engineer , to see if he fancied a little challenge. Waage is no random coder, though, as he's a highly experienced game developer , working for Massive Entertainment—makers of Far Cry 6, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, and countless others. The challenge was simple on paper: port Doom to run on OPS-SAT. This satellite was an experiment by the ESA, which could be used by members of the public directly over the Internet.

Then a developer comes crashing in with an apology over a piece of official art where a small group of gamers have convinced themselves that it's some kind of radical feminist propaganda. That's what's happened in the case of South Korean developer ShiftUp, anyhow. As reported by Automaton , the studio behind Stellar Blade and Nikke: Goddess of Victory found itself in hot water back in August over the latter game when it shared a piece of art commemorating the gacha's 1,000th day since launching in November 2022. (Image credit: ShiftUp Corporation) It's a cute piece of art, showcasing the Counters squad with Anis, Neon, and Rapi delivering a cake and presents. To someone like me, it's completely unassuming. To others, though, it was apparently a gigantic red flag of misandry. That's thanks to the finger positions of Anis and Rapi, with some Korean players accusing the art of being a secret \"jibgeson\" or \"crab hand\" drawing.

By nature of it being an extraction shooter, however, it's not a matter of simply equipping the best gun in your loadout and venturing out topside. No, you'll have to find, craft, or buy higher-quality weapons. That takes time, and you can always lose them in a matter of seconds. With that in mind, below, I'll recommend the best weapons for each 'stage' of Arc Raiders, beginning with the strongest cheap weapons, and moving all the way up to the rarest, which aren't necessarily the best in all situations. Generally, if you lose a shootout against other players, it's probably more so down to your strategy and positioning than your gear, as most high-end guns are designed to improve versatility or handling over pure DPS.

Instead, they've been burning the midnight oil, supplementing their energy with cans of sugary Pop Snarkle and nourishing alien soup. The result is a beefy new update for Abiotic Factor that adds whole new ways to enjoy and/or suffer through its Half-Life-inspired science maze. Primarily, the 1.1 update adds two new modes—Hardcore mode and Iron mode. Hardcore Mode is, frankly, ridiculous, forcing Abiotic Factor's 'Apocalyptic' difficulty setting with the added challenge of losing everything if you die. Progress can be reset by server admins should they deem it necessary, but Deep Field stresses \"that is the cowar…",

There's an overwhelming amount of content you can spend your coins on, like adding a larger variety of animals and fish to the game, or even dinosaurs if you fancy re-creating your own Jurassic Park. But you can also add new, horrifying mobs to the game, different animations, and a number of new blocks created by other players which all alter the core Minecraft experience in one way or another. However, the most popular add-on currently available on the Marketplace doesn't add terrors or a huge variety of wildlife to the game. Instead, it focuses on one thing and one thing only: owls . Obviously everyone loves Minecraft's existing mob selection, but I can't lie, I do find myself getting a bit bored of seeing nothing but pigs, chickens, cows, and sheep. That said, I still get incredibly excited on the odd occasion I stumble across a fox, so I can understand why so many people have jumped at the opportunity to add an all-new creature to the game.

But what is the most satisfying weapon in gaming history? That's an interesting question, and one that when asked by Apogee Entertainment's X account, was answered by none other than the grandfather of FPS games, John Romero, he of Doom fame. Super Shotgun. https://t.co/TikpaEHwhr November 3, 2025 Romero's response was the objectively correct one in my opinion, too, with Romero voting for the 'Super Shotgun', as introduced to gaming originally in Doom 2. Many other gamers agreed with the FPS legend, with comments replying with sentiments such as, 'Agreed! Double barrel in Doom 2', as well as 'it's a scientific fact' and 'it's the Super Shotgun for me too'. One reply simply states, 'I strongly agree, Mr Romero'. How polite.

    "body": "So I'm minding your own business in Arc Raiders when suddenly, 'crack, pszzt!' Another player decided to use my body for target practice, and now my shield's busted and HP is low. How do I react? Immediately pop a shield recharger of course. Then I take one more shot to the body and die. Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.

Arc Raiders hit a new high in concurrent Steam players on Sunday, falling just shy of 355,000 people playing all at the same time. That's very good indeed—what's less good is that 355,000 people playing all at the same time put a little extra strain on the game's servers, and there was, as Embark put it, a wobble . Reports of Arc Raiders server issues began popping up on Reddit in the early afternoon (Eastern time) on November 2, as eager players ran headlong into login and matchmaking issues. The cause of the outage was no great mystery: WE PEAKED AND NOW THE ARC BROKE THE SERVERS! from r/ArcRaiders Evidence of the servers struggle can be seen on SteamDB , where a high of nearly 338,000 concurrent players was achieved before sudden palpitations threw everything into disarray. It doesn't appear that the game was down completely, nor does it seem the troubles lasted for very long. Up, up, up, whoa whoa whoops!

    "body": "Memory has been in a weird spot as of late. The increased demands presented by the rise of AI , plus the expansion of data centres, stock shortages, and the winding down of DDR4 have all left the typical gamer caught out in the rain. Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board. This unwillingness to lock in prices is likely linked to the sudden demand/memory shortage, and Digitimes reports that Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are all likely …",

It's surprising, not just considering the fact that Nvidia is the first company in the world to reach a $5 trillion valuation , but also company CEO Jensen Huang's recent comments that the US needs to \"go compete\" with its AI chips in China.
