Or punishment cutscene, depending on how you feel about the whole thing. As showcased by YouTuber Cuttyflame , successfully skipping \"around 30\" or so of the game's cutscenes—harder than it sounds: skipping cutscenes requires passing an ever-more-complex series of minigames—will eventually lead protagonist Nate to straightforwardly give up on trying to act out cutscenes towards the game's end. Rather than, you know, do a proper cutscene, Nate and chill donkey-guy Moose will acknowledge the player's lack of interest in their narrative, sit down, drop character, and embark on a cutscene that puts even Kojima to shame.

For context: In the Borderlands 4 post-game, there's a vendor called Maurice's Black Market , a vending machine that changes location every week and sells a number of legendaries that are rolled on a per-player basis. However, a recent patch introduced a bug that meant players in co-op games couldn't interact with the Maurice machines in their friends' worlds. It's a so-so system—it can be disappointing to rush to your own personal Maurice box, only to find out that none of the rolls are useful—but Pitchford does make a solid argument that this system lets communities band together to share their rolls and pick a buddy to skim good legendary weapons off. But, like, in gamer vernacular. \"Bro\", Pitchford writes, \"Get in a group of people who post their rolls every week and jump into each other’s …",

    "body": "Painfully high graphics card pricing has become a seemingly permanent norm and at least some of that comes down to the impact of the burgeoning AI boom. Are SSD and system memory prices poised to go the same way? According to analysis by Tom's Hardware , the unfortunate answer is yes. Tom's claims that, \"nearly every analyst firm and memory maker is now warning of looming NAND and DRAM shortages that will send SSD and memory prices skyrocketing over the coming months and years, with some even predicting a shortage that will last a decade.\" The reason, inevitably, is explosive demand for AI hardware. Tom's notes that there's some of the usual cyclical variation going on here. Following a downturn in demand in 2022 and 2023 that saw DRAM and NAND memory manufacturers selling chips below cost, manufacturing volumes were scaled back, which eventually fed through into higher prices. But more recently, the insatiable demands of AI for training and inference is requiring vast amounts of storage and memory. One AI outfit alone, OpenAI, has signed a deal with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which could account for 40% of current global DRAM output . Meanwhile,…",

    "body": "For the first time since switching to an annual expansion cycle, Guild Wars 2's next release will introduce a new set of elite specializations for each of the game's nine classes—or professions, as they're called in-game. Elite specs are a pretty big deal—making fundamental changes to how a profession plays. New traits, utility skills and an overhaul of the base profession mechanic means entire new builds for players to try. \"We definitely figured out that we wanted to do elite specs pretty early,\" says Cal Cohen, senior game designer for Guild Wars 2, in an interview with PC Gamer. Previous annual expansions have focused on adding new weapon options for each profession, which Cohen notes are \"a lot more specific\" in what they can do for a profession's kit. New elite specs, meanwhile, give ArenaNet a lot more options in what they can pursue. \"When we look at elite specializations, we really try to shift the profession mechanic into something more radical … so that the gameplay is significantly changed. And usually elite specs can also fill a couple of different roles. So whenever we can do elite specs, I think we want to do elite specs.\" The new set of elite specs, which are launc…",

My credentials? Well, I've had the fortune—or misfortune, if you will—to've been playing MMOs for most of my life, and I will be playing them until they no longer exist or until I am dead. In other words? I'm Terminally Online. I've noticed a recent trend—I say recent, more a slow slide taking place over the past decade—of MMORPGs doing away with the casual/hardcore split. See, in the olden days, there were the tryhards and the try-nots. The elite and the n00bs. The sweats and the… dry people. I'm not sure what the opposite of a sweat is. MMOs have classically been large, open worlds that you could futz around forever in. But if you wanted to see every inch of them, you had to work.

This will be the final patch for Millennia, thanks to C Prompt for their work and support of this game. We at Paradox will no longer be active on community platforms for Millennia, but you can continue counting on us for support needs, and the game will remain available to play indefinitely.\" That announcement highlights …",

She then entered the industry as a professional, starting a long and far-reaching career.

I can't even remember the exact circumstances that led me to put 50 hours into a game I'd never heard of before, but its characters, combat, and academic structure really resonated with me. Since then I've come to the conclusion that everyone is secretly a JRPG fan—it's just about finding the right one at the right time in your life. Over the subsequent years I played all four of the Trails of Cold Steel PC ports as they were released, but it always rankled with me that if I wanted to go back to the start of the series (five games earlier) and experience the story from the beginning, I'd have to play a 21-year-old game. There is a 2014 PC port of the original Trails in the Sky , but I'd be losing out on all the combat features added over the years, a whole heap of QoL, and would have to deal with the perspective shift from full 3D to that classic chibi-sprite isometric look that older JRPGs favour. Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter has now been remade, thank the gods, and having spent a week playing the whole thing I can say…",

One scripted, one very-much-not, but two watershed moments in open-world games this decade. Now, as we slouch slowly but surely towards GTA 6 (on console, at least; a PC launch date still lingers in the ether) and the promise of whatever shape its own online offshoot might take, the idea of balancing the invented with the inadvertent excites me to no end. With that in mind, low-key Rockstar partnerships dance at the forefront of my imagination. Wheels of steel (Image credit: Rockstar/Traderrjoe) You see, no matter how well-executed Rockstar's blockbuster GTA Online updates have been in more recent years, there's something brilliant about its most unhinged but unplanned moments on the streets of San Andreas.

But unlike your usual old-school music discovery methods—the radio, bargain bin CDs, listening to your pal's MP3 player—the way I stumbled across what is now one of my favourite bands is a little strange. I actually first heard Hayley Williams warbling in The Sims' nonsense language, Simlish. It first made an appearance in the console version of The Sims 2, and I was hooked from the very first radio play. It took me some time to realise that Pressure and Paramore was a real song performed by a real artist—listen, I was a child, and a bit of a stupid one at that—but Simlish renditions of real-world songs have since become an integral part of The Sims experience. Sure, you could probably just add the songs in English and be done with it, but The Sims intentionally avoided using real languages in the game for a reason. S…",

Alongside the bosses, the stony shores are prowled by new Ichthian creatures to fight, such as the Ketos Spawn and \"shark-like Bruisers\" led by powerful commanders.

Best of all, I don't have to deal with *shudder* other people beyond the occasional email and phone call. That said, I'm aware that it's good to go outside once in a while. So I understand the motivation behind Rust 's latest update, which aims to shake up the meta to encourage players to stop loafing around in their houses and get back to the office—the office in this case being abandoned monuments to civilization where players can horribly murder one another. \"The current progression meta has grown stale, moving too fast and becoming too easy over the years,\" Facepunch writes in a Steam post , citing the abundance of the scrap resource as a cause. \"We don't believe this has been overwhelmingly negative, but it has detracted from world PvP, especially in and around monuments.\" To counter this, Facepunch is implementing a \"new layer of progression to the workbench system\".

Yet while updates remained relatively consistent through last year, 2025 has been much more sporadic, with no updates in the last nine months. That's changed now, however, as Slavic Magic has finally released a new experimental beta for Manor Lords, one that brings an impressive array of new features to the city-builder. The beta patch expands the scope of Manor Lords in several directions. It adds four new maps that can be played in two additional game modes—1v1 Duel and a four-way free-for-all called Fractured Realm. It also adds a new masonry-themed production chain that lets players fashion stone and mortar through building a quarry, stonemason and lime kiln.

Now, though, it won't be long until 3D Realms' 1996 shooter fully embraces length, breadth and depth, thanks to one intrepid modder utterly obsessed with voxels. Said modder is Dan Peterson , who goes by the monicker Cheello, a game developer specialising in voxel tech who spends his spare time bulking out classic 90s shooters using the pixel's three-dimensional equivalent. Peterson's first project was Blood: Coagulated , which replaces the enemies and objects of Monolith's 1997 shooter with fatter, voxel-based versions. But Peterson is best known for his 2022 mod Voxel Doom , which brought us chunky pinkies, beefier hellknights, and truly round Cacodemons. Now, Peterson has revealed Voxel Duke Nukem 3D, debuting the project in a trailer on YouTube. \"All monsters, babes, props and more have been fully converted to 3D voxel models.\" Peterson writes in the trailer description. \"Blast your way th…",

The behind-the-scenes online matchmaking practice, which seeks to pair players with those of a similar skill level, has grown controversial among some competitive FPS fans, and this is the first time Activision has ceded any ground on the issue. \"Like all things in Beta, our collective goal is to gather critical in-game data and feedback to make Black Ops 7 the best experience possible,\" Activision wrote in the patch notes. \"We’re engaging with the community discussion about matchmaking and will be making some updates to our playlist plans.\" For today, October 4, the beta will have two playlists for players to queue in⁠—Moshpit and Open Moshpit⁠—both with the same maps and modes. \"In Open Moshpit, skill consideration is drastically reduced when matchmaking, with the goal of providing more varied match experiences and outcomes,\" the patch notes continue. \"This playlist will match players with and against players of more varied skill differences than in the current Multiplayer matchmaking system.\" The primary critique of SB…",

The game's planned system of robot prostheses for when this sort of thing happens has not been implemented yet, and more to the point, the arena gates would only open when one man was left standing. I had one potential recourse: An incredibly satisfying kick attack that ragdolls enemies and sends them flying, a perfect pairing with the instant death spike wall in one corner of the arena. Unfortunately, night had fallen, bathing everything outside a ring of torches in impenetrable darkness. I wish I could say I rose to the occasion and blind-launched this miniboss into the spikes, but the run ended in failure. I was better prepared next time, bringing a torch to set on the ground beside the spikes, letting me lure the knight to his death before he could land a single attack.

Created by modder therealsqueam, the simply titled Witcher—Moveset Mod lets you get your Geralt on in The Lands Between by adding a full fighting style inspired by Andrzej Sapkowski's monster hunters into the game. It also adds the ability to cast signs, and even incorporates Geralt-style fisticuffs just in case you're caught without your weapon drawn. Chiefly, the mod replaces Milady and Leda's swords with blades of steel and silver, typically wielded by Witchers, both of which can be purchased from Merchant Kalé in Limgrave. The steel sword naturally scales with dexterity, while the silver sword dishes out big holy damage, making it ideal for dealing with undead creatures.

Plus, like a certain Duke who gave his name to a certain rubber footwear, it also gives Napoleon a proper sorting out. Map generation is the primary target of update 1.2.5, with Firaxis responding to complaints that the sequel's landmasses were predictable and dull. To fix the issue, Firaxis says it has \"started from scratch and created a new base algorithm for making maps\" in Civ, while simultaneously introducing two extra map types. \"Continents and Islands\" serves as the new map default for single-player, mixing up larger and smaller landmasses of various sizes, while \"Pangaea and Islands\" situates the bulk of the action on one giant geographical inkblot, with splashes of separate terrain in and around it.

The big change to perks this year is the addition of hybrid specialities, alternative bonuses to the three main combat specialities that let you mix and match perk types a bit. There are also more perks at launch than last year (27 vs 21) and some existing ones have moved around tiers, but if you got comfortable with perk combinations in Blops 6, most of them will still work the same in Blops 7. There are three perk types: Offense (red), Stealth (Blue), and Support (Green).
