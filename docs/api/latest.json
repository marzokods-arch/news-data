First revealed back in August , Title Update 3 will add Eorzea-themed hunts, equipment, and cosmetics, which—while appreciated—still leaves Wilds' glaring performance issues largely unaddressed. The headlining addition in TU3 is Omega Planetes, the FF14 incarnation of Final Fantasy's recurring mechanical superboss who's somehow managed to hop dimensions into the Monster Hunter setting. Considering Omega is a superweapon whose prime directive is dragon killing, its presence presumably doesn't bode well for Monster Hunter's largely lizard-based ecology, so it's up to the hunters to boot it back to its proper reality. Omega Planetes descends upon the Forbidden Lands in Free Title Update 3, heralding the arrival of the Monster Hunter Wilds x FINAL FANTASY XIV Online Special Collaboration!@FF_XIV_EN Themed weapons, armor, cosmetics, special actions and more await you from September 29! pic.twitter.com/lBrAPH0Y6s September 24, 2025 Like the Behemoth crossover hunt from Monster Hunter: Wo…",

It works by analyzing acoustic features like phonemes and intonation to create a stream of animation data, which is then mapped to a character's facial poses.

FiveM enables the use of custom cars, maps, and weapons among other content, but crucially also allows for a much bigger player count in online games. Together, these capabilities made it a key piece of software for GTA Online's roleplay (RP) community. At the time, fans hoped this heralded a bright new era for GTA RP. Then it all went quiet. But finally we're starting to see the fruits of that acquisition, and Rockstar itself is helping to promote it. \"Nopixel V is the next evolution of the GTAV Roleplay experience, created in collaboration with Rockstar Games,\" said the X announcement . \"Coming soon to the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms—stay tuned for more information at nopixel.net .\" \"We’re excited to support the nopixel team as they create the future of GTA RP,\" said Rockstar , retweeting the above. What exactly Rockstar's support means is left ambiguous, but having nopixel V running through the Rockstar launcher feels huge.

The idea, apparently, is to fuse \"mobile and PC\" into a single device. And given Qualcomm is part of this particular conversation, that device would presumably be running an Arm chip rather than a traditional x86 PC processor. The venue for all this is Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 , where Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon had an on-stage conversation with Google SVP of Platforms & Devices Rick Osterloh. Google said last year that it planned to base ChromeOS on Android in future, as opposed to being its own stand-alone OS. At the summit, the pair fleshed out some of the details. \"In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,\" Osterloh said. That has meant, for instance, that running Android apps on a ChromeOS device required a virtual machine. But ChromeOS will now be a part of the overall Android stack. \"We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems. \"This is …",

Instead of hooking up its new order of Supermicro-built Nvidia GB300 NVL72 racks to the local electrical grid and water supply, Lambda had them installed at ECL's facility in Mountain View , California.

Seeing the before and after pictures next to one another, it's clear how much was lost to the fog, aesthetically speaking. (Image credit: Konami / Fellow_Demo) The images with no fog look brilliant. The town looks much more vibrant, which really helps you appreciate the quality of the graphics. It also strips away any eeriness and actually makes it look like a lovely, normal town that I'd love to visit, as long as none of the monsters are still lurking around. It's a fun mod to see out so soon, but in all honesty, I don't think there's much need to tone down the fog for those who aren't just interested in sightseeing—you can see everything you need to with it there just fine.

Currently, 69% (nice) of all reviews in the last 30 days are positive. Well, Arrowhead has noticed your concerns. In a recent post to the Helldivers 2 Discord, community manager Baskinator relays: \"We know many of you have been experiencing issues, including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs. \"We’ve seen the feedback across Discord, forums, Reddit and our dashboards. You’ve been loud, clear, and absolutely right to expect better. We also recognise that our recent updates haven’t hit the mark, and our silence hasn’t helped. That’s on us.

In Persian, this is called 'taarof' and can take the form of multiple polite refusals in response to, say, a host's offer of food.

      "body": "If you think the power consumption of today's gaming graphics cards is bad, it's nothing compared to how energy the massive processors in AI and data systems use. All that power ends up as heat, resulting in chip cooling being a serious challenge. Microsoft reckons it has a great solution, though, and it's all about getting water into the processors themselves. The most complex direct-die, liquid cooling loops you'll see in a gaming PC all involve using a chamber that mounts on top of the CPU. At no point does the coolant ever touch the chip directly. In a recently published blog, Microsoft explains how it has developed a system that does precisely that. By etching the surface of the processor die with an intricate pattern of tiny channels, water can then be pumped directly into the silicon itself, albeit to a very shallow depth. The keyword to describe this is microfluidics , a technology that's been around for many decades, and if the history of consumer tech is anything to go by, it'll be a phrase plastered across every CPU cooler within a couple of years (though not actually do anything). This might all just seem like Microsoft is cutting a few grooves into the chip and having…",

A quick primer before we get into the functionality. Both CS:GO and CS2 award their players weapon skins or cases for hitting various in-game milestones. The way they've been awarded has changed over time, and the game's added additional cosmetics like graffiti, but these gun skins are the bedrock of a vast marketplace, the true size of which is unknown. And yeah: the ones you get just for playing can look nice, but generally hold little value, while the finishes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars are almost exclusively found in weapon crates (unlocked with a case key that costs $2.50). Weapon crates are pure RNG, and have their share of critics: some would say that the upfront cost and unknown outcome make them gambling. The new Genesis Uplink Terminal seems like a respon…",

      "body": "Portable PC gaming has never been such great value. Sure, the original LCD Deck is over three years old. Even at launch, it was no powerhouse. But that's the point. The Deck was never about performance flexing. It's about simpler, purer gaming fun and now you can get that for less cash than ever before. Nice. Key specs: 7-inch LCD | 1,280 x 800 | 60 Hz | 256 GB | 40 Whr battery | 45 W power supply View Deal In an age where a budget graphics card costs 400 bucks, the fact that you can get an entire gaming rig—and a portable one, at that—for something around the 300 mark has to be celebrated. So, let's give it up for the new price-reduced Steam Deck, yours for just $319.20 or £279.20 from the official Valve store . The Steam Deck was first released in 2022 and it is, unsurprisingly, the original LCD-screened model with the now entry-level 256 GB of storage that's had a 20% price haircut and therefore not the revised and improved OLED model . Join us on WhatsApp for daily deals , direct to your phone. However, the original Deck still has plenty going for it , especially when you consider that the OLED one isn't meaningfully faster in terms of game performance. Indeed, it wasn't meant…",

That's probably not information you care to fill your brain up with right now, but you might need to know it at some point soon as the latest games begin to require it to keep cheaters away. Secure Boot is a security feature within the UEFI and used for signing Kernel-level code that runs on your PC to ensure it's not, er, dodgy. The idea is, if everyone agrees to sign their code using cryptographic keys, an OS and its apps can be more confident that malicious software is not running in the background, such as a rootkit or low-level cheat software. Game developers are increasingly turning to Secure Boot to ensure their anti-cheat software isn't bypassed. Battlefield 6 has become somewhat infamous for requiring Secure Boot, through EA's Javelin anti-cheat software, though Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat and Riot's Vanguard also require it. Secure Boot will be required to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, too. The flipside is, there are a good deal of people that don't trust various game developers to have kernel-level access for their anti-cheat applications. The kernel is the most privileged part of you…",

This is especially true when it comes to frame generation, as Intel has a system that's better than AMD's, even though it's far behind in discrete GPU sales. And if the naming of some software configuration code is anything to go by, Intel might even have something planned to put its frame gen tech on par with Nvidia's. The code in question is an 'extensible application markup language' file that Intel uses to configure how its Graphics Software app. It basically determines which menus, options, etc, get shown for whatever Arc graphics cards or iGPU you have in your PC. Sharp-eyed Redditor Organic-Bird-587 noticed something distinctly unusual in the wording of one section. (Image credit: Intel) You can see the heading for the code section clearly states 'Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)', and the reason why this is noteworthy is because Intel's current implementation of XeSS Frame Generation isn't 'multi' at all; the algorithm only creates a single frame, just like AMD's system does.

Thanks for the slip up, Amazon. We already knew that Nioh 3 would be getting a simultaneous release on PC and PS5, so no more waiting around for us this time, but now we know when to expect it: February 6, 2026, which fits the \"early 2026\" window we were given previously. Before Amazon corrected its mistake, the release date could be seen on the listings for both the standard and Treasure Box editions, along with the first reveal of the PS5 box art. Sony's next State of Play airs during the Tokyo Game Show today, which seems like a more appropriate place to announce the release date, so it seems like Amazon Japan just jumped the gun. I'm pretty excited for this one. Nioh 2 is up there with the best of FromSoftware's fare, but like the greatest soulslikes, it's not content to simply ape a competitor's games. The varied weapon stances, ki system, transformations and randomised loot sets it apart, and, frankly, it's considerably trickier.

So, having ways to pass the time while you wait for someone to make a cup of tea, eat their dinner, or return from the heavy fog they've somehow disappeared into in the time it took for them to reply to a message and join the game, is essential. However, the opportunities to pass time in the airport before you set off on your climbing adventure in Peak are incredibly limited. Or at least they were until now. You have a climbing wall, and aside from running up and down the travelator, you're stuck for any activities really. Luckily, the \"Dillydally mini-update\" has rolled out, adding two new games to the airport to keep you entertained until it's time to head off.

The previous card also has a cat girl, but a hole in the rear plate of the GPU gets in the way of the image, which means the new card will get you a smidge more cat girl, should you care a lot about cat girl economics.

Since this is a \"walking simulator\" and this logic applies to real life too, it may seem overly obvious. And it might be. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I know I'm not alone in that. Baby Steps is played from a third-person perspective and it lets you change whether the camera is oriented to the left or right of Nate. But during the trickier traversal scenarios, such as when you're navigating a very narrow bridge or even something as thin as a tightrope, I found that it was basically essential to train that camera on Nate's feet via a top -down perspective. Just seeing Nate's legs is not enough! Just like this (thanks to Morgan Park for the video): In other words, don't just let the camera languish on Nate's butt. Move it around, but especially move it up. The physics in Baby Steps are detailed and fun to mess with, but even when you're just walking along seemingly safe surfaces, a simple obscurely placed rock can send you tumbling.

The only paths back up involved even tricker rocks, and predictably I fell again, tumbling off the grassy ledge to land next to a mudslide. Fortunately there was a dry path beside the mud, and unfortunately I found a single rock on that path, tripped, hit the mudslide, and slid to the bottom of it. Walking back up that path I managed to slip into the mud twice more, the second time achieving such slippery velocity I flung myself back to a previous biome, landing in a lake.

I'm sure I'll watch the movie out of curiosity (or because my boss makes me review it) but it does feel like it's arriving about a decade too late. That's because it's arriving about a decade too late. The Watch Dogs movie was announced back in 2013, the same year as the Harlem Shake, and Beyonce lip-syncing at Obama's first inauguration, and the Game of Thrones show's Red Wedding. That's how damn long ago this movie was announced . More perspective: 2013 was the year Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag came out. Ubisoft has released eight more Assassin's Creed games since the Watch Dogs movie was greenlit. So, yeah, it took quite a while to get rolling, but last year we got confirmation that filming was actually underway , and we've now gotten confirmation that filming has wrapped (at least mostly) and we may actually get to see this gosh darn movie at some point before we're planted.

Ultrakill is fast-paced, bloody, and constructed around five weapons and the intricate way their various fire modes can be comboed together. It also boasts the brilliant tagline: \"Mankind is dead. Blood is fuel. Hell is full.\" The announcement says that \"collaboration gear and weapons from the cult-hit game Ultrakill are coming to Palworld!\" Ultrakill's hardware is fantastic, and you'd expect there'll be some clever ways to get all your pals tooled-up and combo-ing merrily together.

Each death offers a lesson. Every run improves your skills.

Phoenix Point maintained the original's complexity, elevated the strategic side of things dramatically and gave us tactical battles built on a detailed physics simulation. Unfortunately, it was rife with bugs at launch, and probably didn't get the fair shake it deserved thanks to its status as an Epic exclusive. It would take another year for it to come to Steam. Gollop remembers it as a \"very difficult project\". \"We reached a really great big audience with that one,\" he tells us. \"It was a very difficult project to do. With crowdfunding, you make promises which you don't know if you're going to be able to deliver. And we obviously tried very hard. We had all these backer builds that came out once every two or three months. Progress towards the final game was getting slower, though, and the game is complex.

The team found that many users' \"AI companionship emerges unintentionally through functional use rather than deliberate seeking.\" That means that while a user may first begin using an AI chatbot to, say, redraft an email or research caselaw that doesn't exist , an attachment can form over the course of initially aromantic prompts. The full paper elaborates: \"Users consistently describe organic evolution from creative collaboration or problem-solving to unexpected emotional bonds, with some users progressing through conventional relationship milestones, including formal engagements and marriages.\" The research team's findings are drawn from a sample of \"1,506 posts collected between 2024 and 2025\" from the aforementioned 27,000+ strong subreddit.

It makes sense, therefore, to take a look at where we've come from and how the classic legacy of this keyboard lives on decades later. The Model M started out as a replacement for IBM's Model F keyboard that was previously bundled with its terminals. That became too expensive to produce, so IBM looked to replace it with a \"low cost, high volume\" alternative: the Model M. The first Model M (or then, the IBM Enhanced Keyboard) was the keyboard IBM threw in with its 3161 model terminal and, outside of the typewriter and industrial models, is the genesis for the keyboard in the mainstream with the features that have become ubiquitous elsewhere, most notably key placement for things like the Control and 'inverted T' arrow keys .

And hell, Epic was right: over 126,000 concurrent players flocked to it during its weekend stint, according to IGN , making it one of the most popular game modes on offer during that time. I suppose a lot of that's down to the hunger for something new—Blitz Royale found similar success when it first landed a couple weeks ago—though, for some, the reasons for playing are perhaps more sinister. That's because the entire basis of Delulu is dropping in solo and making use of proximity voice chat to team up with other players—and then potentially betraying them. Sounds kind of fun in practice but hey, this is the internet we're talking about. What's an open voice chat without having a slur or two hurled your way, eh?
