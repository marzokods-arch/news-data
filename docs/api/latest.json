      "body": "The rumours have been swirling for a while, before today brought a major industry announcement: EA has struck a $55 billion deal to go private in a Saudi-backed buyout. It's the biggest leveraged buyout in history, meaning that the new EA is instantly saddled with $20 billion of debt, and will face intense pressure to crank those profits. And it's also the latest step in the Saudi Arabian Investment Fund's mission to \"sportswash\" the brutal regime, by using its influence and ubiquity across entertainment industries to distract from some of the world's most appalling human rights abuses. As the crack team at PCG towers discussed the deal, one line stuck with me: \"I wouldn't want to be sitting in a BioWare chair right now.\" The vibes around one of the all-time great RPG studios have not been good in recent years, and the fairly decent Dragon Age: The Veilguard didn't persuade anyone that the studio is capable of surpassing contemporary greats like Baldur's Gate 3 or Disco Elysium. Early this year, the studio was apparently cut to the bone in a round of layoffs , though a new Mass Effect game remains in development. For now.

Publisher Reef Entertainment announced today that the planned October 31 release date has been bumped to November 26 , for a pretty simple reason: Global financial instability. \"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector's Editions,\" the publisher wrote. \"Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.\" The Terminator 2D: No Fate Collector's Edition is a pretty swanky package, with a Steelbook case and collector's tin, art book, flipbook, a \"premium metal paperweight,\" two cloth posters, a fake arcade token, and more.

Things didn't go so well for longtime GTA producer Leslie Benzies, whose studio Build A Rocket Boy released MindsEye earlier this year. That was a bit of a disaster, to the extent the developer immediately went through a round of layoffs . Another departure was Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar who left in 2020 to establish Absurd Ventures, which is so far living up to the name by releasing a graphic novel, an audio drama, a novel, and recently announcing the Absurdaverse . Before leaving Rockstar, Houser was a lead writer on every GTA game since GTA London 1969 (released in 1999), and with GTA5 first releasing in 2013 it's not unreasonable to think he may have had some involvement there. Not so. In a new interview with IGN Houser says he had no involvement with GTA 6: \"They're always a new story. It's not going to be a story I wrote or a character set that I developed, but I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure.\" Houser's asked if it'll be a bit weird playing a new GTA…",

Valve said back in February that the Autumn Sale would fire up a couple months early for 2025: It didn't say why, but the obvious guess is to put more room between it and the Steam Winter Sale: In previous years, the big year-ending blowout would kick off just a couple weeks after the end of the Autumn Sale, and that's just not enough time between two of the biggest videogame sales of the year.

This week I've been: continuing to play way too much Borderlands 4 and waiting for Battlefield 6. One thing that surprised me from the Battlefield 6 beta back in August was that Battlefield Studios seemed to be aiming for a more casual, fast-paced experience. Smaller maps are one thing, but the remarkably frictionless weapon handling seriously ramped up the speed of shootouts and all but removed the need to tap or burst fire at longer ranges. Simply by slapping a single-port brake or the basic folding vertical grip on any weapon would immediately resolve any recoil issues. In this way, the Battlefield 6 beta felt an awful lot like a battle royale—Call of Duty Warzone being the elephant in the room—in which weapons are highly efficient at way further ranges than they really should be. It was a shame, considering Battlefield has long prided itself on being more realistic/grounded/authentic (you name it) than Call of Duty. It's also ironic, given that Battlefield 6 will actually have a battle royale component, and I've no doubt this more streamlined weapon handling was designed with…",

These comments follow a podcast passage where Huang is generally complementary about the current US administration. Huang said, \"[President Trump] wants America to win the AI race. This is going to be a very long-term race, and he understands this is a pivotal time. He wants the technology industry to run. He wants everybody in the world to be built on American technology.\" But China has been busy, accelerating its own AI infrastructure plans with a reported mandate that its domestic data centres source at least 50% of their chips from similarly domestic manufacturers to avoid a reliance on US-made tech.

Essentially, Europe feels like it's fallen behind in chip production and design, and it would like to see a concerted effort from the European Commission to regain ground. \"To secure and strengthen our global position,\" the declaration reads (via The Register ), \"the EU must prioritize the semiconductor sector as a strategic industry, on par with aerospace and defence, and treat it as a key target for investment, R&D and innovation, and—if necessary—use the available instruments to protect it and act collectively. \"However, while global competitors are significantly ramping up public investment, much of the value creation in the semiconductor industry is occurring outside the EU,\" it continues. \"This underscores the need for a strengthened, second-phase EU Chips Act that is both ambitious and forward-looking.\" You have to agree with the signatories here, which represent each of the countries within the EU today, that Europe has slipped up with chip production.

Curry actually made a similar announcement almost exactly a year ago, releasing a video in which she announced there would be \"no more gaming videos\" from her—in effect, that she was retiring from the Let's Play life. But the following December, Curry felt the Skyrim urge once more and returned to the game, and even fired up Oblivion Remastered in May to check out Cyrodiil for the first time. So it's entirely possible that Curry might change her mind once again, and have a second come-to-Todd moment after a well-earned rest much like she did before. But I wouldn't put any bets down to that effect. Curry sounds tired, and in particular she doesn't seem to be getting the things she wants from her Skyrim uploads. \"I have a few older regular viewers\", Curry said, \"but most of them seem to be very young k…",

Capcom and Square Enix teamed up during Tokyo Game Show this weekend to show off a little more of the crossover. Monster Hunter: Wild's half is out right now—with hunters able to take on Omega Planetes—while Final Fantasy 14 joins the party on October 7 with The Windward Wilds trial that lets Warriors of Light face off against Arkveld. Even skimming through Final Fantasy 14's portion of the showcase this weekend, the encounter with Arkveld felt considerably more MMO-y than Monster Hunter. Which sounds daft, but not so much when you compare it to the game's previous collaboration with World which introduced a fight against Rathalos. While it was still quite MMO-like—it was literally in Final Fantasy 14, after all—it felt like there was a real concerted effort to integrate as much Monster Hunter madness as it could.

Creative director Graeme Timmins has already agreed as much, noting the infamous knives \" will get addressed \", alongside some unintentional interactions and broken builds, very soon. For those living under a rock, the Penetrator Augment that can drop on throwing knives causes all damage dealt to the target to become guaranteed critical hits for a short duration. With almost any build, especially those specced into bonuses with critical hits or status effects like the bleed Vex build , this short window is more than long enough to burst down any boss in the blink of an eye. Plus, you can also get the Damage Amp Payload effect, which—in the same vein as Penetrator—causes the target to simply take increased damage for a duration. In fact, you can even get these two bonuses together if you're lucky for guaranteed critical hits and a flat increase in damage…",

It turns out the seemingly perfect alternate dimension Peacemaker has been hanging around in is actually one where America lost to Hitler in World War 2. Essentially, he's accidentally found himself in Nazi utopia, exclusively populated by white people and where the American flag's stars have been exchanged for a swastika.

      "body": "Battlefield 6's official launch is just over a week away, and while most players are counting down the seconds, some are revelling in the latest official live-action trailer that seems to poke fun at a certain competing FPS franchise. The trailer starts with a bunch of celebrities: Zac Efron, Jimmy Butler, Morgan Wallen, and Paddy Pimblett gearing up for a fight, but sadly, they don't really get too far as they're blown to bits in just a couple of seconds. This is followed by an unknown soldier asking, \"Who was that?\" as another soldier replies, \"Doesn't matter, let's move.\" I was pretty relieved when I saw these celebrities get blown up. It's not like I've got anything against them, but seeing a Battlefield 6 trailer with guest stars didn't fit the vibe that I thought Battlefield Studios was going for with this latest game. One of the biggest fears many players have had throughout the lead-up to Battlefield 6 was that it would unceremoniously morph into Call of Duty at some point, be that by adding ridiculous skins or with weird collabs that are out of place in its gritty battleground. So blowing up Zac Efron and co may seem like a bit much, but it has worked wonders in quelling …",

Not me, though. Not because I love Windows 11, but because I'm still miffed about something that happened 10 years ago: the death of Windows 7. Now that was an operating system with hair on its chest. And for dedicated enough users, it turned out it never truly died at all. As YouTuber ChrisPro recently found out, you can even run Silksong on Win7 with some elbow grease and a can-do attitude. Okay, to be fair, it's not an easy process. Steam stopped officially supporting Win7 as recently as January 2024, which means even getting the client running is a headache. ChrisPro had to root around in their Steam install and kill off a couple of dll files to trick the client into booting. Once it did, the entire experience had an ominous red message reading \"Steam will stop running on Windows 7 in 0 days\" looming over it. Then,…",

The over-reliance on literal toilet humor in Borderlands 3 was so universally disliked that a follow-up was always going to pare it back a bit. Which Borderlands 3 does, though sometimes too much. The villains in particular end up feeling like personality-free zones, some of them not even having enough going on to fill the empty space on their introductory title cards. They're just names and hit points. The sidequests squeeze in some of the personality the main questline leaves out, and even (whisper it) reference the occasional meme. My favorite so far is Forgive Me, a quest based on a viral joke about the storytelling in Soulsborne games—a joke tweeted by Borderlands 4 head writer Sam Winkler back in 2022. (Image credit: Sam Winkler) Because the internet is the way it is, Winkler ended up having to explain in the replies that he actually likes FromSoftware games, saying, \"I am begging anyone who thinks I'm dunking on fromsoft to learn how to make fun of the things you love\".

So, while things might get off to a rocky start, issues will get smoothed out as those ideas are refined. As reported by GamesRadar , in an interview with Edge Magazine, 2XKO director Shaun Rivera commented on Riot's hopes (and fears) for the game, stating, \"We're the type of team where we want to try stuff. Sometimes it's going to land and sometimes it's going to whiff, but we will be trying things. I want to set those expectations for players that something we try might go wrong or it might not be good, but we'll address it.\" Rivera also noted that \"it's going to be a little bumpy when we get out,\" although that's to be expected with any early access game. Even if 2XKO wasn't in early access, though, Rivera makes the case for a little leeway, adding, \"I do want to call out, though, that we're a team of people making a fighting game for the first time in a sense, and we don't have …",

He went on to add that, \"Technology and console aside, our workflows and the way we built our worlds throughout each iteration, for Forza Horizon 6 [we took] lots of learnings from past games.\" One of the \"past games\" that influenced Horizon 6 most was (somewhat surprisingly) the Hot Wheels DLC for Horizon 5, as Arceta explained: \"We actually developed a new way to create those orange tracks that go around the road to get the best quality and have it be authentic [to Hot Wheels].

Today's show was quite the change from our usual summer and Most Wanted broadcasts. The Tokyo Game Show has been going for almost 30 years, so we figured it was high time we got in on the action and highlighted some of the excellent games there. People at the show were lucky enough to get hands on with Farmbotic, a cozy farming sim with adorable robot companions. For those of us at home, the trailer in our Tokyo Direct still gives a good glimpse at what it's all about. For your viewing pleasure, we've got the zombie carnage of Killing Floor 3, the cartoonish and charmingly British Earth Must Die, and one of the coolest games we've ever seen, Denshattack, where you play as a train carriage that's also the best skateboarder in the world.

Don't Lie was shown off for the first time during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, and the trailer gave me chills. Junko is a \"hikikomori,\" someone who secludes themself at home, away from the outside world. Following a therapeutic program, Junko finds herself alone again, desperately trying to reconnect with two of the people she met during the process. One is Shinji, the protagonist of Don't Watch. The game is all first-person, and you'll venture throughout Juno's apartment and her own, crumbling psyche which is conjuring up liminal spaces and terrifying hallucinations.

Part of that I attribute to its original fantasy world where it feels like the devs, unshackled by the aesthetic constraints of a 20-year-old series, were able to make something far more grandiose than grimy streetfights. Who better, then, to bang out the soundtrack than Yuka Kitamura, mastermind behind the tunes of Elden Ring and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice? A studio recording was revealed during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, interspersed with some new clips of the game's combat. It's all snarling strings and portentous vocal melodies, and given that it's performed by a live orchestra, it's a level of production value the sidescrolling beat 'em up is treated to less often than I'd like.

The triple threat character setup means you can launch an enemy into the air with one character, switch to another, and send them crashing back down in a matter of seconds.
