It's like, literally, we've never had it like this\". The problem is, it seems, the slow pace of game development—especially if you're Larian, you're going to be designing architecture for a game that'll be both simultaneously coming out in a few years but also releasing now, so figuring out a level of optimisation that's reasonable (while still making the thing look good) takes a bit of soothsaying. \"It kind of ruins all of your projections that you had about,\" he explains, \"because normally, you know the curves, and you can protect the hardware.

Why? Crandall, who has worked at Kingston for 29 years, says the company is experiencing NAND wafer price spikes the likes of which have never been seen before. In conversation with Mark Hachman on The Full Nerd Network podcast , Crandall got specific, saying there's been \"a 246% increase in NAND pricing as compared to Q1 of 2025.\" He later goes on to elaborate, \"We just recently saw a 70% increase in NAND costs over… I think it was a 60-day period. So, that 250% I mentioned earlier—70% of that was increased within the last 60 days.\" As NAND flash chips make up about 90% of a single SSD's Bill of Materials cost, that's an especially eye-watering uptick for both businesses and general consumers alike. As such, Crandall offers a word of advice to anyone considering upgrading their rig's storage: \"Do it now and [don't] wait, because prices are going to continue to go up.\" In other words, we've yet to see just how high SSD prices can go.

And at first glance, a report that Nvidia is planning on cutting discrete GPU production by up to 40% just seems like a case in point. However, while it is all RAM-related, it's not necessarily bad tidings. The claim in question was posted on the Chinese Board Channels forum (via Benchlife and Overclock3D ) and basically claims that Nvidia is set to reduce the supply of its gaming GPUs by between 30% and 40% in the first half of 2026, compared to the volume of output during the same period in 2025. That's not surprising given that the DRAM supply problems, affecting the entire computing industry, will result in fewer desktop and laptop PCs being shipped next year. Given just how many of them typically sport an Nvidia discrete GPU, either soldered onto the motherboard or in the form of a third-party graphics card, the demand for RTX Blackwell chips is obviously going to plummet. However, there's not exactly a huge shortage of GeForce RTX 50-series cards at the moment, with the exception of sensibly priced RTX 5080 and 5090 models.…",

There's the conclusion of the Arcadion raids, an overhauled glamour system—oh, and a debug \"blue deer doe\" roaming around in Coerthas Western Highlands with no name, just a menacing icon indicating it's hostile if approached and a level one indicator next to it. excuse me what is this pic.twitter.com/FtPfZypaio December 16, 2025 Naturally, it has taken no time at all for the community to rally around this being and treat it as if it were our collective son. Groups have gathered near the deer—which some theorise has a measly 40HP —to take photos of it, pet it, and quickly scold anyone who dares kill it. The level 1 debug mob cult is strong. \"I went and saw one a while ago,\" a Reddit comment reads. \"I killed it and the person standing there yel…",

Maybe it's the sicko Destiny 2 player in me talking, but character fashion is properly important. With the Expedition rewards announcement that we were getting the \"Patchwork skin\", but with no visual reveal, a lot of players were worried that Embark was referring to a pretty unappealing skin from the server slam.

The shopper in question goes by the handle BravoNorris, and had scooped up the last four available XPG Caster 32 GB DDR5-6000 CL40 kits from Adata, each containing two sticks of 16 GB memory. All were sold as new and sealed from Amazon Spain. After selling one, and installing another, BravoNorris opened a third box only to find the sticker scam in their hand. That's when they reached out to VideoCardz with the story . This third box was plastic-wrapped like the other three, and had shipped from the same point of origin in Ireland. However, this box contained two old sticks of DDR2 memory with DDR5 heatsink stickers that could fool someone only checking the product through the packaging window. BravoNorris also found a small plate of metal inside the box, likely placed to account for the weight discrepancy. As such, what'…",

A higher viscosity than MX-6 but not as viscous as MX-4. I'll stop saying viscous now. The company suggests it can lower CPU temperatures by as much as a couple of degrees versus MX-6 in its own testing, though we have a third-party test to take a look at in a moment. MX-7 is already available to purchase in a variety of sizes. I'd normally round prices, but since we're talking pennies between some of these sizes, here they are in full: 8 gram - $8.59 4 gram - $7.39 4 gram with cleaning wipes - $9.59 2 gram - $6.89 Why you'd buy anything other than 8 grams with these sorts of prices is beyond me. Grab some isopropyl and a big tube, and you're sorted for cleaning and reapplication for years to come. Arctic recommends a cross pattern for applying MX-7.

Valve doesn't share its exact working, here, but I'm happy to assume that the company makes an effort to bar completely inactive accounts in these tallies, because Steam's been kicking for over 22 years at this point—if it didn't, that number would be a lot smaller. I'm also made more reasonably confident by the fact that this is a pattern that's held (somewhat) stable for four years now—with only one outlier in 2023. As we noted last year , the historical data for this same statistic are as follows: Players spent 17% of their time on same-year releases in 2022… 9% in 2023 and 15% in 2024.

But right off the bat in Fallout Season 2, Episode 1, we get to see a location I remember fondly from one of the Fallout games—and surprisingly, it has absolutely nothing to do with New Vegas at all. Thinking about it, this location is probably the place I've spent the most time out of all of the Fallout games I've played. When it showed up in the episode, I immediately got a buffout-sized dose of nostalgia. As the kids say, it hit me right in the feels. (Apologies if the kids no longer say this.) In Episode 1, Lucy and the Ghoul are following Hank's bloody footprints through the desert from California to Nevada, and they discover he made a stop at a location players of Fallout 4 are sure to recognize: the Starlight Drive-In Theatre.

Case in point: Hank MacLean, played by Kyle MacLachlan in Prime Video's Fallout series. Hank is the ultimate business zealot. Before the bombs fell, Hank was so dedicated to his work at Vault-Tec that he voluntarily had himself cryogenically frozen for a couple centuries. He got thawed out, married a Vault-dweller named Rose, had two kids, and then murdered 30,000 people with an A-bomb. All in the name of business. And he was just getting started! In the final episode of Season 1, Hank saw his daughter learn what a monster he was, left her behind to mercy-kill her ghoulified mother, then stomped his way across the desert to reach New Vegas. As Season 2 begins we see that Hank has not been shattered by the consequences of his evil acts: he's actually invigorated and ready for more.

Rex, and one of the most mysterious cut locations from Fallout: New Vegas . I'm of course talking about Vault 24. Over the course of Fallout's life, there have been many iconic Vaults mentioned and featured in games. Many were the childhood homes of our protagonists and player characters—like Lucy's own Vault 33, or Vault 13 from the OG Fallout. But the vaults run the gamut from capsules of Americana to harrowing psychological experiments. Here are just some of the more interesting examples: Vault 4 (TV Show): In season 1, we saw Lucy and Maximus explore Vault 4, the previous home of a group of scientists who experimented with mutants and Wastelanders. Vault 11 (New Vegas): A social experiment took place to see how willing people would be to sacrifice others for the safety of the majority.

The topic came up in a recent interview with IGN , and Howard was pretty clear it's a 'no' from him: \"They've offered me a whole bunch, even in Season 1,\" says Howard. \"I was going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things. I think I'm best behind the camera.” Spoiler alert for Season 1, obviously. This scene is one of the revelations that occurs towards the end of that season, and is a flashback to how Vault-Tec executives and various other business big-hitters divide the various vault experiments between themselves before they agree to drop the bombs.

At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs. Samsung's SFP2 process is generally thought to be inferior to TSMC's various N2-generation silicon. However, AMD currently makes GPUs on …",

So when ZSA offered to send over its Voyager keyboard, along with its new Navigator trackball module, I had high expectations. Essentially, the Voyager is a pared-down Moonlander, with all excess fat trimmed away to leave as minimal a keyboard as possible. \"Laptop-friendly,\" says ZSA's marketing. \"Goes anywhere—on your desk or on the road.\" I certainly can't argue with that because with just 52 keys and a total thickness of just 16 mm (0.62 inches), the Voyager is as whisper-thin as you could want. However, both the thickness and key count result in some notable compromises. For example, there's no wireless connectivity option because batteries would add to the weight, cost, and size of the keyboard.

      "body": "Baldur's Gate 3's fully motion captured and voiced dialogue was the clearest sign that the developer had stepped into the big leagues after Divinity: Original Sin 2. The earlier RPG had great writing and voice acting for key dialogue, but it didn't pull you into the performances in the way BG3 would a few years later. Larian knows that's what people now expect from its RPGs, and it's already bringing actors into the studio to work on Divinity . \"We're still casting, but we already have a bunch of actors in,\" studio founder Swen Vincke told PC Gamer in an interview after The Game Awards , where Divinity was revealed. Unlike a film that's written first and then shot, Larian's creative process entails capturing its actors' performances as soon as development is out of pre-production. \"This gives you an idea of the ambition,\" he said. \"We built a huge studio in Guilford, with six recording studios in there. The idea is that these are going to be recording nonstop on this game, which gives you an idea of the ambition. It's big, because we want you to have lots and lots and lots of choice. This is a project where recording is almost at the beginning.\" Vincke didn't give even a rough est…",

Rather than try to shoehorn our favourite games into a handful of fixed categories, we ask each member of the team to nominate up to six games released this year. Then we tally up the votes, hop into a big, global call, and argue over which games are worthy of an award—as well as picking our Game of the Year itself. Once the games are chosen, we assign award categories based on what quality we think that game specifically excels at. That's why there's a different selection of categories each year. And what a year it's been—full of surprises, some disappointments, and a handful of games that dominated the conversation throughout. Let us know in the comments which games you've loved the most this year.

      "body": "I was worried about Fallout Season 2. The dud second season is a cliché in TV just like it is in sport—the sophomore slump where a show loses its spark. Amazon should know this well, having turned a bunch of The Rings of Power's second season into a weird rehash of Star Wars with Tom Bombadil as Yoda. And though I didn't hate the second season of The Witcher, it was a shame to lose the twisty structure of the first season's jumbled timeline, which relied on viewers spotting details to untangle which events took place when, and not gain anything nearly as thinky to replace it. So I went into Fallout Season 2 with concerns. For starters, I expected the pre-war flashbacks to become vestigial, hurried past to get on with the modern day story of Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Praise be to the Atom then, that the flashbacks remain central. Barb continues making moral compromises on behalf of her family and Coop keeps finding out about corporate shenanigans that force him to become involved. But usually the reason TV shows disappoint in their second season is, while the first season can focus on introducing the core cast, the second needs to broaden things to keep generating new story.

      "body": "In the wake of its gruesome Game Awards reveal , everyone was arguing about whether Divinity would be turn-based like Baldur's Gate 3 , or an action RPG. Wonder no more: in a post-TGA interview with PC Gamer, Larian boss Swen Vincke confirmed that Divinity will be a turn-based RPG, and elaborated a bit on what we can expect from its combat and systems. \"It's not a clone of D:OS 2 in that sense, it's a new ruleset, a ruleset built on everything that we learned from all the previous games that we've done,\" said Vincke. \"I think you're gonna enjoy it. It's very easy to learn, very hard to master, but it allows you to do fantastic things, which is the most important bit. \"It's going to give you a really good time figuring things out, and how you can chain things to one another and come up with all kinds of shenanigans.\" When asked whether Divinity would be turn-based and have a similar party size to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke responded in the affirmative. Baldur's Gate 3, as well as both Original Sin games, allow four characters in your active party at any time. So while Vincke didn't provide the exact number, four seems like a sure bet.
