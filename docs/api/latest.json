The DoJ says that these cybercrimes resulted in the theft of an eye-watering $18 billion over three years. Tymoshchuk is accused of being \"an administrator\" behind various ransomware including MegaCortex, LockerGoga, and Nefilim. From late 2018 to October 2021 Tymoshchuk is alleged to have first operated LockerGoga and MegaCortex attacks, which in the latter case changes the passwords and encrypts all files on a host computer, before issuing threats to the user and demands for payment. LockerGoga was used in an attack on Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian energy company, that affected all of its 170 sites and caused an estimated $81 million in damages. When these ransomwares were decrypted by cybersecurity professionals, Tymoshchuk allegedly moved on to engineer and manage Nefilim, which is sold to third-party attackers in exchange for 20% of the funds stolen …",

I'm a simple man with a simple past as a simple delivery driver in a simply depressing town—when a game's able to capture the strange appeal of otherwise dire gig work, it earns a place on my wishlist. Particularly when it's got a lovely PS1 demake aesthetic and a good lo-fi soundtrack. Our Mollie Taylor was equally impressed by its cozily dour energy . Now, I'm pleased to report that its tenure on my waitlist will be a short one, because Easy Delivery Co. is launching a week from today on September 18. (Image credit: Oro Interactive) \"What started out as a little project on Itch has now become quite the adventure,\" developer Sam C said in a Steam news post announcing the release date. \"The game features three different areas for you to explore and deliver items in, with various truck upgrades allowing you to reach new places. Meet the residents of these towns, talk to them (or try to), and learn more about the snowy regions you found yourself in.\" Compared to the demo, it sounds like the full releas…",

It's not like I need an excuse to play, but running through Nightlords and Everdark Sovereigns was starting to get tedious. I wanted a new challenge, and what better than a ranked \"endless mode\"? Deep of Night isn't endless in the sense that you just keep going day after day until you die, but it is endless in the sense that you rank up or down depending on whether you win a run, and then your progress affects your rank, which you can keep working towards.

The first Championship Manager wasn't a hit, but it wasn't a flop either, and follow-up Championship Manager 93 made several improvements.

There are also many perks that boost weapon DPS, whether through rate of fire, elemental buffs (radiation or cryo), or straight-up damage increases.

Unfortunately, you're restrained by how many skill points you can earn, which is based on the current max level , so you can't splash the cash and unlock every power. Below, I'll go over the max level in Borderlands 4 and how many skill points you can expect to earn right now, so you can properly plan out your characters ' builds. However, I'll also discuss whether we can expect this to increase in the future. What is the max level in Borderlands 4? The max level in Borderlands 4 is 50 , giving you a total of 49 skill points to spend across your three skill trees. Every five skill points you spend unlocks the next layer of the skill tree, apart from the final tier, which requires an extra point to get the final perk. In other words, you could almost reach the end of two skill trees if you're being efficient, though that's not really optimal for most builds. There are a few key features related to your progression: You'll start encountering loot drops with Firmware as early as level 25 (these are effectively gear sets).

But whaddaya know, it turns out it's actually reasonably achievable, as demonstrated by our host, Vik-on (via Videocardz ). While plenty of modders have strapped more memory modules to graphics cards in the past, it's usually been a technical exercise, rather than creating a genuinely useable GPU at the end of it. Vik-on, however, looks to have been able to double the VRAM capacity of their RTX 4090 successfully with relative ease. Key to this achievement is a leaked Nvidia BIOS, which gives our modder the ability to force support for different capacities and amounts of memory modules using Ada-generation chips. Making the graphics chip itself play nicely with more memory, though, is only half the battle. The new modules also need to physically connect wi…",

This is a classy case, and, whether it's aimed at pro creators or pro gamers, one that many should consider for their next build—but not without some caveats. The initial draw of the PA401? Real wood. You know you've made it when your PC case was once alive. Each of the slats over the front intake on the PA401 is made from (sustainably sourced) ash with a glossy finish. So glossy, in fact, the grain is far less noticeable compared to the Fractal Design Terra or North. It's almost indistinguishable from plastic unless you're right up to it. Personally, I like it. The understated wood effect fits with the diminutive design across the rest of the case. But other members of the PC Gamer team thought it needed a little more pizazz. Altogether a simple case to build into, the ProArt stands out for the smaller details.

Over the last few years we've seen an influx of games specifically designed to echo the feeling of autumn, but this year is a little light on the orange leaves, pumpkin spice, cinnamon roll-inspired game front.

(Image credit: FromSoftware) I decided to test out just how lethal the Night Tide is now in one of my Deep of Night expeditions. After the second-day boss my two teammates carried on into the gloop, which sends you to the Nightlord boss arena, but I decided to head over to a close Site of Grace that was located in the Night Tide. It was but steps away from the safe zone, and I didn't even make it. My health bar wasn't as big as it could've been, as I was only level 12 at the time and hadn't picked tons of HP buff effects, but the Night Tide still took a fifth of my health off in a matter of seconds. To make matters worse, on my second trip back into the Night Tide to go get my lost runes, I decided to overshoot and go to a Site of Grace…",

I'm not sure what happens when you receive the title back—I like to think trumpets herald a messenger carrying your new, gold-plated, diamond-encrusted plaque—but regardless, Musk has reclaimed the position, despite a year where his Tesla-enhanced fortunes have experienced the odd wobble or two .

There's actually a whole bunch of stuff in this one. The level cap continues its inexorable crawl upwards (it's 100 now), you can now advance the time of day at-will once you have a certain hideout upgrade, and scouts have gotten better—upgrade them enough and they'll be able to spot viewpoints and safehouses when you dispatch them to foggy areas on the map.

And honestly, as someone who's getting on in years and feeling the toll of endless hours at a desk, I'm always on the hunt for anything that might make those marathon computer sessions a little less punishing on my back. Enter the LiberNovo Omni : apparently the world's first dynamic ergonomic chair that promises real-time spine support, motorized lumbar adjustment, four distinct recline positions, and even a built-in spinal stretch massage. The idea of a chair that could actually adapt to how I sit—rather than forcing me into its own mold—was enough to make me take a closer look. But is it the revelation we've been waiting for, or just a flashy Kickstarter moonshot with a few too many moving parts? Unboxing the Omni, I immediately notice its sci-fi vibe. The back support bar looks like it belongs in a spaceship cockpit, and the seat cushion is plush but breathable—think memory foam with a…",

What's so visually impressive about it, at least to my eyes, is how it keeps balance and makes quick decisions and very human-like arm and leg movements.

Taking two hits of damage rather than the one we were used to in Hollow Knight (since it was so rare for an enemy to inflict two) has certainly been a learning curve for a lot of people. But that hasn't stopped the usual suspects declaring that the game isn't difficult and those struggling simply need to \"get good\". If you fall among this crowd, I applaud you and just know every time I run back to the Savage Beastfly arena I'm struck with a pang of jealousy. But if you're (somehow) finding the game too easy, fret not. There's now a mod that allows you to increase the double damage caused by some enemies to triple. The 'No Double Damage' mod created by TheLima does exactly what it says on the tin, but not in the way you'd think.

That compares with about 3,500 for the best AMD desktop CPU . And may I remind you, that's in a freaking phone. The A19 Pro in a desktop with the power budget and thermals that affords would be higher still, well over 4,000. If a new AMD or Intel CPU popped up in Geekbench hitting, say, 4,500, the internet would just about break. And to be clear, these Geekbench numbers for the A19 Pro are plausible. The previous-gen A18 Pro scores around 3,500 points in Geekbench 6. So, a 15% boost to 4,000 points for the latest chip fitted to a phone with a new vapor chamber cooling system doesn't seem like a massive stretch. Of course, Geekbench is hardly the perfect benchmark. And it's demonstrably not a game. But comparative real-world performance in applications doesn't tend to be a million miles away from Geekbench.

Henry of Skalitz, lovable medieval yokel and protagonist of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (and 1, for that matter), which makes it all the more impressive that the game's recent 1.4 patch snuck in a new secret ending (via GamesRadar ) for those players who manage to single-handedly annihilate an entire enemy army. Uncovered by an industrious Redditor , the new ending can be found in the quest called The Lion's Den. That'd be the one where Henry infiltrates the camp of King Sigismund's army and solves a murder: heavy on sneaking about, investigation, and social skills. Unless you're cool, that is. In which case, you stroll into camp, draw your sword, and promptly massacre like a billion enemy soldiers. Make your way through enough of them, and you'll eventually hit a new endgame screen, reading \"You changed history! Sigismund lost his army and returned to Hungary in disgrace.\" You see? Indiv…",

So, plenty of new content to really sink your teeth into. In addition, this update also sees the addition of creative mode and custom world settings which let you fine-tune your experience by tweaking things like hunger and thirst rates, and making your world unique to you.

To help you make that all-important decision, I'll give you an overview of each Vault Hunter and their three broad playstyles. However, I'd be foolish not to note that the 'meta' doesn't really matter in Borderlands, so pick whichever character you think looks the coolest. Plus, Borderlands 4 finally lets you skip the campaign on alternate characters, so it's easier than ever to try out all the Vault Hunters. Who's the best character in Borderlands 4? If I had to pick just one, the best character in Borderlands 4 is Rafa , primarily due to his incredible ability to buff his gun damage across both his Remote Agent and People Person skill trees.

I need restrictions if I'm to be a good, selfless teamplayer, which is where Rogue Point comes in. I got to check out this upcoming co-op FPS roguelike at Gamescom. It's made by the same devs (Crowbar Collective) who managed to pull off the Half-Life remake Black Mesa , so my hopes were high from the start. The vision for Rogue Point is simple: make a co-op shooter that actually requires players to be cooperative—groundbreaking, I know.
