Since 2022, it's gained spell checking, a dark mode, tabbed windows, state preservation, and even basic formatting. With the latest update, tables have joined the feature set, which feels useful, along with AI text streaming, which feels decidedly less useful. As I use Notepad daily, I was already aware of the new additions, but it's thanks to Windows Latest that I know everyone using Windows 11 should see them, too. Well, perhaps not the AI text streaming, because that's apparently still only for Copilot+ PCs (ones with a CPU that has a 40+ TOPS NPU in them), though Microsoft says it will eventually roll it out to all Windows 11 systems. The table function is blessedly simple in form and function, and if you're already familiar with tables in Microsoft Word, you'll have no problems using this one. You start by clicking on the icon in the menu bar, then dragging out the initial table you want to use. Adding or removing elements can be done through the same button, but it's easier to just right-click and edit everything from there. If you're a Notepad purist, yo…",

Released in 1998 and 1999, neither has been re-released in any sort of arcade collection or made available digitally until now, via in-game emulation in Yakuza 3 Kiwami. Both are delightful. Magical Truck Adventure is classic Sega arcade stuff: bright and bubbly and immediately throwing all sorts of stuff at the screen within seconds. You take control of one of two kids operating an old-fashioned train handcar, chasing down a pair of crooks who've stolen your magical jewel and decided to flee by rail, making them incredibly easy to catch. At least if you're in good shape: the physical arcade machine requires you to constantly pump the handcar's lever to maintain speed, while a pair of pedals allow you to lean left or right off the rails and jump over the barrels and other random obstacles they hurl your way. You also teleport/time travel between stages, naturally. (Image cred…",

So it's not at all surprising that the biggest new feature of Yakuza Kiwami 3's Dark Ties expansion is a roguelite mode that lets you beat up hordes of thugs copy-pasted from the streets of Kamurochō. Even so, there's something cleverly meta in building an entirely new and compulsively replayable randomized mode out of spare parts. It's almost a flex on games that do just one thing. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth contained within itself a whole Pokémon subsystem and Animal Crossing-style island building as mere side activities; why shouldn't Dark Ties tempt you to spend 20 hours doing runs to level up sidekicks, unlock new weapons, and earn stat-boosting gear like you would in any other roguelite?

Grace's parts will resemble Resident Evil 2 and 7, and will be \"really entrenched in the horror aspects of the gameplay\". In other words, expect to do a lot of creeping around in the shadows, a lot of urgent crafting in corners, and every bullet expended will count. Leon's parts will predictably channel the \"thrilling tension\" of Resident Evil 4, as well as its action focus. If you've ever wanted to deliver a roundhouse kick to a shambling zombie nurse, have I got good news for you. \"Each part is ordered to offer the ultimate balance of tension and release,\" Nakanishi explained.

The creators of that underrated gem, LABS Works, has been working on Lovish ever since, which was originally meant to release this time last year. It's not a metroidvania this time, but rather a single-screen platformer mixing simple Astalon-style combat with puzzles. I played the demo last year and goddamn does this game feel good . While the puzzles generally boil down to \"grab key, reach exit\", the final game promises over 50 levels, so who knows where the team will take it.

He left the company in 2003 to form now-shuttered studio Gaia, and hasn't been active in game development for 16 years. Until now: JRPG studio Compile Hearts, best known for the Neptunia series, has revealed Okada is working on a new \"school life RPG\" alongside fellow Atlus veterans. And in case the significance of Okada's input was unclear to you, Compile Hearts has you covered: they describe the game as “Okada’s ultimate message to those who will lead the next generation”. Compile Heart launched a teaser website today featuring an oblique, sci-fi trailer loosely reminiscent of the Megami Tensei universe, albeit with a slight horror bent. A name wasn't revealed nor a release window, but Compile Hearts has promised a proper reveal on January 29. Okada is joined by writer Tadashi Satomi, who is credited as a scenario writer for Persona 2 and Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga and its sequel, among others. Aside from Megami Tensei, he's also responsible for writing The Caligula Effect series, as well as Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising. The composer for Digi…",

The problem isn't the second season of character DLC, but the trailer promoting it, which many of them think is laden with AI generated content. Comments on YouTube accusing the trailer of being made with generative AI began flowing almost immediately after it was posted. Some called out specific characters who look AI generated; quite a few others made the point that SNK is backed by serious money now and shouldn't be looking to cut corners with gen AI. SNK was effectively acquired in 2022 by Saudi Arabia's Electronic Gaming Development Company , a division of the Mohammed bin Salman Foundation. Bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia (and credibly accused murderer ), is the prime mover behind the $55 billion buyout of Electronic Arts. So, yeah, a shortage of funds should not be an issue. \"All that Saudi money and can't pay someone a couple bucks to make real shit,\" YouTube commenter willthelemon5681 wrote.

The costume follows the upcoming Tomb Raider remake , Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, in straightforwardly recreating Lara's classic '90s look, with the minor tweak that her shorts are black rather than brown. Here's the full photo: (Image credit: Amazon) Overall, the reveal seems to have gone better than Netflix's 2018 reveal of Henry Cavill as Geralt . Cavill's makeup and costuming ended up looking respectable in the show, but it was hard to tell that was going to be the case from our first look—that wig sure looked wiggy. In contrast, Turner's Lara seems to be fairly uncontroversial; not everyone's favorite take on the character, but there's no big upset over it. (In saying that, I do have to exclude X's substantial population of massive losers, who have taken to complaining about the actor's proportions and using Grok to alter the photo in replies to the official Tomb Raider account .

Depending on your point of view, Bungie's Marathon reboot might have the most generous or restrictive free loadout of the bunch. As detailed in a new vidoc showing off all of Marathon's runner shells (essentially hero characters), Bungie says Rook is a unique class option that functions like a free loadout. You can't bring anything in with you, but you're supplied with basic kit for free and can keep whatever you find on a raid. That's more-or-less how the free loadout works in Arc Raiders, the most popular extraction shooter of the moment, but Bungie's implementation is different in two major ways: Rook players will always enter a match late, making it harder to compete for the best loot on the map Rook players can only queue solo Depending on where you land on Arc Raiders' free loadout debate , that could be fantastic news.

ICYMI: We just announced a new Fallout Shelter reality series, a fun collaboration between our friends at Kilter, Studio Lambert and Amazon Prime.Open casting is happening now if you think you've got what it takes to be a Vault dweller.

And yet… man, do I dislike my inventory. It's slightly weird that a game that gets so much bang-on fumbles when it comes to inventory management and loadouts. Your stash is a key part of these games: it's what you're going in for, after all. But I really find it a bit of a pain sometimes in Arc Raiders, especially when I just want to get back in there without clicking through 15 screens and working out what I can and can't recycle or sell. It's the one bit of the game's rhythm that feels off. Turns out I'm far from alone. Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins told PCG sister site GamesRadar+ that Embark Studios is \"super aware\" of players' gripes around loadouts and shuffling items around between runs.

You’re not getting quite the same level of GPU power or build quality either, but a cheaper laptop like the Acer Nitro V15 can still produce the goods. And the heat. And the noise. Acer has taken a trip back in time for the V15, with the model sent to PCG for review sporting a Core i7 13620H processor. That’s a Raptor Lake chip with ten cores split between four P-cores and six E-cores for 16 simultaneous software threads thanks to the 13th Gen coming before the death of P-core Hyper-Threading. It’s a chip from 2023, but its max turbo frequency of 4.9 GHz means it’s still competitive, even if it puts out a lot of heat and drives the Nitro’s cooling system crazy.

Because Mythic+ dungeons are all on a timer, and because WoW's dungeons tend to be a little more open-plan than something you'd get in, say, Final Fantasy 14, every single dungeon has a bespoke route filled with little tricks. And because this is Mythic+, you are expected to know them immediately, lest you be deemed a n00b, or something far ruder, which I won't publish on this website. Well, Blizzard's tinkering with a solution. On the Midnight beta test servers, the studio's introduced a new \"affix\"—basically a modifier—to Mythic+ levels 2-5. Per this post on the game's forums by a dev, \"While Lindormi’s Guidance is active, certain non-boss enemies will be afflicted with Temporal Sands, visually highlighting them an…",

Would the dudes and the gorillas be better served by turning against the masters that placed them in this arena in the first place?

Really though, it's an auto-battler, and it's honestly a solid bit of fun. Here's how it works: At the end of each round, you get to either post a flyer to start recruiting a certain dude type (thus defining your build), recruit a dude, or get one of three relics. If you've played any roguelike ever, you get how the relics work—they're stacking buffs that you need to synergise with your build, yadda yadda. The real tug of war is in the knockout system.

QPAD has been around for a long time, and back in the day it was somewhat of a leader in gaming peripheral tech. In the early 2000s, I recall its mice and keyboards being recommended pretty often on various forums. QPAD didn't give me my first ever mechanical keyboard—that honour goes to the original Razer BlackWidow—but it gave me my second, becoming one of my favourite upgrades I've had over all my years PC gaming. Back then, the QPAD MK-50 was one of a handful of great value mechanical gaming keyboards in what was then a pretty niche market. That keyboard lasted me years, and offered simple quality for a great price. Then the company all but disappeared, (in the UK at least, where I'm based). But now it's back, with a new stack of products in the UK and hopefully elsewhere as QPAD looks to expand globally again.

In fact, PC Gamer hasn’t reviewed many laptops with an RTX 5050 GPU. Creeping through the dusty stacks, marvelling at the symmetrical book stacking (just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947) and trying not to attract the attention of the librarian, I could find only one other point of reference: the Medion Erazer Scout 15 E1 . It didn’t do particularly well when put through the testing regime, which might have something to do with the Core i5 13420H and low, low price, but if you’re looking for PC gaming on a budget, it’s worth a look.

Case in point, German tech creator Aaron Christophel has got the original boomer shooter working on the touch screen of the Krups Cook4Me Smart cooking pot . It proves surprisingly easy to dismantle the kitchen appliance, with the bottom separating the heating elements from your counter top secured by a single screw (conversely, the separate touch screen module is firmly held in place with a whole two screws).

This follows news earlier this week that the South Korean memory manufacturer planned to invest a further 19 trillion won (or $12.90 billion) into another advanced chip packaging facility in Cheongju. The company announced in December that it planned \"to invest approximately 30% of our sales in facilities in 2026 and accelerate the transition to 1c DRAM , but it will be difficult to resolve the supply shortage.\" Expanding production was always part of the plan—but the AI industry's demand for memory has been scaling up faster than production can match. Sungsoo Ryu, CEO of SK Hynix America, told Reuters this week, \"We have to support memory consumption for AI infrastructure.\" To clarify, Ryu shared that the company wou…",

      "body": "If you currently game on Linux, or plan to in the future, game support has just been improved once again. Wine, a compatibility app for running non-Linux games on Linux has just hit version 11.0. You can find the full list of changes in the release notes , but there are a few main takeaways (via Gaming on Linux ). The first is that WoW64 mode, which can run 32-bit applications, is now considered fully supported and even includes 16-bit apps. As Windows can't natively run 16-bit applications, it's now as hard (or as easy) to run 16-bit apps on Linux as on Windows. Another big update with Wine 11, following on from its introduction in development builds of Wine 10, is the introduction of kernel module NTsync support. With this, Linux can emulate Windows NT' synchronisation primitives, which might not mean much to you, but minimises latency for demanding games. How much that performance increases by depends on many factors, but we expect a gaming uplift of some kind going forward. Wayland, a display protocol, has seen a handful of improvements in Wine 11, too, with \"shaped and color-keyed windows\" being supported in the experimental driver. Clipboard support has now been implemented …",

As if that wasn't enough, Matt Frior, the director of ESO left after 20 years at the company as a result of that incident. The MMO, however, appears to be choosing hope. Recent updates promise a complete overhaul to how content is released for the 12-year-old game, shifting to a seasonal pattern that should, the team hopes, make them far more agile. Especially when it comes to nixing quality of life and design bugbears which have been annoying the playerbase for years . I asked executive producer Susan Kath and game director Nick Giacomini how the studio had dealt with these blows and come back seemingly swinging for the fences. And while the response was understandably somber, both studio leads describe the atmosphere at ZeniMax as energised. \"Obviously last year was a tough year for the studio—as you said, for reasons we don't even necessarily need to dig into—but the team has very much rallied,\" Kath explains. \"I see a lot of enthusiasm from the team as we're goi…",

One of the tools you're given in Quarantine Zone is a handheld X-ray scanner that lets you look at the internal organs and bones of your victims patients. This is helpful for identifying symptoms of the zombie plague that might not appear on the outside of the body, like rotting lungs. (Gross.) It's also great for seeing if these survivors are trying to smuggle contraband into the military base. And many of them are. Sometimes it's something innocuous, like a bottle of beer—and boy, you've really gotta love beer to carry a bottle of it up your dumper through a military checkpoint. Usually, though, the contraband is something more dangerous like a baggie of narcotics or a weapon. That's a no-no.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. My first job covering videogames was a mid-2000s internship at a website dedicated to cheat codes, tips, and walkthroughs. My job was to read the user submissions and determine which were genuine cheats or secrets, and which were schoolyard rumors, hoaxes, or insults that had been indiscriminately lobbed at me through an internet form because someone was bored and Twitter didn't exist yet. As you can guess, I read a lot of \"yo momma\" jokes and not many legit tips, but I did go looking for corroboration of even outlandish claims, because you never knew. Back then, new games weren't immediately autopsied by dataminers, and their secrets weren't comprehensively catalogued on wikis and YouTube. All we had were GameFAQs writers, official Prima guides, hearsay, and whatever we could verify directly. Now and then I wrote to publishers to ask if they'd just tell us if there were any cheats in their new game—sometimes they did! The website I worked for is long gone, and c…",

EB Games Australia launched in 1997 as Electronics Boutique. Its first New Zealand outlet opened in Auckland in 2000, and in 2002, Electronics Boutique rebranded globally to EB Games.

It would, however, rely on either third-party ingenuity or uncharacteristic generosity from EA. I'll let you decide which is more likely. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) Anthem's live service network design had a client-server structure: To play, you and every other player would've had to connect to servers that handled the game's logic. Your PC didn't have to do the thinking. It just had to handle the results and make them look pretty.

Besides looks, Minecraft and Hytale have a ton in common: they both take place in \"infinite\" procedurally generated worlds with multiple biomes and deformable terrain, they both feature base-building and gear and weapon crafting, cooking, wildlife and fantasy monsters, and other similar systems. They can both be played solo or in co-op, they both have creative modes, and they're both moddable. And there's blocks. So many, many blocks. So… what's the actual difference between them?
