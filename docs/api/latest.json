At least it's not just you and me. Over the course of a wide-ranging chat about GOG's now-independent future , I asked new owner Michał Kiciński and managing director Maciej Gołębiewski if the storefront had much interest in the ongoing backlash against Windows and gamers' embrace—however small—of Linux.

But the impact of the buyout was incommensurate with its cost. For years, GOG has marketed itself as the videogame storefront with values: preserving games, keeping them DRM-free, and letting you actually own them. But values have a tendency to fall by the wayside in the tumult of a corporate sale. Players were concerned. But perhaps there's comfort to be taken from the fact that GOG's new boss is, quite literally, the same as the old boss. The store was acquired by Michał Kiciński, its original co-founder, under the explicit banner of preserving its integrity and mission statement. (Image credit: GOG) \"I think it has a very solid foundation as a company,\" Kiciński tells PC Gamer. \"Good results, a very good brand—known, respected—with very clear values, and customers love it and stand behind it.\" Plus, Kiciński has a sentimental attachment: \"The less business[-y] reasons [for buying GOG] were: I'm kind of a parent of the company.

Right now Elder Scrolls fans are huffing the copium thanks to a Microsoft tease that 2026 will be a \" big year for games ending in 6 \", but the reality is there's no indication what date Bethesda is aiming for with the next Elder Scrolls. That's one hell of a stretch, even for a marquee title, and our man reckons it's because Bethesda didn't want Starfield's debut to be overshadowed by the absence of The Elder Scrolls. \"My assumption was always that we were announcing Starfield,\" says Purkeypile, \"and it had been so long already since Skyrim that we needed to make sure people were not just pissed at us.

So rather than another day of doom and gloom talking about the rise of AI and the memorypocalypse , let's look at some positives. Probably the most important area we saw really exciting developments in was OLED monitors. One of the biggest problems with these that has probably stopped a lot of people from taking the plunge and buying one—alongside high price tags and worries about burn-in—is text fringing. OLED panels look fantastic for gaming, but for other things, they haven't always been the best choice, because small, thin, and wriggly little shapes such as letters (the most common little digital wrigglers) have tended to look a little fuzzy when displayed on an OLED panel. That's because of the way OLED displays its pixels. As a refresher, there are two main types of OLED panels: QD-OLED, from Samsung, and WOLED, from LG. These do things slightly differently at the sub-pixel level—QD-OLEDs have square red, green,…",

Goodman Games has been making some of the best ever for years now, as part of its Dungeon Crawl Classics series. They're unapologetically old school—weird, scary, and absolutely bursting with creativity. So I'm excited to see that Humble Bundle is offering a huge bundle of DCC books , including some of the coolest adventures it's released over the last decade and change. (Image credit: Goodman Games) These are all written for the Dungeon Crawl Classics system—Goodman Games' gonzo take on the original D&D rules—but are easily adapted to any system built for retro dungeon crawling, such as Old School Essentials, Mörk Borg, Shadowdark, or Knave. The 98 item tier is the standout here, offering all the adventures in PDF form, plus the DCC core rulebook, supplements, and assets for virtual tabletop play, for $18 / £13.43. I know we're probably all a bit jaded to massive bundles at this point, but that really is a wild amount of stuff for the money.

Called Redacted Regiment , the warbond is stuffed with suppressed weaponry and diversionary deployables for Helldivers who've been hoping since launch for a better stealth mission toolkit. Kept you waiting, huh? The warbond's main attractions are its silenced primary weapons. The R-72 Censor is a semi-auto precision rifle with an integrated suppressor for taking out enemies undetected at long range. For quietly clearing an area at closer quarters, there's also the AR-59 Suppressor, a silenced full-auto assault rifle. Technically speaking, the Redacted Regiment weapons won't be Helldivers 2's first suppressed primaries: That honor goes to the M7S SMG that was added with the ODST crossover warbond. But these two guns will likely offer more mainstay usability than their submachine gun cousin—though I'd still expect some amount of tradeoff in armor penetration or ammo count to keep them from being the only choice.…",

With version 4.5, Nvidia has introduced three new elements to its AI-powered suite of rendering technologies: a second generation transformer neural network for DLSS Super Resolution (aka upscaling), dynamic Multi Frame Generation (MFG), and a 6x mode. However, only the first one is available to use right now, as the new frame gen stuff won't make an appearance until spring. How to use DLSS 4.5 in games In order to force games to use the new upscaler, you'll need to use the 591.74 GeForce Game Ready drivers , plus the latest beta version of the Nvidia app (though a full release may be released by the time you're reading this).

      "body": "Sean Martin, Senior Guides Writer (Image credit: Future) Last week I was: finishing off my Expedition after grabbing the last Ion Sputter This week I've been: enjoying taking a break from Stella Montis Spawning late into a match in Arc Raiders never used to bother me that much—in fact, I kind of liked some aspects of it. You've got to admit, it's interesting to observe the aftermath of a round, finding corpses, dead Arcs, and just generally picking the bones. It can be surprisingly lucrative on occasion, but it's a real pain if you have any definite plans for a round or need to find specific items, which the game increasingly requires us to do with Expeditions, quests, and events. Having to get Ion Sputters and Frequency Modulation Boxes, resources unique to Stella Montis, for the new Expedition this time around has really brought home just how annoying late spawns are—if the Snap and Salvage quest hadn't already made the point. After all, even if you're just a few minutes late to Stella Montis, your chances of getting what you need are incredibly small, and that's not even taking into account the RNG of where you spawn. The only way I was ever able to get the items (which general…",

Lian Li is offering to replace the SX Platinum Series PSU's power cables, but not because they are in any way faulty. Instead, it's because initial batches of the platinum white cables look ever so slightly \"purple\" . Lian Li wrote, \"After further review, we agree that the current white cables do carry a noticeable purple hue, which may not be visually ideal for certain PC build aesthetics. For users who prefer a cleaner and more unified look, we’re happy to provide a replacement set of pure white cables to replace the existing ones and better complement their PC builds.\" Placed side-by-side, the difference is subtle but undeniable. Folks looking to replace their loosely lilac power cables need only submit a request via Lian Li's support request form .

The game's developed by Embark Studios, creators of The Finals , and has routinely dipped its toes into hot water over the usage of generative AI to produce voice lines. Statements have sometimes even contradicted each other. For example, in the story I just linked, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund was quick to emphasise that the studio wasn't using it to \"replace people\", even though replacing work you'd otherwise need a voice actor to come in and record is, uh, doing that. He then goes on to talk effusively about how Embark couldn't have made its two games without it, which strikes me as strange—either you replaced work that would've cost money you didn't have, or you didn't do that.

Amistech hasn't been resting on its laurels since then, though. While PC Gamer was taking its big holiday nap, My Winter Car launched in early access. Videogame sequels usually come with the caveat that it's totally OK to skip the original. Even if doing so actually seems a bit absurd, like a direct follow-up to a story-driven RPG. It makes sense: devs don't want to give people too many reasons not to pick up their new game. But My Winter Car is a sequel to a game that was specifically advertised as \"not fun\". It's not going for mass appeal. Instead of the challenge level starting from scratch, it's meant to build on the trials and tribulations you faced in the original game. It features \"added challenge for those who can master the original game,\" the Steam page warns. Given the complexity of My Summer Car, this means you're probably going to have an absolutely horrible time, which for games like this is absolutely a selling point. Ultimately this is still a game about fixing up an old project car, m…",

Fortunately, the Dungeon Descent Add-On may be the thing to change that, adding even more features to the game to help test your new spear-wielding skills. If you're an avid fighter, the randomly generated dungeons this DLC adds to Minecraft are bound to be the selling point. These will challenge you to use every attack the spear offers, pitting you against multiple mobs in different rooms but offering some valuable loot in exchange. According to the official blog post announcing the DLC , mining out of these dungeons \"won't be easy\" either, so you really should focus on brushing up your skills. To coincide with this new challenge, training dummies are available as part of the DLC too. So, you won't be entirely left to your own devices to master the art of the spear before plunging into a dungeon or being tasked with leaving your base at night to take down hordes of enemies.

SK Hynix is one of Nvidia's leading suppliers of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for its AI accelerators. The planned chip packaging facility is set to begin construction this April, but won't be able to address demand until after work is complete in late 2027 (via Bloomberg ). This follows news last year of the company committing an additional $500 billion to building four new memory fabs , with the first of these aiming for a similar 2027 completion window. Chey Tae-won, the chairman of SK Hynix's parent group, SK Group, recently spoke during a keynote speech at the SK AI Summit in Seoul, saying, \"We have entered an era in which supply is facing a bottleneck. We are receiving memory chip supply requests from many companies, and we are thinking hard about how to address all demands.” With the limited flow of memory now actively restricting how many data centres can be built, it's not the only company announcing pla…",

Quarantine Zone is a first-person medical sim you've probably been seeing clips of for months: it was a huge hit on TikTok following its first demo, and since the full game launched today on Steam you can expect to see a lot more clips, like this one of me carefully examining a guy before clonking him on the head with a hammer. The sim is a bit like Papers, Please without the papers or the please: you inspect survivors of the zombie apocalypse for signs of infection before letting them into the safety a military outpost, while also doing some light resource management around the base and a bit of fairly rote turret defense beyond the walls. You begin with just a flashlight to look for signs of a zombie virus as the survivors stagger in, one by one. Does the subject have red eyes? Weird bruises? A blatantly obvious zombie bite? If they seem a bit sick you can send them to quarantine…",

It is in no way merely a cover for me to revisit the topic of PC Gamer's official 2025 GOTY vote which I am definitely not still salty about here in 2026. * According to this very website , Blue Prince is the Best Designed game of 2025. True! But that award reflects that it was the runner-up to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which narrowly beat it for the top game of the year prize. To that result, I say: \"Rigged!!\" Okay, not rigged. But I believe I'll be vindicated by history in declaring this miraculous detective game, designed largely by a single mind over the course of eight years , as the game of 2025. I fought hard for Blue Prince to get PC Gamer's top GOTY honor, because I really don't think there's anything else like it out there.

But in a new interview with GamesIndustry , Kiciński and GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski said there's room for it to flourish and find success, even in a marketplace so utterly dominated by Steam. The core of the strategy seems simple enough: Throwing hands with Steam is a bad idea, so don't do it. \"Steam is obviously a Goliath,\" said Gołębiewski. \"So for any company to try to tackle Steam is a very hard battle. We've seen Discord launch their store, we've seen Epic Games launch their store—and thanks to the lawsuit with Apple, we know how much it has cost them to launch this battle against Steam. \"So the fact that GOG is expanding, developing, and still kicking, I think it's a testament to the fact that GOG really has its space on the market with its mission of making games live forever.\" Gołębiewski said Steam is \"doing an awe…",

The news triggered all sorts of reactions—some celebrated the idea of being rewarded for peaceful play with peaceful lobbies , others felt like Arc Raiders was penalizing them for enjoying PvP, and some worried their bloody trios matches would poison their solo matchmaking. After the hubbub Embark design lead Virgil Watkins took to setting the record straight in an interview with GamesRadar+ , starting with the label \"aggression-based matchmaking\" itself.

Originally planned to roll out in December, the DIY microtransactions didn't end up going live until January 9 , immediately after which things started going sideways.

Now, breaking ground on a new fab to actually manufacture memory chips might be a bit beyond the wit of even the most enthusiastic DIY'er. But where there's a will... The modder, who goes by the handle VIK-on, used a pair of 16 GB DDR5 laptop SODIMMs as a starting point. The next step was to source a compatible PCB with the aim of combining all 32 GB onto a single homebrew DIMM. Reportedly, the total cost of the build was $218, about a third of the going rate in Russia for a 32 GB DDR5 stick. Nice. VIK-on also looked into using even cheaper 8 GB sticks to source memory chips, but it seems the chip packaging raises problems when it comes to creating 32 GB sticks.
