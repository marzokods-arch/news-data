We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. As gamers, we all get up in the morning, check the latest gaming news, download updates for the games we want to play, then spend five to six hours closely examining the specifications and technical drawings of the latest videogame patents. Amirite? OK, maybe videogame patents aren't at the forefront of our minds, but they do come up as a topic from time to time, especially due to some of the more, ahem, litigious game companies out there. And even when they're not in the news, it can be kind of fun to look through patents for various gaming tech and game systems, especially when it comes to the diagrams included in the patents. In that spirit, I've got a new quiz for you! I'll show you a diagram from a videogame patent, and you do your best to answer a multiple choice question about it. You can hit the Hint button to remove one of the wrong answers if you need a little help. Good luck!",

Namely, they're fed up with pop-ads for the new Season 1 battle pass, they're unhappy with the new map Blackwell Fields , and they're miffed that the only way to complete weekly challenges is to play battle royale, a mode that doesn't necessarily appeal to the folks who paid $70 for Battlefield 6 three weeks ago. As expected, folks are taking their frustrations out on Battlefield 6's Steam rating , which has now dropped to an overall \"Mixed\" after an influx of over 5,000 negative reviews since yesterday. The flood of negative ratings pile on to an existing trend dating back over a week, around the time players were reacting to the too-blue \"Wicked Grin\" cosmetic , and when DICE axed XP gains from Portal servers in a bid to eliminate XP farms. \"Before season one it was like the moment when Gandalf showed in Helm's Deep there was hope.

Not quite a decade later, we find ourselves standing amidst the rubble of that once-great ambition, with a single question on our minds: What the hell went wrong? Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright . And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end : Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours ) but active development is over.

It was only a few months ago that Nvidia breached $4 trillion . But now here we are at $5 trillion. Where does it all end? Increasingly, market observers think the whole AI thing is a bubble set to catastrophically burst . Or maybe AI is the real deal, and an apocalypse of a very different kind will be upon us soon enough . But one thing is for sure. Whatever the outcome, there's no doubting Nvidia will have been absolutely pivotal. It dominates the AI industry when it comes to both hardware and the software development platforms on which it is all built. But as I watched CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address at the GTC event yesterday , his narrative around Nvidia was just a little too neat, a bit too cute. If you take Huang at his implied word, Nvidia saw it all coming. Personally, I think a fair bit of luck was involved. At GTC, Huang pointed…",

And thanks to these gorgeous remasters everyone can easily acquaint themselves with their importance and nod in sage agreement when someone claims it's possible to draw a line from Dragon Quest's \"little guy goes on a big adventure\" to Clair Obscur. I'm pretty sure that's what I'm supposed to say as a certified fan of ye olden dayes , anyway. Sometimes I feel like my job is to make sure these new-old games are digested in the \"correct\" way. I dish out appropriate explanations/excuses for their age and mumble phrases like \"timeless classic\" and \"historical context\" as I do so. Surely it'd be a complete waste of a re-release if these titans weren't respected as interactive history lessons, right?

As you'd expect from a battle royale, the types of skirmishes you'll get into in Battlefield Redsec are more varied, so you'll need guns to compete in a variety of different situations. SMGs and shotguns may be lethal up close, but you're going to want something with a bit more damage at range to pick up the slack when you're in a long-distance relationship with your enemy. Below, I'll go over all the weapons you should look out for while looting or use in a custom loadout in Battlefield 6 Redsec.

Charts on pcpartpicker.com are telling: since mid-2025, DDR4 and DDR5 consumer memory kit prices have been climbing, with particularly notable spikes since September. That's true all the way from DDR4-3200 kits up to DDR5-6000 ones. To take one concrete example, this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 kit on Amazon , which was stable at $95 or less throughout most of the year, but from mid-August onward started climbing. Now, it's up to $184, which makes for a 94% increase. This, after a good few months of sustained DDR5 price drops through the tail end of 2024 and first half of 2025. DDR4 isn't safe, either, as this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4-3600 kit on Amazon shows.

Well, I'd argue it's when you need to strap a bunch of external devices to it in order to get the most out of it, which is exactly what's happened to the Strix Halo-powered OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex . It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

He calls it the Vera Rubin \"superchip\" and claims it contains no fewer than six trillion transistors. Yup, six trillion. In very simple terms, that means the Vera Rubin superchip sports 60 times the number of transistors of an Nvidia RTX 5090 gaming GPU . And that is a completely bananas comparison. What's more, the Vera Rubin superchip is capable of 100 petaflops of raw compute. And that is exactly 100 times more compute than Nvidia claims for its neat little DGX Spark AI box . Oh, and it packs 88 custom Arm cores suporting 176 software threads for conventional CPU compute, too. On a side note, that Arm CPU bit (which alone is known as Vera) is interesting from a PC perspective as you might expect its custom designed CPU cores, which notably support multi-threading, could turn up in a PC processor in the future. Watch this space. At this point you may be wondering how any of this is possible. Six trillion transistors, 100 PF of compute, 88 CPU cores, all in one chip? OK, Vera Rubin is expected…",

I haven't had as long as I'd like with Embark's new extraction shooter, so this review is indeed in progress, with the final version coming sometime in the future when I've had a chance to properly experience it in all of its intersocial beauty. The premise of Arc Raiders is simple: the world has gone to hell thanks to robots and AI, so now all the humans are holed up in small communities underground, with you and other raiders occasionally popping up to the surface to gather resources to trade, create gear, and upgrade your base. On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff.

For those in a rush or who are simply stuck, here are the answers to all three of the questions, as well as what you'll get for a reward. The first dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit Elysium The answer to this is 4 . If you head outside and look at the orrery in the main courtyard, you'll see that there are four moons rotating around the big central grey planet (Elysium). The second dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit between Dorado and Elysium The answer to this is 1 . Head outside, once again, and you'll see via the orrery that there's only one small green moon that orbits between Elysiu…",

One group, the Displaced, want to further expand their camp to solve the overcrowding problem and the tensions it's causing, while the Order, a group of predictive scientists and the residents of Matriarch's Mercy, determine that a disaster will occur if they do.

It's now all gone.

Give it up for the future of \"accelerated quantum computing platforms.\" At least, that's how Nvidia's CEO, he of the signature leather jacket, Jensen Huang sees things. During yesterday's GTC keynote presentation , Huang explained how it was—who'd a thunk it?!—Nvidia GPUs that would unlock the potential of quantum computing. Huang outlined how the individual bits of quantum computing, known as qubits, are inherently unstable, only surviving for a few hundred operations. But \"solving meaningful problems requires trillions of operations,\" Huang said. \"The answer is quantum error correction. Measuring disturbs a qubit which destroys the information inside it. The trick is to add extra qubits—entangled—so that measuring them gives us enough information to calculate where errors occurred without damaging the qubits we care about.\" In this scenario, hundreds of entangled qubits combine to form a single, error-corrected logical qubit inside a QPU or quantum processing unit. The trillions of dollars Nvidia is worth thanks to AI are not enough for Jensen Hu…",

What if I told you there's a way to get around this in the Battlefield 6 battle royale Redsec, if only you show some restraint? It's only explained in a loading screen or in-game tip (if you haven't turned those off) that you can melee downed enemies to perform a shakedown . This will play a short takedown animation that will reveal the positions of any remaining squadmates, whether it's one lone straggler or three of them. It's easy to miss the prompt, so be careful not to do a standard melee swing, as that won't reveal enemies, and you risk outright killing the downed enemy instead. (Image credit: EA) The kicker is they'll be marked on your map, but also via in-world spotting, making it really easy to pin down and track the locations of their angry friends.

That's not all the exciting news about the Mounts of Mayhem drop either. Three news mobs have been shared in an official blog post , including one new mount and two new variants. They all spawn in the desert, and often come as a package deal rather than appearing separately, which is bound to make the usually barren biome a lot more exciting. As someone who usually avoids exploring the desert unless I really must, I'm looking forward to having a reason to, rather than aimlessly wandering. That's until I inevitably lose my inventory to its new inhabitants, of course. The parched is a new skeleton variant, but unlike their standard version they won't burn in daylight.
