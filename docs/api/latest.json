The Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC takes what we like about the standard V3 Pro, adds an 8,000 Hz polling rate, as well as TMR thumbsticks, and comes in at the exact same price. If you play on PC, and have the $200 spare to afford it, the V3 Pro 8K PC is a no-brainer. At 220 g, it's a bit lighter than you might expect (being around 60 g less than the Xbox wireless controller) but that doesn't mean it's not sturdy. Our Alex says this controller is \"solid all over\" and praises the texture grips and great build quality. That's not all Razer's latest has going for it though. It comes with programmable buttons, plus a sequence of back paddles, and the triggers can be adjusted to swap travel distance. If you like a long press from your triggers, flip it one way. If you want to click as quick as possible, flip it the other way. All of these little customization options, paired with Razer Synapse 4, makes this controller super adjustable and the super high polling rate can give y…",

But while the Ace is half the cost, it still sports a very steep price tag for a mere motherboard. So what exactly are you getting for $500 that you don't get with a $250 model? Let's start with the most eye-popping feature, the number of USB ports on the rear IO panel. At first glance, it would seem that you get four Type-C and 11 Type-A sockets for USB devices, but that's only half the story. Like many mainstream and high-end Core Ultra 200S motherboards, the MEG Z890 Ace sports two Thunderbolt 4 ports. These support up to 40 Gbps in Thunderbolt 4 mode, 20 Gbps in USB4 mode, or 10 Gbps when operating as USB 3.2 Type-C sockets, as well as providing DisplayPort 2.1 outputs. The other Type-C connections are 10 Gbps USB 3.2, but here's the really impressive part: So are all the other Type-A ports.

Duckov is actually a lot more forgiving than that, it just won't tell you so.

Unlike Payday, which has a much more grounded setting, Den of Wolves wears its sci-fi inspirations on its sleeve. Inspired by movies like Inception, The Matrix, District 9, and Elysium, sticking to sci-fi \"gives the opportunity to play around with stuff and think about what is fun,\" says 10 Chambers COO Svante Vinternatt. Still, \"the freedom we have with this sci-fi space is a bit terrifying,\" admits Anders Svärd, 10 Chambers' master artist. This futuristic shooter has a suitably futuristic locale: the dystopian Midway City, a lawless, corporation-controlled metropolis built in the middle of the Pacific ocean between Japan and the US. Taking visual cues from Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City, with buildings piled on top of each other, as well as Stockholm with its sea-level waterways, Midway is the perfect FPS playground.

Redditor The87Player has built something truly unique, a gaming PC with aged components crammed inside what looks to be a large plastic water jug, with six RGB-emblazoned fans socketed into the front. With one solitary exhaust fan at the rear and no visible ventilation anywhere else, I'd like to note. Luckily, the hardware inside isn't likely to cause too much financial distress if it melts itself into oblivion, as the whole setup is said to have cost €130. That's around $150, for those of you that only speak in God's own currency. Anyway, it's got a decade-old Intel Xeon E5-2673 v3 CPU at its heart, in combination with a luxurious 16 GB of DDR3 RAM (that feels weird to type at this point) and a GTX 960 trucking away in the GPU slot.

According to Caleb in a video posted today , the story increasingly goes that OLED is running out of time and will soon be replaced by RGB mini-LED technology. In part that's thanks to developments like Sony's decision to drop its top rung OLED TV in favour of RGB mini-LED tech and also Samsung's similar micro RGB TV tech . This narrative is likewise driven by the idea that OLED is difficult and expensive to make, which it is, and that consumers are increasingly preferring larger and larger TVs, which they are. That cost problem for OLED is only amplified as panel sizes increase. 85-inch plus OLEDs are crazy money. At the same time, there's the OLED brightness thing, with full-panel brightness remaining a fraction of that achieved by LCD TV with LED backlights. Oh, and the whole burn-in fiasco. Enter RGB mini-LED tech, which is being pitched as the next big thing. Bigger, brighter and plain just better than OLED. And exit OLED, right? As Caleb points …",

It's the best handheld gaming PC in many respects, but not really worth all that money, and while it's lacking in some key features, it's apparently easily upgradeable. This last point has come to light thanks to iFixit's recent disassembly of the handheld. The ROG Xbox Ally X has been given the teardown treatment, and it turns out it's surprisingly easily upgradeable, at least in some ways. This has earned it a 7/10 score from iFixit, which isn't quite the 10/10 it awarded the Framework laptop , but is still pretty impressive, especially for a handheld. It's also upgradeable in ways that should be very relevant to many ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X owners (presumably the same applies to the non-X version, too, even though that wasn't tested). This is particularly true when it comes to storage and thumbsticks. The $1,000 handheld comes with a 1 TB SSD, which is decent for a handheld, but if you're paying gaming PC prices for a handheld, more storage than this would be nice. Thankfully, though, the ROG Xbox Ally X has an easily-accessible M.2 slot, so you can swap it out with a new one of your ch…",

That's according to Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation, who says that over the past few months, the site has seen a \"decrease of roughly 8% as compared to the same months in 2024\" in human pageviews. After updating its bot detection systems, the Foundation \"found that much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.\" \"We believe that these declines reflect the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,\" says Miller, \"especially with search engines providing answers directly to searchers, often based on Wikipedia content.\" The AI answers that Google spits up top of the SERPs, in my experience, tend to reference articles from publications—such as yours truly—more so than Wikipedia.

One thing I do understand, though, is The Simpsons, which I was the right age to catch (at least as re-runs) back when it was still good. So even I raised an eyebrow, perhaps two, when leaks began swirling that the entire town of Springfield would be back in map form in Fortnite (via VGC ). That's per Fortnite Nostradamus/Deepthroat/leaks-person-of-note NotPalo , who wrote that Fortnite would be getting a cel-shaded map with separate sections for areas like the Springfield nuclear power plant. There'll also be Simpsons character skins (with, it's said, their own Lego versions for use in Lego maps), and a Simpsons-themed mini-season. Which is all very lovely, but let's cut to the chase.

One such candidate is the CEO of internet monitoring firm Catchpoint, Mehdi Daoudi, who spoke to CNN about the fallout from AWS' rather public faceplant. \"The incident highlights the complexity and fragility of the internet, as well as how much every aspect of our work depends on the internet to work,\" said Daoudi. \"The financial impact of this outage will easily reach into the hundreds of billions due to loss in productivity for millions of workers that cannot do their job, plus business operations that are stopped or delayed— from airlines to factories.\" While that figure initially seems excessive, when you take into account the scope of the outage, it's perhaps not too far out of th…",

(Image credit: Paradox) Bloodlines 2 has no gear system at all, so all of the outfits you'll collect are mostly cosmetic . That said, your threads are still helpful when it comes to feeding. NPCs react to what you're wearing, you see, and this matters when you're trying to collect blood resonance : that is, blood from people who are experiencing specific, strong emotions.

From there you're given a prompt on how to sail, but for the most part you just have to figure everything out: where to go, who you are, and who you've just pulled into your boat from the water. There is a significant lack of hand-holding throughout the demo, which is noticeable from the get-go. You're given visual clues to follow, such as red lights floating in the ocean, but aside from that you are left to your own devices. You do have an AI/co-op partner, though.

      "body": "The MSI MAG Z890 Tomahawk WiFi has been on the market for 12 months, as it was one of the first motherboards to be released alongside Intel's Core Ultra 200S range of desktop CPUs, aka Arrow Lake, in October 2024. At the time, there were few other models to choose from, but that's considerably changed over the months, and MSI faces stiff competition at this price point. The Z890 Tomahawk's original MSRP was $300, though you're more likely to find it around the $260 mark, and while that's not a huge reduction, it brings it more in line with boards from ASRock and Gigabyte. That's not the only thing that's changed since last year, as the performance of Arrow Lake has noticeably improved due to a wealth of microcode, BIOS, and Windows updates. In gaming, Core Ultra 200S still lag behind AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, though. MSI's Tomahawk series of motherboards has been around since 2018, as part of its budget and mainstream selection of products, sporting the MAG (MSI Arsenal Gaming) moniker. The Z890 Tomahawk WiFi sits near the top-end of the MAG pile, partly because of its price tag, but mostly because of the comprehensive array of features it has.

In the World of Darkness, the universe in which Vampire: The Masquerade is contained, romance is kinda complicated. More complicated than usual, I mean. This is because vamps aren't human.

While vampires can retain some of their humanity—which there's a system for in both the tabletop game and Bloodlines 1, but not the sequel—in most cases their former nature gets squeezed out by the Beast, the source of all their darker proclivities.

Telltale had been helping to keep adventure games alive after the genre fell out of favour, and now it was making the switch to something that looked like an interactive TV show.

I definitely recommend checking out for yourself, if that popularity has piqued your interest. As I said in my review, Ball X Pit is \"a roller coaster ride of ball-bouncing action that loves to break its own rules\". It combines Breakout-inspired action with Vampire Survivors-like roguelike progression and even a substantial city-building element between runs, and the result is an absolutely deadly 'one more run' effect.

A simple enough concept, but let's just say this one spiralled a bit. And then some. This incredible desk contains 74 hexagonal frames, 44 of which house 37 active RGB cells. Each multi-layered cell can display its status via perspex inserts and multiple LEDs (via Hackaday ). Between the cells are pathways along which the bees travel, again with RGB lights. All told, there are 3,745 LEDs. It's all controlled by software that Full Stack Woodworking also built. And the resulting bee hive simulation is utterly beguiling. But hold that thought, because this labour of love deserves describing. This is a hugely complex desk build. Just making the top layer of the cell frames from African hard wood was an incredibly involved process, requiring several steps to prepare uniformly thin strips of wood ready to be laser cut. Full Stack Woodworking worked three sessions a day making the top hex frame layer—before work, after work, and before bed. And it took 25 days to …",

Earlier this year it released its ninth expansion, Grasping Fortune, and now it's gearing up for number 10: Poison Song . This is a big one. Well, they're all big ones, but this is a big one for a new reason . Poison Song means players are finally getting \"one of the holy grails that TR players [have] been waiting for more than twenty years—the ability to join House Indoril.\" This is either the most hype-inducing sentence you've ever heard, or completely meaningless (if you are normal), so let me try to break it down. Base Morrowind let you join any of three different Houses—Morrowind-native political factions that, conveniently, pretty much mapped to each corner of the Fighter-Mage-Thief triad. There was Hlaalu, the Empire-sympathetic merchant guild; Redoran, the traditionalist fighter sect; and Telvanni, dickhead wizards who live in mushrooms.

Taro was shown an image of a signed copy of the Nier Reincarnation OST being sold on Vinted, a site typically used for more noble purposes, like reselling clothes or old books. Mind, flogging a signed something-or-other isn't inherently scummy (times are tough!) but what isn't great is faking the signature entirely. \"This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine,\" Taro says, before adding that \"I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.\" Oof. This has naturally led to a flurry of people asking whether or not their autographs are genuine, or sharing genuine ones—which sort of defeats the point, though I imagine ol' Taro switches it up from time to time.

      "body": "Chip manufacturing moving over to the US might seem like a 2025 phenomenon, thanks to the Trump administration's very vocal pushing towards this goal, but TSMC, the world's biggest computer chip manufacturer, approved production of its Arizona plant back in 2020. The US-based fabrication plant (fab) started churning out wafers last year, and it has now produced the first-ever US-made Nvidia Blackwell wafer . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, \"This is a historic moment for several reasons. It’s the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in the United States.\" And although Huang would, of course, say this about Nvidia's own chip, it is probably true that Blackwell is the \"single most important chip.\" That's because it's far and away the chip that AI datacentre companies are clawing for. TSMC Arizona CEO Ray Chuang expressed the importance of the recent Blackwell chip: \"To go from arriving in Arizona to delivering the first U.S.-made NVIDIA Blackwell chip in just a few short years represents the very best of TSMC.\" None of this is to say that the Arizona plant's…",

From the 8BitDo Retro keyboard and the Pro 3 gamepad, to the R8 gaming mouse sat under my palm, they all have a distinguished and unique look, but they're so much more than a retro facade slapped on top of any old peripheral. Though the 8BitDo Retro R8 owes arguably both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses to that commitment. The version I have my hands on is the N edition. Based on an old school Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, to you and me), it's covered in a pale, warm-toned grey colouring, punctuated with a smattering of reds and blacks, plus grey on the base. It's perhaps the most interesting-looking mouse I've tested in years, and the same can be said about the translucent green Xbox edition . The second you pick up this mouse, you will feel every one of its singular design choices. The ends are angular, rather than the grooves we've come to expect from most mice, and the left and right side-buttons are recessed into the frame of the mouse itself. That means you have to get leverage over the opposite side of the mouse to get enough space to jam your finger in. These side buttons …",

In my 92/100 review I practiced no restraint at all. \"In some ways N++ feels like the end of the action platformer,\" I wrote, \"like an exhaustive final document, a catalogue of its emotional highs and lows.\" I stand by those words mostly because, ten years later, I still play N++ occasionally.

The free update includes new levels for the solo, multiplayer and race modes, as well as six new color schemes and \"a few assorted bugfixes\".

Fleshlings have a variety of different gameplay effects based on the variant of the boss. For example, in one variant, Fleshlings spawn with Spikes.\" Hallow and Stryx become an alternate boss for Cael, in Ring 6 \"Stryx & Hallow are two se…",

      "body": "It was the Arc Raiders Server Slam over the weekend, but you probably already know that. Why? Because a frankly alarming number of people poured in to slam those servers, so odds are decent you're one of them. With the full version of Embark Studios' extraction shooter due out on October 30, its server test must have the devs licking their lips for a successful launch.
