But first, it's time to butter up executive producer Jonathan Nolan. Bethesda execs have previously spoken about how a Fallout adaptation could've come much sooner, except Howard didn't want the usual \"videogame directors\" to come in and make a hash of it . But Nolan, co-writer on the likes of Westworld, Interstellar, and the Dark Knight trilogy? \"It turned out he was a huge fan of Fallout,\" Howard told the BBC's Newsbeat , adding that the two have become \"very close friends\" working on the show. \"Everyone involved is on the same page with how they want to treat it with authenticity.\" That authenticity is what led to an early decision that the TV show would be \"canon\" within the Fallout universe.

The shopper in question goes by the handle BravoNorris, and had scooped up the last four available XPG Caster 32 GB DDR5-6000 CL40 kits from Adata, each containing two sticks of 16 GB memory. All were sold as new and sealed from Amazon Spain. After selling one, and installing another, BravoNorris opened a third box only to find the sticker scam in their hand. That's when they reached out to VideoCardz with the story . This third box was plastic-wrapped like the other three, and had shipped from the same point of origin in Ireland. However, this box contained two old sticks of DDR2 memory with DDR5 heatsink stickers that could fool someone only checking the product through the packaging window.

As you can find out for yourself by opening Steam and clicking the big \" Steam Replay \" button on the storefront, the percentage playtime spent by all Steam users in 2025 on games, released in the same year, was 14%. Valve doesn't share its exact working, here, but I'm happy to assume that the company makes an effort to bar completely inactive accounts in these tallies, because Steam's been kicking for over 22 years at this point—if it didn't, that number would be a lot smaller. I'm also made more reasonably confident by the fact that this is a pattern that's held (somewhat) stable for four years now—with only one outlier in 2023. As we noted last year , the historical data for this same statistic are as follows: Players spent 17% of their time on same-year releases in 2022… 9% in 2023 and 15% in 2024. With 14% of players doing so in 2025, it's starting to become a safe bet to assume that number will, on your average calendar year, hang around the 15% mark. As far a…",

Similar to Armored Transports , you also require a Blue Gate Communication Tower Key to even see the board in the first place, since it's inside a locked room. While there is a spare key you can grab on the way, it has a similar problem to Armored Transports—the one quest I have still not completed for this very reason. If you lose the key, it's basically up to RNG whether you get another, so you're a bit stuck. Luckily, the locked room at Pilgrim's Peak, where you have to go, has a lot more foot traffic, so chances are even without the key, you'll still be able to get it. No free loadout this time; you'll want a safe pocket to stow the key Apollo gives you until you need to use it. Otherwise, here's how to complete Groundbreaking, including where to find the locked room, and how to find the building pictured on the whiteboard.

But right off the bat in Fallout Season 2, Episode 1, we get to see a location I remember fondly from one of the Fallout games—and surprisingly, it has absolutely nothing to do with New Vegas at all. Thinking about it, this location is probably the place I've spent the most time out of all of the Fallout games I've played. When it showed up in the episode, I immediately got a buffout-sized dose of nostalgia. As the kids say, it hit me right in the feels. (Apologies if the kids no longer say this.) In Episode 1, Lucy and the Ghoul are following Hank's bloody footprints through the desert from California to Nevada, and they discover he made a stop at a location players of Fallout 4 are sure to recognize: the Starlight Drive-In Theatre.

Following Lucy and The Ghouls' journey to find her father and his family, the duo stumbles across tons of iconic Wasteland locations like New Vegas, a fan favourite Fallout 4 spot, Dinky the T. Rex, and one of the most mysterious cut locations from Fallout: New Vegas . I'm of course talking about Vault 24. Over the course of Fallout's life, there have been many iconic Vaults mentioned and featured in games. Many were the childhood homes of our protagonists and player characters—like Lucy's own Vault 33, or Vault 13 from the OG Fallout. But the vaults run the gamut from capsules of Americana to harrowing psychological experiments. Here are just some of the more interesting examples: Vault 4 (TV Show): In season 1, we saw Lucy and Maximus explore Vault 4, the previous home of a group of scientists who experimented with mutants and Wastelanders. Vault 11 (New Vegas): A social experiment took place to see how willing people would be to sacrifice others for the safety of the majority.

Case in point: Hank MacLean, played by Kyle MacLachlan in Prime Video's Fallout series. Hank is the ultimate business zealot. Before the bombs fell, Hank was so dedicated to his work at Vault-Tec that he voluntarily had himself cryogenically frozen for a couple centuries. He got thawed out, married a Vault-dweller named Rose, had two kids, and then murdered 30,000 people with an A-bomb. All in the name of business. And he was just getting started! In the final episode of Season 1, Hank saw his daughter learn what a monster he was, left her behind to mercy-kill her ghoulified mother, then stomped his way across the desert to reach New Vegas. As Season 2 begins we see that Hank has not been shattered by the consequences of his evil acts: he's actually invigorated and ready for more.

The topic came up in a recent interview with IGN , and Howard was pretty clear it's a 'no' from him: \"They've offered me a whole bunch, even in Season 1,\" says Howard. \"I was going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things.

This scene is one of the revelations that occurs towards the end of that season, and is a flashback to how Vault-Tec executives and various other business big-hitters divide the various vault experiments between themselves before they agree to drop the bombs.

By provoking controversy, Horses has clearly done part of its job as a work of art, although after playing it, I was disappointed that it didn't fully take advantage of its potential as a game. It's visually strong and thematically coherent, and a fascinating attempt to explore topics and tones in games that have often been reserved for film, but it struggles to integrate the experience of the player in a way that doesn't distract from its point. The horses are people, if you hadn't noticed yet In Horses, you play a young man, Anselmo, who's sent to stay and work for two weeks on a farm. The farm is populated mainly by naked humans wearing horse masks. Bad things happen on the farm.

It's not the Fallout you want (that'd be Fallout 5, which is most likely still another five or more years away), but this week there is an update to an existing, and very good, Fallout game of a different sort. (Image credit: Bethesda) Fallout Shelter , Bethesda's free-to-play base-building management sim, has been updated with Seasons, a new feature that introduces limited-time Vaults with new locations, scenarios, and characters. Naturally, the first season is called Viva New Vegas, and your new Vault (it's separate from your main game) is buried beneath the sands of Nevada near Novac. And if you play your cards right, you'll see some familiar faces appearing outside your Vault door. \"In Viva New Vegas, you’re tasked with recruiting loyal allies, bringing Novac under control, and transforming it into a shining beacon beneath the …",

While discussing VRAM and who gets to decide how much a card can have, Crisler said with a smile: \"I got to be careful of what I'm about to say here.

At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs.

So Microsoft boils it down, thus: Entry-level gaming (1080p, medium settings) CPU: At least a modern quad-core like AMD Ryzen 5 5600 or Intel Core i5-12400 GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1660 Super or AMD Radeon RX 6600 Mid-range gaming (1440p, high settings) CPU: 6-core or better, such as AMD Ryzen 5 7600 or Intel Core i5-13600K GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti / 4060 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT High-end/4K gaming CPU: 8-core or better, like AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D or Intel Core i7-13700K GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4080 or AMD Rade…",

So when ZSA offered to send over its Voyager keyboard, along with its new Navigator trackball module, I had high expectations. Essentially, the Voyager is a pared-down Moonlander, with all excess fat trimmed away to leave as minimal a keyboard as possible. \"Laptop-friendly,\" says ZSA's marketing. \"Goes anywhere—on your desk or on the road.\" I certainly can't argue with that because with just 52 keys and a total thickness of just 16 mm (0.62 inches), the Voyager is as whisper-thin as you could want. However, both the thickness and key count result in some notable compromises. For example, there's no wireless connectivity option because batteries would add to the weight, cost, and size of the keyboard. With such few keys, you have to make full use of the Voyager's layer system to access standard options such as function keys. On the plus side, the ZSA Voyager comes with multiple USB cables of…",

Amazon should know this well, having turned a bunch of The Rings of Power's second season into a weird rehash of Star Wars with Tom Bombadil as Yoda. And though I didn't hate the second season of The Witcher, it was a shame to lose the twisty structure of the first season's jumbled timeline, which relied on viewers spotting details to untangle which events took place when, and not gain anything nearly as thinky to replace it. So I went into Fallout Season 2 with concerns. For starters, I expected the pre-war flashbacks to become vestigial, hurried past to get on with the modern day story of Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Praise be to the Atom then, that the flashbacks remain central. Barb continues making moral compromises on behalf of her family and Coop keeps finding out about corporate shenanigans that force him to become involved. But usually the reason TV shows disappoint in their second season is, while the first season can focus on introducing the core cast, the second needs to broaden things to keep generating new story.

      "body": "Baldur's Gate 3's fully motion captured and voiced dialogue was the clearest sign that the developer had stepped into the big leagues after Divinity: Original Sin 2. The earlier RPG had great writing and voice acting for key dialogue, but it didn't pull you into the performances in the way BG3 would a few years later. Larian knows that's what people now expect from its RPGs, and it's already bringing actors into the studio to work on Divinity . \"We're still casting, but we already have a bunch of actors in,\" studio founder Swen Vincke told PC Gamer in an interview after The Game Awards , where Divinity was revealed. Unlike a film that's written first and then shot, Larian's creative process entails capturing its actors' performances as soon as development is out of pre-production. \"This gives you an idea of the ambition,\" he said. \"We built a huge studio in Guilford, with six recording studios in there. The idea is that these are going to be recording nonstop on this game, which gives you an idea of the ambition. It's big, because we want you to have lots and lots and lots of choice. This is a project where recording is almost at the beginning.\" Vincke didn't give even a rough est…",

We previously reported that Lenovo and HP had already warned customers of upcoming price hikes , while Dell will implement price increases of up to 30% as soon as December 17, according to Business Insider . Now, Commercial Times reports that both Acer CEO Jason Chen and Asus co-CEO Samson Hu have expressed that there is an industry-wide consensus that pricing will reflect spiking memory costs (via TrendForce ). Jason Chen told Commercial Times that once upon a time, memory only accounted for between 8% and 10% of the cost of a PC's Bill of Materials (or BOM). Between Q3 and mid-Q4 of 2025, memory prices rose anywhere between 30% and 50%, in turn seeing the overall BOM jump by between 2% to 3%.

It was previously thought that bad actors would need to control a much more significant percentage of any LLM's training data to influence its behaviour, but these recent findings suggest it's actually much easier than that. According to Anthropic, \"Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents.\" For those a little lost, 'poisoning' an AI can take a few different forms.
