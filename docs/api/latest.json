Lunar Lake in tablet form does very, very well, and its Arc 140V GPU is seriously impressive when it comes to gaming performance. And then there's that gorgeous, bright 11-inch display. But it's also flaky as all hell with strange bugs and, despite the whole reason for its existence being that it's supposedly a versatile 3-in-1 device, it resolutely fails to convince in pretty much any of those formats. Like the older, Meteor Lake-powered OneXPlayer X1 , this is a device designed to operate as a standard (although very thick) PC tablet, with a laptop-esque form thanks to its magnetically attaching keyboard and touchpad, and as a handheld gaming PC with a pair of clip-on controllers. And, inevitably, that desire for flexibility hobbles each option in different ways. I was genuinely hoping that things would be different this time around, but it feels like OneXPlayer has not learned the lessons from the original device and is determined to make the same mistakes. Though maybe that quest for versatility means avoiding those mistakes is…",

Gonzalez began by going into some detail on the elements he admired in the show's writing, before things took a rather more interesting turn. \"I really enjoyed the first season of the show,\" says Gonzalez. \"I thought there was some really admirable complexity in the way that they explored the world. I mean, I thought that the Maximus character is a fascinating creation, a fascinating slant to take you into the Brotherhood of Steel. I'm fascinated to see where it goes.\" Gonzalez then makes the dangerous decision to mention the topic of credit and residuals, comparing it to how many early comic book creators were treated: the likes of Bill Finger or Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko. \"It is very odd to see characters that I created showing up in other media,\" says Gonzalez. \"It's also something where there's no credit for that, there's no residuals for that.

It's a little more serious about the RPG part of the formula than I anticipated, so when the tutorials turned me loose, I'll admit it, I floundered. Fortunately, after countless trial-and-error crafts and plenty of mistakes, I've finally gotten the hang of it and feel ready to share a little forging wisdom. So if you're looking to climb the levels and become a master miner, I've got some tips for The Forge first-timers that'll carry you into the late game. Conquer objectives faster by picking up every quest you can (Image credit: FireAtacck / Roblox) Tons of quests in The Forge share overlapping objectives, and if there's a limit on how many you can have at once, I've yet to encounter it. Make your life easier by speaking to every NPC you can and accept whatever tasks they have for you. Most are easy and a nice introduction to the basics—like learning how to mine Stone —while others require quite a bit of grinding. Even as I write this, I have three active quests demanding I slay a bunch of Rogue Skeletons, but every skelly I crush with my ka…",

So it seems only fitting that the fan translators who did such a marvelous job with that game would wind up getting to do the same for another underappreciated cozy gem—only this time, with official backing. 1999's Milano's Odd Job Collection, out on Steam today , is the first 'legit' project from the fan translators at Hilltop Works, who teamed up with publisher XSeed and emulation-porting house Implicit Conversions to release the game in English for the first time. I think the background of how Milano ended up finally being released in English is maybe even more interesting than the game itself, given how rare it is for fan translations to get the official seal of approval.

According to an Embark X post , the Cold Snap update arrives Tuesday, December 16. According to Embark's official Arc Raiders roadmap , the Cold Snap update brings a new map condition called snowfall, the \"Flickering Flames\" event, a new raider deck (basically a battle pass), and new quests. Players have speculated about what exactly the snowfall map condition will entail (is it just the same maps but with snow?), but a teaser image shared by Embark today of a collapsed raider in the snow suggests the extreme temperatures will carry consequences. It looks like players might have to limit their exposure to the elements to avoid freezing to death, or perhaps toss an incendiary grenade to warm up. That's the most obvious way to make heat a factor of survival, but I wonder if Embark would go even further—what if wearing warmer clothes, like a fur jacket, increased your heat resistance? That'd instantly plunge Arc Raiders into the realm of pay-to-win cosmetics, so consider it unlikely, but it would be an interesting wrinkle. 16.12.25 pic.twitter.com/UxQH0nAP1L D…",

Warner, on the other hand, despite some recent major botches of its own, still brings significant gaming strength to the table. That doesn't seem to figure into Netflix's plans, though.

Before that, it made a reboot of Modern Warfare 3 in 2023 just a year after its reboot of Modern Warfare 2 (2022). The repetition has created a strong sense of fatigue among parts of the player base, which Activision cited (indirectly) as a factor of today's decision. \"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental.

Take a look at the announcement trailer: Those bizarre plants and animals aren't the only mutants: Sprout himself has \"a mystical and unique mutation that gives him the power to take and give life essence, shaping the world around him with every choice,\" says developer Tiny Roar. \"Sprout’s journey will grow into an epic adventure of survival and mystery as he seeks to understand the cause and purpose behind his mutation.\" And despite the rifle, don't expect this to be a real shoot-'em-up, as combat should be seen as a last resort. \"Weapons are rare and violence is a dangerous, inconvenient solution,\" says developer Tiny Roar. \"Your focus is on survival. The world reacts to how you move through it…",

Both expressed hope that GOG will be able to bring the games back at some point in the future, but the likelihood of a return is unknown.

PCG's Ted Litchfield recently spoke to a number of Bethesda worthies, including design director Emil Pagliarulo, and a common theme among all of them was admiration for the quality of the show. In most circumstances you'd put this down to company people saying the right thing about a company product, but the thing is that the Fallout TV show's first season was great . I ended up watching it with my partner, who isn't exactly into sprawling brown RPGs, and by the end she was enraptured by the depth and weirdness of this take on the post-apocalypse. \"It's really fascinating that the show is part of our lore,\" says Pagliarulo. \"It's connected to the games, it's by having the show set, I think it's nine years after Fa…",

But worst of all is an annoying stutter that I've encountered on PC. Every minute or two, my client will lock up for a handful of frames, a problem I haven't had once previously in 80+ hours of play. Battlefield Studios has acknowledged this new bug as well, and for now, one possible workaround is to shut down your Steam friends list (assuming that's the platform you're playing on). A workaround that seems to help some players on Steam is to go offline in the friends menu.

As noticed by MP1st , a new European trademark filing for something called Divinity was made today by a German law firm that's previously filed trademark applications for other Larian games.

Each day, customers will rock up and require your skills when it comes to their rundown electronics, and it's your job to fix them. This will involve taking them apart, cleaning them up, diagnosing and mending the issue before giving them back. These repairs look incredibly in-depth as well. It's not just a case of giving everything a good dust after you've taken its screws out; you really have to get into every nook and cranny.

However, it's quite a deceptive first look. Initially, I thought I was looking at a sweet bug-catching simulator, but it quickly pulls in dating sim elements in a significant change of pace. As you run around, you will in fact catch bugs, but it's what you do with them after that gets me excited to play. Once you've successfully tracked and captured your insect of choice, you'll get to pop it into a jar with another bug and watch what is essentially a first date play out. The example given in the trailer shows a butterfly and a slug coming together for dinner, but as you watch them interact it turns out there are by no means a compatible pair. So, it's your job as the bug catcher overlord to find the perfect match for each insect. As you watch these date sequences, bugs will express their likes and dislikes, such as a hard shell or a certain amount of eyes. You know, all those features you probably think of every…",

And after seeing its reveal trailer during the Wholesome Snack showcase, I can confirm it certainly looks like one of those games you'd play to completion and then cry your eyes out about. Though saying that, it might just be me: the trailer alone had me on the verge of tears. In the reveal trailer, we're welcomed to the setting of a summer camp called Camp Pals and given a brief look at what to expect from a day there. While exploring, you'll meet a cast of unique characters to befriend, but unlike what we're used to in a lot of other games, it won't be as straightforward as going up and introducing yourself. This is where the game's premise of finding new ways to communicate with other characters rather than just relying on dialogue comes in. From what we've seen in the trailer, this includes using communication cards dictating actions like \"play\" and \"dance\", or developing bonds by completing tasks for new friends such as finding a missing charm. It looks like there are plenty of activities to complete while you explore the camp too, such as pai…",

In a new trailer shown during the Wholesome Snack showcase, we get another look at its easygoing lifestyle through some sweeping shots of the towns you'll explore, alongside some familiar faces if you've been enjoying the game in early access. However, if you're yet to explore the world of Cozy Caravan, then you are in for a treat. But, before you can delve in, you need to make an animal avatar. Rather than this being your typical cat or dog, you're given a wonderful selection of critters to choose from too, including an opossum and raccoon, or even an axolotl if you're more keen on amphibians. Once you've made the impossible selection, you'll be unleashed into the game and get to experience what life as a mobile market is like. Unleashed might give the wrong impression, because Cozy Caravan is exactly what its title suggests: an incredibly relaxing game with little to no restrictions or rules. In fact, you use this caravan to set up a travelling market stall where you can stock items you've cr…",

Earlier today, players who've purchased non-deluxe edition digital copies of Resident Evil Requiem through the PlayStation store and checked for preload details were suddenly treated to updated cover art for the game. And that updated art just so happens to prominently feature our beautiful, spin-kicking son, Leon S. Kennedy. Here's a look: (Image credit: Capcom) Leon's potential inclusion in Requiem has been the subject of speculation since before its first reveal showed the blasted remains of his old Raccoon City stomping grounds—thanks in part to known RE leaker Dusk Golem , who's claimed that Leon is \"not the only playable character, but he is the main character.\" Until now, Capcom has remained thoroughly insistent that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, even as early demos left some of us—like PC Gamer's Morgan Park —with the distinct…",

While that change proved to be a great success in Path of Exile's sequel, it hasn't gone quite so smoothly for Riot, with initial fears that it would unbalance the game now mostly giving way to the opposite problem: players complaining that the controls suck to use. When Riot announced the change in a blog post in August, it framed it as a way to make the game more approachable. “We’ve seen that for new players, WASD is the most familiar control scheme for PC games today, and let’s be real, a lot of us instinctively put our fingers there when coming back to League after playing something else,” the developer said. “By offering WASD as an alternate control scheme, we believe League will feel more intuitive to some players who come from other games.” Soon after the announcement, players were already spiraling into doomsday scenario…",

The latest leakage comes by way of PEGI , the Pan European Game Information agency, which has helpfully provided an 18 rating for something called Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced. There's little more to be gleaned from the rating at this point, except that the game has violence, bad language, and in-game purchases.

This fascinating action roguelike feels like a modern spin-off of 2008 god game Spore. Starting as a cute little blob creature, your goal is to survive in an increasingly dangerous ecosystem. Initially you're easy prey, but as you eat food you level up, gaining new genetic traits and (hopefully) rising to the top of the food chain. (Image credit: Odd Dreams Digital) As I set out on my first few runs, what immediately impresses me is the sheer variety of different traits, particularly because a really large selection of them are reflected visually on my creature. I can cover them in scales, fur, or an exoskeleton; give them claws, poison spit, bull horns, or spines; make them huge and lumbering or quick and tiny; and much, much more. It all combines seamlessly, both visually and mechanically—whether I've built the ultimate predator, or (more often) one of God's mistake…",

HP estimates that memory accounts for around 15 to 18% of the cost of even a fairly standard PC, with CEO Enrique Lores already warning that the second half of 2026 will be a particular challenge pricewise (via Asia Business Daily ). Seeing as PC gaming is expensive as it is, knowing further price hikes are imminent is still a bitter pill to swallow. As such, some have not been shy to voice their displeasure, with Framework for one directly criticising Dell's price hikes. The modular laptop maker had previously delisted its own standalone memory to 'head off scalpers' , and more recently pos…",

It packs up to 2 TB of proper NVMe storage and runs at up to 3.7 GB/s (via Videocardz ). It's not even that outrageously expensive, for now. There is, however, a catch. It's a proprietary rather than open standard. What really marks this drive out from, say, the even smaller microSD format is the combination of performance and full NVMe 1.4 support. The CL100 measures 15 mm by 17 mm and fits into a slide-in tray that very much resembles a phone SIM tray. A microSD card is just 11 mm by 15 mm, but doesn't offer all the features and performance of a proper NVMe SSD. The Biwin CL100 does. At least, it offers the performance of an NVMe drive with a PCIe 4.0 two-lane interface. On the largest 2 TB model, that allows for maximum read speeds of 3.7 GB/s and maximum writes of 3.5 GB/s. For the record, the read IOPS are 550K, the writes 650K. Those are pretty comparable to figures you'd expect from a full M.2 drive with the same two-lane PCIe 4.0 interface.

The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix. So, in terms of HDR support, these are entry-level panels and won't have local dimming. It's also worth noting that t…",

Netherite horse armor takes a significant amount of work, but it's well worth it. If you're bringing the same horse out each time you adventure, you'll want to keep it safe, and given the fact netherite is the strongest material in the game, it'll more than do the trick. Unlike all other armor, netherite has no durability either, so you know that once you've made it, you probably won't have to again, which is a huge plus for the material. You can also equip it on any adult horse, including zombie horses, which come with their own added perk. So, if you're convinced to give the craft a go, here's how you can make it.

Working out how to craft a spear is incredibly easy, depending on which material you want to use for it, but it can be a little tricky to master its moveset.

But, much like a lot of Minecraft's underwater mobs, they can be quite challenging to track down, let alone tame. With how much of a Minecraft world is covered in ocean, tracking a Nautilus can seem quite intimidating. However, there's actually a pretty solid method you can follow if you're stuck on where to start looking. Here's what you need to do if you want to get an underwater mount for yourself, and how you can tame it once and for all. Where to find Nautilus in Minecraft Nautilus spawn in all ocean biomes in Minecraft, including frozen and warm, which makes the job of hunting one down a little easier. With that said, they don't appear at the surface, and you'll have to delve beyond level 38 to find one . Fortunately, they tend to spawn in groups of two or three, so if you find one, the chances you'll encounter a few extra to tame are high too.

Is it really a leak, or just an elaborate fake? It's looking like the latter, as Ys Net has posted a message on X saying the video \"has absolutely no connection\" to the studio. The \"work in progress\" video purports to be a recording of a display screen, rather than a direct capture, so the quality isn't great and, more importantly, it's trickier to suss out whether it's AI generated. But it has long-suffering Shenmue fans hopeful: It's been six years since Shenmue 3 dropped (which happened a full 18 years after Shenmue 2), and while Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has previously expressed a desire to make a new game in the series , there's been no movement toward that actually happening. It sure sounds like that remains the case. \"Ys Net Inc has confirmed that a video has been posted on social media which uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that it is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us,\" the studio wrote on X. \"This video has absolu…",

Developer Vedinad withdrew the game from contention in the Best Debut Indie Game category in November, revealing that it wasn't really a debut game at all: Vedinad has previously released games under other studio names. But two weeks later, it elbowed its way back— so back —in the Players' Voice category, which unlike every other TGA category is chosen entirely by fans. Well, the fans have chosen not to have Megabonk in the running for the Players' Voice category. This year's final nominees are: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Dispatch Genshin Impact Hollow Knight: Sliksong Wuthering Waves Clair Obscur might seem like the obvious favorite here, because it's the obvious favorite everywhere , but the fact that the Players' Voice category comes down to a public vote—that is, whichever community can most effectively rally its troops to the cause—really opens things up.

Path of Exile 2, however, could be the game at the end of Rogers' \"quest to make the perfect ARPG,\" he told PC Gamer in a recent interview. Despite its differences to PoE 1, some of which have gone away over the last year in early access, \"it was never really about making it feel distinct,\" he says. In the last year, Grinding Gear Games has been navigating the treacherous waters of making a sequel that veers pretty far away from the vibe of the first game. If PoE 1 is a rampage through thousands of monsters, PoE 2 is a dance with far fewer, but more threatening monsters—a fundamental shift in the feel of the game. And not everyone has been a fan of the pivot, especially when any class that feels remotely like PoE 1 inevitably gets gutted in a patch. PoE 1 veterans want to feel like gods and go fast in the new game; Rogers wants combat to feel methodical. …",

It was immediately clear that Wiebe loves Portal. He worked on the first iteration of Battlefield 6's level editing/publishing platform during Battlefield 2042 development, back when the toolset was, in his words, \"more like a Battlefield builder than anything.\" In that game, Portal was squarely focused on mashing up different eras of Battlefield. You could pit futuristic jets versus WW2 planes, summon bots, and tweak rules to your heart's content, but without complex scripting or the ability to place new geometry, its creative ceiling was low. \"The people were phenomenal at stretching what we had built to do some amazing things, but they had to really work hard,\" Wiebe told PC Gamer.
