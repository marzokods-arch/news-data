That's because the world finally has a feature players have been asking for since it first arrived in early access nearly two years ago: water. The Wake of the Water update arrived this week, bringing a new high-level biome to the already massive Embervale map. Veilwater Basin is a tropical jungle filled with lakes, waterways, and sunken ruins to explore, and the region is also perfect for building a new base because you can put all that water to use. Since Enshrouded's water is simulated in real time, you can dig canals for irrigating crops or powering new crafting stations, and you can move water around in containers to fill your own lakes and ponds. There are even waterproof walls included in the update if you want to build an underwater base—and something tells me you do. Just be careful: if you remove the wrong block down there, water will immediately begin flooding your submerged home. You're not the only one moving into Veilwater Basin. A lizard-like race called Drak are also elbowing their way into the region, and not only are they strong swimmers but they can use weapons underwater—unlike you. You might w…",

The ex Geralt never properly ended things with, and the canon love interest as book readers will tell you (it's me, I'm book readers), she complicates Geralt's love life and forces him to belatedly grow up—which feels thematically appropriate, as he retakes his place as Ciri's father figure over the course of the game. Yet that element wasn't always part of The Witcher 3. As Badowski says, \"It wasn't [there] from the beginning, but at some point we understood that this lack of kind of conflict, personal conflict—of course, there's Ciri—but there was a lack of something .\" As soon as someone suggested the idea of making players c…",

Today there are a lot more games there. We definitely feel that there are some really, really good co-op games out there right now. Helldivers 2, obviously, and lately we've seen Arc Raiders do extremely well.\" It's getting harder to predict what will pop off or stick around in the PC multiplayer space, which was much less crowded when Deep Rock entered early access in 2018.

      "body": "Nothing about PUBG and Subnautica 2 publisher Krafton's recent decision to become an \"AI-first company\" look good. The company plans to drop over 130 billion won ($88 million) into the project, recently stopped hiring new employees, and started a voluntary resignation program for its employees in South Korea this week. Far down the ladder from these decisions is Eleventh Hour Games, the developer behind Last Epoch, which Krafton acquired in July . The timing couldn't have been worse as it happened right after the founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds were unceremoniously fired for what they claim was a move to avoid paying a $250 million earnout. At the time, EHG founder Judd Cobler told fans of the budding action RPG that having a corporate owner would only benefit the game in the long run by giving them access to more resources and employees. Fans of the game were understandably skeptical about how the buyout would impact the game. That skepticism turned into outright worry when Last Epoch's first expansion, Orobyss, was announced during a Sony State of Play in September. Ever since the Last Epoch Kickstarter in 2018, EHG promised that once you buy the game, everything…",

The series started out great. It gave the stale and yet seemingly never-ending Alien saga something it really needed: a kick in the butt. Instead of just one Alien, it gave us a bunch of different types of aliens, including a weird eyeball creature that is both horrifying and yet kinda cuddly? Instead of a single android, standard for Alien movies, it also featured a cyborg and several synthetic people with human minds transplanted into them. And instead of a xenomorph slowly picking off people one by one from the shadows, this big alien boi was just right out there in broad daylight, mass-murdering entire groups of people in mere seconds like a buzzsaw.

The most popular ones simply won't work when Midnight arrives as part of Blizzard's plan to level the playing field for all players. Unsurprisingly, this hasn't gone over well with everyone. Some addon developers have called it quits , while others have expressed concerns over Blizzard's new rules. Professional world first raiders aren't sure what their jobs are going to look like in the next year and more casual players are worried their favorite classes are being over-simplified as a result. In a lengthy post about this new era of addon support, game director Ion Hazzikostas explains why any of this is happening now, what exactly is changing, and how things will move forward as the Midnight beta continues. \"We take none of this lightly,\" he says, adding that Blizzard has \"never designed [encounters] FOR addons,\" but it has \"inevitably had to design AROUND them for the past several expansions.\" Basically the problem was this: When a boss marks five players with ticking bombs, addons can just tell those people where…",

For more than four years, Romero has been politely but pointedly correcting every inaccurate memory and anecdote Petersen's shared on Twitter (now X) from his time working at id Software. Nearly each tweet begins with some variation of \"Hi Sandy, hope you're doing well\" before nuking the original statement from orbit. Petersen joined id during the development of Doom in 1993, working on several of the game's levels and designing more for Doom 2. He also worked on Quake before leaving the studio in mid-1997, about a year after Romero's exit. That makes for a good bit of overlap, though of course Romero was with id from the beginning, having co-founded the studio in 1991. Romero, notably, has talked about having hyperthymesia , which he credits for giving him a vivid memory. I don't know if his recall is perfect , but each time Petersen trots out an id…",

The only series in the style that's truly won my heart is Age of Wonders, the fourth of which you can try for free this weekend until Monday, Nov. 17. If you're not familiar, Age of Wonders marries the deep strategy of 4X to turn-based tactical RPG gameplay. It also grounds a lot of the map-painting in intuitive, tangible roleplay scenarios: You don't play a faceless nation, but a customizable ruler and culture, gathering magical artifacts, schools of magic, skills, and provinces as you explore the world. You can play as anything from classic fantasy dwarfs to gothic, power-mad molemen, and territory is won with turn-based battles made up of your custom troops. In his review , online editor Fraser Brown said Age of Wonders 4 \"demands to be played over and over,\" and I concur.

      "body": "Well, this is a strange one. Just minutes before it was set to deliver its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year, Ubisoft mashed the brakes on the whole thing, postponing the release of its results to an unspecified future date. The company also requested that European exchange Euronext halt trading of the company's shares and bonds from November 14 until the publication of its results. No reason for the postponement or trading halt was provided, but these things are rarely the result of good news.

      "body": "In October, PUBG and Subnautica 2 publisher Krafton announced that it would be undergoing a \"complete reorganization\" to become an \"AI-first\" company , planning to invest over 130 billion won ($88 million) in agentic AI infrastructure and deployment beginning in 2026. This week, as it boasts record-breaking quarterly profits, the Korean publisher has followed that strategic shift by launching a voluntary resignation program for its domestic employees, according to Business Korea reporting (via Automaton ). The program, announced internally, offers substantial buyouts for domestic Krafton employees based on their length of employment at the publisher. Severance packages range from 6 months' salary for employees with one year or less of service to 36 months' salary for employees who've worked at Krafton for over 11 years. The voluntary resignation program follows a November 4 earnings call in which Krafton announced a record quarterly profit of 1.052 trillion won ($717 million). During the call, Krafton CFO Bae Dong-geun indicated that Krafton had also halted hiring for new positions, telling investors that \"excluding organizations developing original intellectual property and AI-re…",

The Steam concurrents have dropped into the double digits and haven't had a noticeable uptick in several weeks. Over the last few months, however, Moonshot Games has been preparing a major update that could give it a second chance. On November 19, the Emergence update will finally give new players a mode that helps onboard them to the intricacies of joining a crew and flying a space ship. It will also include a mode that cuts out all the looting and focuses on large-scale ship battles. And a new alien prospector will join the roster with the ability to revive teammates.

The promotion is angled to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Ubisoft Connect, as shared in a blog post Monday. I mostly know the app as the cobweb-covered desktop icon I occasionally use to launch Steep or a Rayman game, or as the benign growth I find tacked onto any Ubisoft-published games I try to launch from Steam (a platform Ubisoft has unsuccessfully tried to jump ship from before), but I suppose I can't complain about the cross-play and cross-save.

It was a rip-the-band-aid-off opening for a presentation that quickly moved on to what Ghost Ship's doing in the meantime: launching a new season for Deep Rock Galactic, its first since 2024, while it continues work on the roguelite spin-off for next year. \"At Ghost Ship Games we've realized we can't have our cake and eat it at the same time, and do everything ourselves,\" Pedersen said. That's why the studio is following the Dead Cells playbook, partnering with another developer nearby in Copenhagen to create season six, which will come to Deep Rock early next year. The big draw for the new season is a spooky biome littered with the giant bones of ancient beasts, with a new enemy species to go with it. There are three types of Ossirans lurking in the Ossuary Depths, including a flying pest called the Scrab, the Pit Jaw, a \"living bear trap\" that can grab you if you walk over it, and the Bone Collector, which will pop up in other biomes.

It's not a new phenomenon; people have been complaining about graphics cards having just 8 GB of VRAM for years now. The problem really rose to the forefront with the RTX 4060 Ti , which initially launched with just 8 GB of VRAM to the chagrin of some . Nvidia then released a 16 GB version with a much higher price tag, which people also didn't like—many seemed to just want a 16 GB version with the 8 GB's price tag. The complaint is that 8 GB of VRAM isn't enough for gaming in 2025 in many cases. And this much is true for at least some games to run at higher settings, such as Hogwarts Legacy and The Last of Us Part 1 —this was resolved in The Last of Us Part 2 , though. Even when games don't seem to be trying to use more than 8 GB of VRAM, that might be because they're choosing not to stream as many or higher-re…",

It didn't work out so well back then, but this time , I think Valve has a real shot at finally decoupling a respectable chunk of PC gaming from Windows, if not the entire saucer section. Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: I'm considering whether I'd like a cube under my TV while hopping on a flight to help with the next PC Gaming Show, which airs December 4 . In 2017, I wrote a big report about why Steam Machines failed to take off, and the main thing Valve's hardware partners told me was that SteamOS just wasn't ready for the big leagues. The custom Linux distribution didn't support enough hardware or games, and only super-nerds had much enthusiasm for ditching Windows, especially as Windows 8 was being replaced by the much better-liked Windows 10. As a result, the original Steam Machines were never taken seriously as an alternative to desktop PCs or consoles like the Xbox One. Manufacturers started putting Windows on them to get them out the door. \"Nobody …",

Among other examples of heavy storage traffic, it turns out the AMD graphics driver is making hundreds of modifications to log files every time you move or resize a window. So, is the AMD graphics driver a clear and present danger to your SSD? Probably not, actually. Reddit user akia_Gecko has also uploaded a video to YouTube showing those log file writes by the AMD graphics driver in response to minor window movements. And it certainly looks pretty scary. As akia_Gecko says, \"every time you move a window or resize a window on your desktop, those files get modified multiple (hundreds!) of times.\" Of course, SSDs can be read almost indefinitely, but writes cause actual wear. Hammer an SSD with enough writes, and you'll kill it eventually. However, it does not necessarily follow that AMD's graphics driver will obliterate your SSD. Indeed, the AMD graphics driver probably isn't doing anything abnormal, because this kind of data logging is normal behaviour for a device driver.

For a second, it appeared on Dbrand's site a day after the Steam Machine announcement, with zero details other than a sign up form for email notifications and a smattering of \"coming 2026\" text, which suggests it's an idea someone might have come up with on the spot. However, The Shortcut says that Dbrand has already emailed about the case , and it really does appear to be in the works: \"After yesterday’s announcement of the Steam Machine, we asked our Industrial Design team the only sensible question: Can we turn this thing into a real-life Companion Cube?\" said Dbrand. \"Yes. The answer is yes. Even after accounting for the removable faceplate and air intake requirements, we’re confident it’s fully viable.\" Well, there you go.

There are many more reasons for that than Marathon, of course: Destiny 2 is in a big slump , while the studio has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs , and its CEO recently departed . But the mood music around Marathon is not great and with Concord in the rear-view mirror, one of the biggest live service flops in the industry's history, you sense a certain caution in the Sony executive suite. Marathon was announced with a (fantastic) trailer in 2023, but was indefinitely delayed earlier this year after \"passionate\" feedback. There was also, for good measure, a plagiarism scandal . Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao now says the company is \"fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule\" which means by March 2026: \"We will assume that we will launch this within this [financial] year, and that is …",

If you jumped at the opportunity to start customising your character with accessories like I did, then you'll be thrilled to hear this too. Both DLCs will add five remix tracks and ten accessories each to the game. The first will arrive this month, adding five Dance Dance Remixes to the game alongside its mystery accessories. And, outside of the DLC content, all players will receive a cosplay set for Saki Hanami from Idolm@ster, which is potentially one of the greatest outfits I've seen yet in Katamari. I hope this also means we can expect more cosplays in the future, as I'd probably sell my soul for a Miku outfit. With that said, this outfit in particular is only available for the Prince, so you won't be able to dress any cousin up in full cosplay. Again, I'm pretty hopeful this will change later down the line as well. However, the second DLC coming in winter will give every player a set of DJ accessories which aren't just …",

This is a long list of 100 games we're excited about. Some had fantastic teaser trailers, some have more Steam wishlists than ever believed possible, while yet more have flown under the radar of all but our most eagle-eyed writers and editors, and some are from fantastic developers who've already released our favourite games. That long list awaits you below, and you may notice there are fewer than 100 games on it this year. …",

The Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S are fantastic bits of hardware, but the closest device I've found to its dominance is the Pico 4 Ultra .

Death Stranding Isolations is the working title for the anime, which is due on Disney+ in 2027.

Hideo Kojima will act as executive producer on the series while Takayuki Sano, who has a list of anime credits longer than Kojima's Hollywood phonebook, is on directorial duties. The lovely art that accompanied the announcement is by Ilya Kuvshinov (Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045).

Not only did these donations not put a single dent in my stash, but I also didn't even have to play the game; I just clicked 45 times on the main menu.
