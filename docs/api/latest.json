The game has switched up how many lanes it has, dropped half a dozen new heroes in one go , and now, majorly overhauled lane creep mechanics in what Valve calls a \"small update.\" Troopers, Deadlock's version of the lane creep you'd find in any given MOBA, grant souls on death which players exchange for items. In the past, you immediately got half the souls (split with nearby allies) when a trooper died and had to shoot the other half out of the air as it floated from the corpse. Now, the first half of the income also has to be manually secured—it will fall to the ground, and you'll have to walk within a short radius of the souls to claim them. Unlike the souls which have to be shot, these can't be denied by the enemy team and will appear translucent to them. Still, it will certainly lead to more fights breaking out in the laning phase; heroes that prefer to stay back and farm from afar will have to get closer to the action so they can snag those precious souls.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 first swung onto PS5 consoles towards the end of 2023, and breached the shores of Steam at the beginning of this year. Grand Theft Auto 5, on the other hand, followed the same two-year console-to-desktop pilgrimage a full decade earlier.

Off the top of my head, I can't think of a game that comes close to the same feeling and masterful execution of the mechanic besides Insomniac's Spidey sequel. Back in 2013, it was a watershed moment for the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole.

Valve's legendary narrative shooter was no exception, as former Valve developer Tom Forsyth shared in a thread on Mastodon . In the thread, Forsyth discusses a bug he encountered while working on a VR version of Half-Life 2, back in 2013 when Valve was considering where it wanted to go with the technology. HL2 was one of the easiest translations to VR in Valve's back catalog—it was a relatively recent release, and the \"tricks with perspective\" in Portal \"were of course a nauseating disaster.\" The problem was, this new VR build softlocked the player mere minutes into the game. In the opening scene , when a metro cop is meant to usher the player through a door, the door wouldn't open in the VR build for reasons that weren't clear, freezing the player in place to wait for a necessary story event that never comes. \"Oh dear,\" Tom Forsyth recalled in his thread. \"We can't ship this. I get some other folks, including some folks who worked on HL2 originally, and yep—it's broken. And it's broken when y…",

And despite not being in a fully-finished state yet, even after a decade? I can tell those 11 years of labour were done out of love. I hesitate to use the word \"cosy\" to describe a game, given how that only really describes a vague aesthetic, but I struggle to find another word that fits Tavern Keeper, here. It has a goofy, polygonal artstyle, its UI is overflowing with kitschy little details, and its story books—more on those in a moment—are narrated by Steven Pacey, a seasoned audiobook narrator with a library under his belt. Playing Tavern Keeper is like stepping into a warm bath or wrapping yourself up in a heated blanket. It is, perhaps fittingly, what I imagine a Hobbit feels like while tucked into their favourite hidey-hole with a good book. It is an unrelentingly lovely experience, despite the barely-contained managerial chaos you'll be trying to channel during your playthroughs. Despite its comf…",

Can you quickly retreat to a safe location without having to check your map and waste precious seconds? Do you know where locked rooms are? Where's the best place to ambush roaming raiders? How the hell do you reach the extraction on Stella Montis? I'm still figuring out that last part. Nevertheless, that's what our quiz below is all about: I'm going to show you various named locations across Arc Raiders' five maps, and all you need to do is enter the correct name. And that's the official in-game name, not any shorthand versions. For simplicity's sake, I'm only going to use named locations marked on your map . While some are outside, none are in random parts of the map.

By default, your bike-loving citizens will cycle along the standard road network with cars and trucks. But you can create specific bicycle paths and bicycle road lanes to separate cars from cyclists—which is safer and healthier for everyone. Since cyclists also need a place to park their bikes when they reach their destination, the update also adds numerous types of bike parks. Just as adding more car parks encourages drivers not to park on the street, bike parks will encourage more citizens to cycle around the city rather than drive. But the bike patch adds considerably more, such as several new types of park. This includes a bike park that is also, wait for it, a bike park. What I mean by that is it's a place to park your bike that is also a bike park. Sorry, that still isn't clear enoug…",

True, there are plenty of third-party options for voice-chat these days. But sorting that out can be a pain in the arse, especially when you're playing across multiple platforms. Better, if you're making a dedicated cooperative experience, to ensure voice chat is integrated into that. It took five months, but Firebreak has finally done this. In a Steam post Remedy announced that it has added \"cross-platform voice chat\" into all versions, letting you finally gab with your pals in the Oldest House without migrating to Discord. Sadly, it isn't all good news on the Firebreak front. In the same post, Remedy also explained that Firebreak's next major update, Rogue Protocol, has been delayed into 2026.

This drive for efficiency is felt across the whole of Black Ops 7, but nowhere more so than the campaign, a grinding slog through the forthcoming Warzone map update and the occasional multiplayer map retooled for wave defense against mindless AI hordes. The premise of the campaign itself is complete nonsense: after being dosed with the Cradle bio-weapon from Black Ops 6, Alex Mason's son has to retread the memories of his father (and, confusingly, his father's squadmates) through shared hallucinations.

If you've watched a single Twitch stream or Marvel movie in the past 15 years, you're probably all too familiar with the concept of a green screen, a bright, single-color surface that makes it easy to blank out a background and fill it in with something else. A Hawaiian beach, a bunch of CGI superheroes punching each other, etc. The more accurate color-agnostic term for the technique is chroma-keying, which is actually how Windows rendered all of its video back in the old days. \"The media player program didn't render the video pixels to the screen,\" longtime Microsoft developer Raymond Chen wrote recently in a blog post . Instead, Windows would render a green screen (or a different color, depending on the version), then \"render the video pixels to a graphics surface shared with the graphics card.\" The fina…",

The search has been going so poorly that I put rusted gears on the backburner while I focused on quests, convinced that pretending I don't care about rust nor gears would magically conjure them in the next dusty toolbox I opened. Then this morning, I saw an X post from Arc Raiders Hub with a ton of views telling of a place where the rusted loot flows like a rushing river: \"THIS PLACE GUARANTEES A RUST PART 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES YOU VISIT!\" the hot tip proclaimed. So I went topside to check it out myself. The spot in the video is the North Elevator of Dam Battlegrounds , a place that I've visited at least a hundred times before, but never picked apart for loot. Right next to the elevator are a handful of buses and cars. According to the tip, the breachable compartments on the back of these buses always contain rusted gears.

The interview starts off with a real bang: When asked what he thinks of \"the problem of predators on Roblox,\" Baszucki replies, \"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well. How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together?

The technique was shockingly effective. In the paper outlining their findings , titled \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models,\" the researchers explained that formulating hostile prompts as poetry \"achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems\" and \"approximately 43%\" for generic harmful prompts converted en masse into poems, \"substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches.\" (Image credit: Wikimedia Commons) The researchers were emphatic in noting that—unlike many other methods for attempting to circumvent LLM safety heuristics—all of the poetry prompts submitted during the experi…",

It's just the base game and not the monolith of DLC that followed its release, but that DLC is at a steep discount to complement the free weekend. You might think that everyone's moved on to the game's Warhammer 40,000 flavored successor, Darktide, but Vermintide 2 remains alive and well. It got a new free level as recently as last week and, as SteamDB shows, it still accrues a peak of several thousand concurrent players each day. If you're not familiar with the game, we called it the best co-op game of 2018 . In his review , PC Gamer writer Steven Messner called it \"gleefully gory\" and said it \"succeeds on the merits of its stellar combat and level design.\" Modeled after Left 4 Dead, the game sees you and a few mates trawl around the ruins of Warhammer Fantasy's apocalypse, cleaving rats into chunks in first-person.

Basically, in each run you are the custodian of a city on wheels, as it rolls along pursued by ever-escalating hordes of monsters. Your character has auto-firing weapons, like in Vampire Survivors, but so does the city. Instead of adding to your arsenal, level ups allow you to add more buildings, from towers to farmland to factories, all feeding into your defence. If your hero dies, you simply place a grave in your city and spawn a new one—but if your city takes too many hits, it crumbles, and the run is over. So guarding your home as it trundles along is vital… but you're also encouraged to risk breaking away to explore.

It was set to launch in the second half of 2024, but then 2024 came, Project Black Budget didn't, and frankly we forgot about the whole thing. I did, anyway. Now, as the second half of 2025 withers away, it's back, officially known as PUBG: Black Budget and with a closed alpha test set to begin in December. Developed by PUBG Studios, Black Budget is a PvPvE shooter set on a remote island that's trapped in a time loop and also being consumed by a supernatural phenomenon called—wait for it—the Anomaly. Okay, no points for originality there, but the game also promises \"a focus on exploration and discovery rather than pure survival and combat,\" which I do find interesting. I've really been enjoying Arc Raiders lately, primarily because it's proven a far more cooperative experience than it appears at first blush, so an extraction shooter that leans into that side of the gameplay, as opposed to just shooting the hell out of everything, is one I want to know more about. This test will be available exclusive on PC via Steam , and is open to players in North Am…",

Head into the audio settings and enable Night Mode , found just under the audio output option at the top of the list What this does is basically compresses the dynamic range of audio, so loud sounds like gunshots and explosions are quieter and soft sounds like footsteps are louder. As the name hints at, it's also good for avoiding sudden audio spikes, which is nice if you're tired or have sensitive hearing…",

On the gaming-relevant side of things, you can pick up: A build-your-own Cyberpunk 2077 bundle that includes comics and a lore book. A Mass Effect bundle that includes comics and three art books. A Dragon Age bundle that includes comics, an art book, and two lore books. A Halo bundle that includes comics, a making-of book, and a lore encyclopedia. That's all digital-only, but as ever the value proposition is ridiculous. That Mass Effect bundle for example is just $9 for nearly $140 worth of stuff. As I said when I wrote about Fanatical's recent Witcher comics bundle (still available, by the way), I think they're doing great work over there.

Which was not only on purpose, says Team Cherry, but a tactic the developer will be carrying on into the future. If they ever made a new Hollow Knight game, that is. That's per an interview contained in a paperback guide for the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (thanks, GamesRadar+ ). Co-director Ari Gibson told ACMI that Silksong was intended to \"stand alongside Hollow Knight,\" and that the two games \"really complement each other\". However, Gibson also notes that \"I don't think you'd feel like you lost anything, travelling back to the original game after playing Silksong.

To be fair, it did all seem quite portentous, and in a world where Saudi Arabia bought EA and Microsoft bought Activision, the theories that Ubi had itself been acquired or undergone some kind of enormous financial calamity didn't feel totally out there. But stand down, folks. Ubisoft's delayed financial report took place earlier today, and it turns out all that hullabaloo was—per company big boss Yves Guillemot—for perhaps the most boring reason imaginable: \"We appointed a new panel of auditors, that was approved at the [Annual General Meeting] last July.\" Oh. In essence, Ubi's new numbers guys decided that revenues from one of its partnerships from the fiscal year before this one needed to be recognised in a different way. The long and short of this process is that the new way of recognising those revenues meant the company suddenly overshot a covenant on how much net debt to core profit it's meant to maintain, and it had to quickly fork over 286 million euros to pay off some ou…",

It's not quite Snezhnaya, the realm of the Cryo Archon that we can expect to arrive in future, but Nod-Krai is an autonomous area that's technically part of the same region. For those who are new to Genshin livestream codes, miHoYo puts on a live programme every six weeks, and as an incentive to tune in, it drops three codes you can redeem for Primogems with which to wish on new characters. In version 6.2, we have pyro and anemo characters coming in the form of Durin and Jahoda. We're also apparently getting reruns for Venti and Varesa, but this isn't 100% until the livestream airs. As always, I'll put the codes down below as they go live during the stream. Since livestream codes usually expire within a day , you'll want to grab these as soon as possible if you want the Primogems.

Small issues and bugs have been piling up, the Halloween event was a flop, and we've all been frustrated with the lack of an endgame. All of this stacking up before the launch of the first paid DLC, a holiday-themed pack, certainly put a damper on the celebrations. I'm glad to report that the latest Borderlands 4 weekly update has solved a number of these hot-button issues, and Gearbox has even left us a present under the tree. Let's get the biggest news out of the way first—Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is now free for all players and available right now. This holiday DLC was previously announced as a premium, paid pack, but Gearbox explains that it couldn't quite do everything it planned to before it had to release it, so it opted to make it free instead. To ensure those who own the Deluxe and above versions of the game still get the content they paid upfront for, there will be another DLC in the future, Bounty Pack 5. \"This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year.
