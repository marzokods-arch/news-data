      "body": "American automakers who got overenthusiastic about electric vehicles continue to pay the price—literally. Yesterday, General Motors told investors that building and selling fewer EVs will cost the company $6 billion. Still, things could be worse—last month, rival Ford said it would write down $19.5 billion as a result of its failed EV bet. GM is not actually abandoning its EV portfolio, even as it reduces shifts at some plants and repurposes others—like the one in Orion, Michigan—into assembling combustion-powered pickups and SUVs instead of EVs. The electric crossovers, SUVs, and pickups from Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC will remain on sale, with the rebatteried Chevy Bolt joining their ranks this year. But GM says it expects to sell many fewer EVs than once planned. For one thing, the US government abolished the clean vehicle tax credit, which cut the price of an American-made EV by up to $7,500. That government has also told automakers it no longer cares if they sell plenty of inefficient vehicles.

James \"JD\" Polk, NASA's chief health and medical officer, told reporters Thursday the crew member is \"absolutely stable\" but that the agency is \"erring on the side of caution\" with the decision to return the astronaut to Earth. The ailing astronaut is part of the Crew-11 mission, which launched to the station August 1 and was slated to come back to Earth around February 20. Instead, the Crew-11 astronauts will depart the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming days and head for reentry and a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.

Fleming's tool would record everything done on the target device, and the videos would be uploaded to a server where they could be viewed by the pcTattletale subscriber. This might sound creepy, but it can also be legal when used by a parent monitoring their child or an employee monitoring their workers. These are exactly the use cases that were once outlined on pcTattletale's website, where the software was said to have \"helped tens of thousands of parents stop their daughters from meeting up with pedophiles.\" Businesses can \"track productivity, theft, lost hours, and more.\" Even \"police departments use it for investigating.\" But this week, nearly 25 years after launching pcTattletale, Fleming pled guilty in federal court to having knowingly built and marketed software to spy on other adults without their consent. In other words, pcTattletale was often used to spy on romantic partners without their knowledge—and Fleming helped people do it. Read full article Comments",

      "body": "When it comes to cognitive ability, not all dogs are created equal. Most dogs can learn simple action cues like “sit” or “down.\" But so-called “gifted word learner” (GWL) dogs exhibit a remarkable ability to learn the names of objects—for example, learning the names of specific toys so well that they can retrieve them from a large pile of toys on command. And according to a new study published in the journal Science, they can even learn labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. Per the authors, this suggests that GWL dogs have sociocognitive skills that are functionally comparable to those of 18-month-old human toddlers. Co-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the Genius Dog Challenge . For instance, the group’s 2022 study discovered that dogs store key sensory features about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also…",

While the chatbot claimed that xAI supposedly \"identified lapses in safeguards\" that allowed outputs flagged as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and was \"urgently fixing them,\" Grok has proven to be an unreliable spokesperson , and xAI has not announced any fixes. A quick look at Grok's safety guidelines on its public GitHub shows they were last updated two months ago.

But mixing generative AI technology like ChatGPT with health advice or analysis of any kind has been a controversial idea since the launch of the service in late 2022. Just days ago, SFGate published an investigation detailing how a 19-year-old California man died of a drug overdose in May 2025 after 18 months of seeking recreational drug advice from ChatGPT. It's a telling example of what can go wrong when chatbot guardrails fail during long conversations and people follow erroneous AI guidance. Despite the known accuracy issues with AI chatbots, OpenAI's new Health feature will allow users to connect medical records and wellness apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal so that ChatGPT can provide personalized health responses like summarizing care instructions, preparing for doctor appointments, and understanding test results.

In the UK, Switch 2 sales were down 16 percent compared to the original Switch during the last eight weeks of the year.

The Swedish automaker has adopted some of the latest trends in electric vehicle design for the EX60, like a structural battery pack and the use of very large castings. As always with automakers teasing a new car, concrete details are only emerging slowly ahead of the official reveal on January 21, but we can say that range and recharging speeds were a priority during the design process. \"With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car. The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety,\" said Anders Bell, Volvo's CTO. Volvo says that its SUV will be best-in-class for range, which means 400 miles (644 km) from a fully charged battery under the EPA test cycle (although an official EPA range number isn't due yet). Fast charging should also live up to the name. Providing you plug into a 400 kW DC fast charger, the EX60 should add 168 miles (270 km) of range in 10 minutes, although we don't know how long it requires to fast charge from 10–80 percent.

At CES 2020 , Ars Technica reported that Ballie was “the furthest-along concept” that Samsung demonstrated. At the time, we saw Ballie use facial recognition to follow its owner. A marketing video also portrayed the robot controlling smart home devices, including activating a smart vacuum when someone made a mess. Ballie rolled back onto the trade show scene at CES 2024. This time, it had a new, more spherical and larger build rolling upon its three wheels. Ballie also sported a light ring, and Samsung showed a video of the robot being used as a projector. The South Korean firm claimed that Ballie would provide “two to three hours of continued projector use” before needing a charge. Samsung's video also demonstrated Ballie connecting with a smartphone.
