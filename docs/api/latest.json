That said, I don't really care that much because Larian has confirmed the only news that matters. When asked about the way defences would work in Divinity, head of design Nick Pechenin explained that it would \"not keep the magic armor system from DOS2\", and that's music to my ears. Comment from r/Games For the uninitiated, Divinity: Original Sin 2 split protection into two categories: physical and magical. The problem is that these were effectively two different additional health bars for enemies, weakened by two entirely separate types of damage, and you'd need to break at least one.

As reported by The Register , Linux kernel engineer for Oracle, Lorenzo Stoakes, recently critiqued Torvalds, arguing that AI tools are not the same as any other tool and need unique documentation and flagging. Stoakes then replied to Dave Hansen, kernel hacker at Intel, saying, \"We're noticing a lot more LLM slop than we used to. It is becoming more and more of an issue.\" Stoakes argues LLMs have had a negative impact in many areas, \"for which you need only take a cursory glance at the world to observe\". Furthering this point, Stoakes says, \"Thinking LLMs are 'just another tool' is to say effectively that the kernel is immune from this. Which seems to me a silly position.\" This is where Torvalds comes into the conversation . He says, \"No. Your position is the silly one. There is *zero* point in talking about AI slop. That's just plain stupid. Why? Because the AI slop people aren't going to document their patches as such. That's such an obvious truism that I don't u…",

Embark Studios hasn't confirmed a roadmap for Arc Raiders yet, but there are some things we're very likely to see, at the very least, before 2027 creeps up on us. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Following on from the last few months, I'd bet that raiders will get to experience new map conditions, weapons, arc mobs, raider decks, and hopefully even some new community events. When it comes to map conditions, I wouldn't be surprised if we got a desert condition sometime in the summer, like the Cold Snap , but in reverse. I'd also like to see something like a Wacky Raid, where the arc behaviour is really weird, the mobs spawn in locations you'd usually not find them in, and the loot makes absolutely no sense for where you'd find it. It sounds fun (and horrifying) finding a leaper wedged into the hallways of Dam Control Tower, although that's likely a pipe dream. But you know what isn't? New mobs. From the beginning, pl…",

The Epic Games Store, the Xbox App, Ubisoft Connect, the EA App (why does every publisher have an app?), none of these platforms come anywhere close to matching Steam's generally stellar experience. That being said, a lack of real competition is the root of complacency, and I for one would like to see Steam continue to improve, especially as it invades the living room with its second and much more promising attempt at the Steam Machine . So, I rallied some PC Gamers, we bashed our heads together, and came up with a list of nine things we'd like Steam to add in 2026. More detailed options for Steam reviews Can you guess the game?

There was an immediate and intense reaction as fans wondered what this meant for the studio's future games. Would Divinity be stuffed with AI slop? Would it be built with gen AI trained on artwork of dubious provenance? Eventually, Larian promised a Reddit Q&A session to give players a bit of transparency into the studio, its processes, and how it's using AI. Or how it's not using AI, I guess. As was prophesied, Larian kicked off its Q&A —with Vincke and a load of other studio honchos—earlier today. One key takeaway? Larian's swearing off using gen AI tools in concept art development. \"First off—there is not going to be any gen AI art in Divinity,\" wrote Vincke. \"I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration.

The first came in for criticism from progressive voices over representation and its depiction of the conflict between the Czech protagonists and their Cuman enemies, while the second game managed to upset the opposite end of the political spectrum by featuring gay romance and positively portrayed Romani, Jewish, and Muslim characters. For its part, Warhorse is rather tired of talking about it. The studio told us last year that it was \"fed up\" of being dragged into culture wars and wanted only \"to make a cool videogame,\" but when I got the chance to chat with Martin Klíma, studio co-founder and KCD2 executive producer, about KCD2 taking PCG's 2025 GOTY award , I had to take a second to ask: did he think the controversies actually impacted the series at all, in terms of sales, reception, or developer morale? Klíma said that, really, it was difficult to tell. \"I would really, really like to know the answer to this one,\" he said. \"You can really convincingly argue both ways.

The just possibly good news is that, in a new interview, AMD has left the door ever so slightly ajar for that happening in future. For many, the frustration is that many of these new upscaling features can be made to run on RDNA 3 graphics and indeed, community-based hacks have achieved just that , albeit with mixed results. So why won't AMD give that effort some official support? Speaking with PC World , Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President at AMD and the guy responsible for various driver features, including FSR upscaling technologies, explained that the lack of official support for the latest FSR tech on RDNA 3 basically comes down to the difficulty in delivering a consistent experience.

Project Patchouli from designer Yukidama is a project to \"build your own EMR tablet from scratch\". As helpfully laid out in Yukidama's YouTube video , an EMR tablet is one that uses Electromagnetic Resonance that sends a signal to a tablet, which is then translated by the tablet. It's a quick and responsive bit of technology, but different pen vendors work off different frequencies, which can impact compatibility. The video shows how electromagnetic pencils have coils and capacitors near the tip; a test board picks up that frequency and uses a signal amplifier to send that information to a computer. With an oscilloscope, Yukidama measures the frequency of each pencil as it touches the board, and then that frequency as they press harder. Two different pens register two different frequencies. This project uses a smart array of coils in the tablet itself, making it \"compatible with most commercial pens from different vendors, offeri…",

      "body": "Intel went on record at CES about a planned version of its new Panther Lake chip specifically configured for handheld gaming PCs but didn't provide any details. Now Videocardz claims the chip will be branded \"Intel Core G3 Extreme\" and have the same iGPU as Panther Lake in laptops. That means the Core G3 will get the same 12 Xe3-spec graphics cores as the top-spec Panther Lake chips for laptops. However, the leak claims that some concessions have been made to squeeze Panther Lake into the handheld form factor. On the iGPU side, it's said that clock speeds have been reduced from the 2.5 GHz of laptop chips like the Core Ultra X9 388H to 2.3 GHz. No doubt the idea is to reduce power consumption without noticeably impacting frame rates. That slight reduction in clock speed has apparently been enough to have Intel rebrand the iGPU from Intel Arc B390 in the top laptop variants of Panther Lake to Intel Arc B380 for the Intel Core G3 Extreme. As for the CPU of the Panther Lake package, that's had a bit more of a haircut. The full-spec Panther Lake configuration in the aforementioned Core Ultra X9 388H has four Performance cores, eight Efficient cores and four Low Power Efficient cores. …",

CES 2026 (Image credit: Future) Catch up with CES 2026 : We're on the ground in sunny Las Vegas covering all the latest announcements from some of the biggest names in tech, including Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Razer, MSI and more. Now, I know it wasn't AI all the way down. There was still plenty of delightful CES weirdness in the form InWin's fresh signature chassis that looks not unlike a futuristic glass egg , as well as yet another rollable laptop concept machine from Lenovo . I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention at least one questionable consumer doo-dad too, such as Lollipopstar , a lollipop that attempts to turn \"candy into a concert in your mouth.\" No, I will not be elaborating further.

Researcher and developer Jenny Guanni Qu recently looked at the Linux kernel's bug fixes and found tons of them stick around for a very long time. As someone who feels the allure of Linux distributions and occasionally succumbs to it before quickly scarpering back to Windows when confronted with bugs—usually small and irksome ones, but occasionally catastrophic —this information does not help me. So if you're the same as me: you're welcome. Qu built a tool to filter through Linux kernel changes and used it to filter for every fix since 2005. \"Six hours later, I had 125,183 vulnerability records.\" Looking at these fixes, she found that the average lifetime of a bug, ie, a bug existing and potentially causing problems for users, was 2.1 years over the 20-year time frame.

      "body": "We first reported on rumors of a new Witcher 3 DLC back at the tail end of 2025, after a Polish financial analyst and a known leaker said separately that a surprise new expansion is in the works. And while that DLC remains firmly in the realm of hopes and dreams for now, with a new year now upon us I am here to tell you that the foundation for that rumor has grown somewhat stronger. There are two big reasons for this. The first comes from IGN Poland , which said earlier this week ( Google translated ) that it first heard about this new expansion, \"from someone who has repeatedly provided us with reliable insider information,\" years ago. IGN Poland said it didn't publish anything about it at the time because the information all came from a single source (that's how actual journalism works), but in light of these new rumors it's opted to make the story public. IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could succ…",

I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows. Watching a clip of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay, the impact sounds were pretty jawbone-rumbling.

Except, that is, for monitors and what looks to me like the most exciting gaming display of 2026. I give you the LG UltraGear Evo 39GX950B , all 39 inches of it. This new gaming monitor has so much going for it. It gets LG's latest OLED panel tech (albeit minus the RGB-stripe subpixel layout ) and a 5K2K native resolution. That's 5,120 by 2,160 pixels. It's basically a 4K 16:9 pixel grid taken out to 21:9 aspect ultrawide. More specifically, it's essentially a 32-inch 16:9 monitor stretched out to 21:9. That means the 140-ish DPI pixel density is the same as a 32-inch 4K panel. Personally, when it comes to the best compromise between crispy precision for day-to-day computing and maybe creative workflows, overall panel size for immersion and tolerable GPU load for gaming, 32-inch 4K makes more sense than 27-inch 4K. The latter has better pixel density, for sure. But that's barely noticeable for games, and yet you will feel the smaller, less immersive panel size. And 32-inch 4K is still pretty sharp and offers really nice fonts …",

It's safe to say that this success came as a surprise to the at-the-time solo developer Daniel Knight. Now a team of over 30 developers known as Kinetic Games, the studio has revealed the launch of its new publishing label, aptly named Kinetic Publishing. Having learned a great deal about indie game development over the last five years, Knight, now the CEO of Kinetic, believes it's time to put that experience to use to help other independent developers. \"The fact we’ve grown so much as a company means we’re now in the place where we want to support studios who come under our wing, and provide the support I'd have appreciated at the start of my journey\", says Knight .

But the studio's big moment went awry just days later when Vincke said in a Bloomberg interview that Larian was experimenting with generative AI in the early stages of game development, and that developers at the studio were happy about it.

While it'd be hard to think of a Fallout game without VATS underlying it, linking gunplay to the classic RPG elements of its predecessors, Fallout 3—the first Fallout game after Bethesda acquired the licence—almost threw the gunplay out with the… uh, gunwater. I've lost track of this metaphor. That's per an interview in the latest issue of Edge (thanks, Gamesradar ). Speaking to lead artist Istvan Pely, it was revealed that \"there were some significant challenges figuring out VATS. There was a long period where it was like, 'Is this even fun?

And if that new dog should happen to pop into existence already next to another dog of the same type, and start off a chain reaction of merges that jostles the whole pile around into an avalanche of yaps… oh boy, that's doggy heaven. Dogpile wisely doesn't overcomplicate that core joy. The format is simple. Each hand, you draw three dogs from your deck, and choose where to drop them into the pit. (Image credit:…",

But here we are, CES in January 2026, and Intel's new Panther Lake chip isn't just the most exciting launch. It's virtually the only launch. Nvidia is obviously utterly consumed by all things AI, plus maybe a touch of memory crisis management. So, there were no new GPUs from Team Green . And AMD had nothing but respins of existing products . I suppose you could point to Qualcomm's second-gen Snapdragon X2 chips as something exciting. But the whole Arm-on-PC thing still has so much to prove, the jury isn't just out, it hasn't even been vetted yet. Which leaves Intel and Panther Lake. Being pretty much the only genuinely new PC chip at CES means you could get the impression it wins the excitement prize simply by default. It comes first in a race of one, in other words. Strictly, that's true. But Panther Lake is also genuinely exciting for several reasons. For PC gaming, it's the new Arc B390 iGPU that's most compelling. Intel is claiming up to 70% more performance than its previous-gen Lunar Lake iGPU. And Luna…",

However, Panther Lake's official launch at CES has given both Intel and AMD ample room to take potshots at each other. Talking to Tom's Hardware , AMD SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, spoke about Panther Lake. Tikoo said \"Strix Halo or Ryzen AI Max will kill it\" and that \"it's not even a fair fight at that point.\" He added that AMD's top-end chips are \"better than that in terms of graphics performance\" and that those looking for gaming will be buying gaming-specific chips anyway. In terms of performance, Tikoo points out Intel's benchmark results for Panther Lake were compared to lower-end and older Ryzen chips: \"They compared their highest-end to our midpoint.\" Earlier this week, Intel reported that its Core Ultra Series 3 Panther Lake chips are up to 77% faster in regard to gaming performance than Lunar Lake.

To begin with, Samsung's full earnings guidance offers the estimated range of \"19.9 trillion to 20.1 trillion Korean won\" for operating profits and \"92 trillion to 94 trillion Korean won\" for sales. Yeah, okay, that is still a lot of won. The guidance goes on to note that only offering ranges doesn't square with Korean disclosure regulations, hence the '20 trillion Korean won' figure.

Question, will that tech appear in a PC monitor any time soon? The answer is yes and no. Yes, the technologies seen in the new panels are headed for PC monitors. But, no, you can't expect to see PC monitors anything like that bright. One useful reference point here is that existing TV OLED panels are already rated at up 4,000 nits, with these new-gen OLEDs bumping that up to 4,500 nits. Existing OLED monitors, meanwhile, get nowhere 4,000 nits, typically topping out at 1,300 nits. So, OLED monitors based on a given equivalent generation of panel technology are much less bright on the desktop than their TV compatriots. We'll come back to the reasons why, but let's just cover off what the two big panel makers announced at CES this year. Samsung's latest QD-OLED panels aren't a radical departure.
