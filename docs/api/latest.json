I have been to a match (big up the Buccaneers), cheered in a crowd, and even gotten myself a special novelty hat, all without a single lick of game code actually dedicated to it. The Etheirys Blitzball League (also known as the EBL) is a roleplay community that hosts and runs in-game tournaments of the fantasy sport.

Gnomes are great; they're literally just weird little guys, and BG3's gnome characters are some of its finest.

And if you like what you see, Firaxis' turn-based tactics sequel is also on a 95% discount for the next week plus change. What is there to say about XCOM 2? Well, it achieved the seemingly impossible, improving upon X-COM: Enemy Unknown . Firaxis' refinement of Julian Gollop's groundbreaking original seemed like a perfect distillation, retaining the essence of what made Gollop's game great—the tension, the heartbreak, that feeling of squaring off against overwhelming odds—while also ironing out many of the kinks present in that original design. But then along came XCOM 2. Firaxis' sequel upped the ante from defending Earth from alien invasion to liberating it from alien occupation, recasting your organisation as a scrappy guerilla unit fighting a totalitarian regime from within. It introduced stealth to missions, letting you get the drop on xeno soldiers, and transformed your base into a flying fortress that could travel across the geoscape. It al…",

Barking.\" But for the sake of a peaceful life, you don't. Instead, you sit there, quietly seething. When you move out, though, all bets are off, and you can tell everyone who lives nearby exactly how you feel. And I've never seen a moving out message sent quite so spectacularly as by Rust player and reddit user UniverseBear, who constructed a giant, illuminated middle finger to say sayonara to his server buddies. As seen in UniverseBear's reddit post , the flashing flip-off is emblazoned on the side of a rectangular tower built from corrugated iron and concrete. The offending gesture itself is constructed from industrial lights timed to cycle through an animation where the middle finger slowly raises from a clenched fist. It seems this is something of a tradition for UniverseBear, a way to cap off a round of Rust when the server is due to be wiped. \"Making one of these is often how I like to end a successful wipe,\" he wrote, before detailing how exactl…",

Sci-fi Shooters 2.0 is a two-tiered bundle, and there's good reasons to shoot for either of them. Paying the minimum price of $14 (£12.51) will net you four games, namely Doom Eternal . Prey: Digital Deluxe Edition , Black Mesa , and FPS roguelite Battle Shapers . I'm not hugely familiar with Battle Shapers, but the other three games are, in my opinion, must-play experiences. Doom Eternal is still the best single-player FPS you can play today, a spellbinding iteration of id Software's 2016 Doom reboot that rewards mastery of its rich combat system in a manner unlike anything I've played before or since. Even last year's Doom: The Dark Ages , which I enjoyed very much, cannot compete with the ferocious pace and intensity of Eternal's combat. Then there's Prey, which isn't really a shooter even if it technically qualifies as one. It is, however, a…",

In The Outer Worlds 2, which I finally got around to playing this week after hearing great things , I don't feel like a real person while moving around. I feel like a camera, perfectly hovering in place and magically stabilized as I plop one foot in front of the other. It's as if Adam Jensen installed gimbals in his eyeballs. I'm talking about headbob : the subtle camera movement of first-person games that mimics the body's natural bob as it walks or runs. Headbob is so established and omnipresent in first-person games that it's rare we have an occasion to acknowledge it. When headbob comes up, it's usually because a game has too much of it. The Outer Worlds 2 has no headbob. Zero , unless you're sprinting. Your neck is totally detached from the motion of your body, and it's driving me up the wall. It's distracting, ugly, and comes off as a totally unforced error. I didn't realize just how necessary head jostling is to beli…",

Anthropic's adverts criticise ads being introduced to ChatGPT, and describe it as a \"betrayal\" of users. I regret to inform you all that the irony metre has officially smashed. It has gone off the scale. First thing to say is, the ads are also good: I'd recommend watching one or two first, while thinking about OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's face the first time he saw them. To take one example, embedded above, an AI user asks a bot (a middle-aged woman, in the ad) how to communicate better with his mother. When he asks what to do if the advice doesn't work out, the \"AI\" recommends a site for dating mature women where \"cubs\" can find \"cougars.\" Each ad ends with the same sting: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\" As if it couldn't get better, this is backed by the refrain from Dr Dre's What's the Difference, which goes \"What's the difference between me and you?\" Look, I know it's marketing, I know they've \"won\" by ge…",

Botany Manor is a cozy first-person puzzle game that casts players as botanist Arabella Greene, who despite her apparent retirement is exploring a Victorian manor in the late 19th century in order to complete her botanical research book.

People will glom onto anything and everything that seems to be even tangentially related to Half-Life 3, and the latest rumour doing the rounds was no exception. The Valve fan account GabeFollower posted a new YouTube video claiming that this time it was actually, definitely happening, including a claim that the project is so done-and-dusted that Valve had begun moving its devs onto other projects. So far, so Sunday morning, though for whatever reason this claim was picked up and reported on by several outlets. Now: any games developer reading the above is probably laughing themselves silly.

The introduction of perks and Stadium last year, alongside map voting and hero bans , was massive for the game.

Enter sodium-ion batteries. As reported by Live Science , a new experiment performed by researchers at the Tokyo University of Science has yielded promising results. Lithium-ion batteries work by using a graphite cathode to store the charged lithium ions—this is what actually causes your battery to be charged. Sodium ions need hard carbon instead, and previously, it was found that the sodium ions got jammed when trying to flow into the porous material.

If you go straight to Josee the Blind Hero like I did, you might be a bit underleveled for the fight. You can grind and come back later, but it is possible to beat Josee as soon as you open her cocoon. It just takes some practice. Here's what you need to know to slay Josee the Blind Hero in Code Vein 2. Josee the Blind Hero phase one (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Before getting started, make sure you bring De-Snares to this fight. Josee's attacks can inflict Bind and trap you in place. Getting stuck is a death sentence. Josee uses a massive katana that can cover most of the cramped boss arena in a single slash.

That key can then be used to decrypt files. It's like someone who spots you removing your lock from a locker and putting theirs on instead. Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back.

This week: Stopped being blissfully unaware that a TV sequel to Baldur's Gate 3 was in development. Baldur's Gate 3 is too big for Hasbro to leave alone. We already knew that, despite Larian moving onto greener pastures, Wizards of the Coast and its owner wanted to do a sequel, and we'll almost certainly see a sequel. But first we're getting a TV show , and I can't help but think that's a big mistake. Canon is a weird concept for D&D because it's an entirely player-driven experience. In the Forgotten Realms there are some big, immutable events, like the Time of Troubles, when the gods temporarily became mortal, or the chaos caused by the Absolute, but within those events are countless stories authored by players, a million headcanons and narratives forged around the table. (Image credit: Larian Studios) Any direct sequels, then, should take that into account, respecting and reflecting the potential choices we made in its predecessor, allowing players to contort the world so it fits their previous personal adventure.

'Obsession' isn't a strong enough word to describe my last three weeks with this bizarre roguelike strategy game/cat breeding simulator. Its core loop—taking adventuring parties of feline warriors out to face the dangers of the neighborhood, returning with the spoils (or four dead cats), and managing your household to raise a new generation for the next expedition—has kept me enthralled for 100 hours and counting.

Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed. A more grounded (literally) take on the classic FPS formula that, to me at least, felt far more like a spiritual successor to the legendary 1993 original. And now, thanks to id Software's 35th anniversary celebrations, Doom: The Dark Ages is over two-thirds off.

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules. As the memory supply crisis went further and further into the red, it became clear that a VRAM-stuffed Super refresh in the coming months was unlikely. The RTX 50-series cards we've tested to da…",

Deadline also reports that the writer and producer has been playing D&D weekly for the past 15 years. Aside from The Last of Us, Mazin is known for HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, as well as a handful of comedy films, including a couple of the Scary Movie parodies and the second two Hangover movies. According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3. The original BioWare RPGs are \"not official source material,\" the site says, but the show can use material from D&D's Forgotten Realms setting in general.

Ki is effectively your stamina, and you'll soon be breathless if you start flailing around as the samurai. So much so that I barely used the warrior early on in favour of the ninja, where I simply overwhelmed the enemy with a flurry of attacks and dodged here, there, and everywhere. The Ki Pulse is how samurai manage their stamina, requiring you to press the right bumper on a controller at the correct time during combos to recover Ki. It's a lot to keep track of, and it doesn't lead to very smooth, impactful samurai combat if you can't do it right. Plus, I'm a sucker for odachis—large, Ki-eating swords—so I was burning through stamina after just a few hits, leaving me defenceless.
