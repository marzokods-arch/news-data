With such runaway memory prices, it's hardly surprising that sales of have seen a dip as a result—or that some folks are not even opting for last-gen hardware, but extremely old CPUs to make the most of last-last-gen memory. To be clear, DDR4 memory pricing isn't much more sensible than DDR5; according to TrendForce's latest report , \"the average spot price of mainstream chips (i.e., DDR4 1Gx8 3200 MT/s) has increased by 9.64% from US$25.407 last week (Jan.7) to US$27.857 this week (Jan.14).\" A near 10% price increase in just one week is huge. Understandably, many buyers are opting to hold off on upgrades, resulting in sluggish sales for both DDR5 and DDR4 memory. That's left DDR3 motherboard sales to take centre stage instead, apparently increasing between two and three times in the Chinese DIY market alone. Boards bundled up with 6th to 9th Generation Intel CPUs are apparently also getting a lot more attention (via Videocardz ). Supply has a huge impact on memory pricing. In the aforementioned case of DDR5 memory, there's less to go round in part thanks to the AI industry buying up a whol…",

Perlman is a very well known actor, with dozens of television and movie credits going back to the 1970s, but he's also very prolific as a voice actor in animation and videogames. Mobygames lists 33 titles with a Ron Perlman appearance, including Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, Halo 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, and of course the Fallout games. His turns in Fallout are especially interesting because they're his most iconic videogame work, and yet it's only four simple words: \"War. War never changes.\" The intro to each Fallout game spins off differently from there, but those four words are an essential pillar of the series, every bit as thematically foundational as power armor or Nuka Cola.

If you're thinking \"hold on a minute\" that's probably because you remember a time when Rockstar and Take Two weren't so happy about modders: Indeed the publisher accused FiveM of hosting code to \"facilitate piracy\", and banned three of the main creators from Rockstar games. This policy changed in 2022 as Rockstar eventually woke up to how massive, forward-thinking, and potentially profitable the whole modding and roleplay scene was. It then allowed non-commercial roleplay servers, as long as they didn't interfere with any official services, before moving on to just acquire Cfx.re outright. The new Cfx.re is a \"curated digital storefront\" that will offer assets, scripts and maps to players, and will host both free and paid-for content.

They'll be in the overworld, which—given it makes up most of the game—can't be too challenging. But if the overworld is boring, then people will… y'know, get bored. If I'm asleep at my keyboard for eight out of 10 hours, that's not exactly great design. This is something the Elder Scrolls Online has been struggling with for years—and, alongside plenty of other things, it's finally being addressed. Towards the tail-end of Season 0 of its new seasonal structure, the game will be getting overworld difficulty functions.

Oh, and The Elder Scrolls 6 is bubbling away in there somewhere. It doesn't feel like a lot of space to launch a humdinger of a Fallout remaster, is my point. But fans of those games are quite keen on the notion of prettied-up versions, and a recent Steam glitch had a few of them ready to declare that the prophecy would soon be fulfilled (by which I mean: a remaster or two were imminent). Fans over on Reddit have noticed something hinky going on with Fallout 3 and New Vegas over on Steam.

That'll a be a huge, 50-storey, fully-carpeted yep according to YouTuber DocJade . He decided that installing and running the construction and management simulation game, Factorio , on a hard drive, like a normal human, is far too straight forward. So, why not use 3.5-inch floppy disks. Like, over a thousand of 'em. This immediately throws up almost countless problems, starting with the circa 1.5 MB capacity of a double-sided variant of such a disk and the fact that they're not made any longer. That's before you even think about the technicalities. Factorio is a very small game by modern standards, taking up about 1 GB to 1.5 GB of storage space once installed. But that's absolutely massive if a floppy disk is your metric. Cost is an immediate problem, with 10 old-stock floppies apparently costing about $23, you're looking at about $2,500 in floppies adding in some spares. In the end, DocJade managed to source 1,250 disks from floppydisk.com for an undisclosed pr…",

Or, as Kath puts it, a team with a \"mandate of: Let's find out what everybody wants to do, and let's do that.\" Some of these planned changes have been a long time coming, and while it can be easy to wonder why a team might drag their feet on such tweaks, Giacomini explains that a lot of these fixes have been a thorn in the developer's paw for a while, as well. \"We communicate with our players, we read, we listen, we play the game—it wasn't like we were blind to the things that players were …",

Enemies don't have health, they simply are a number—as low as one or, in my experience so far, as high as 55 (terrifying!). To kill them, you need to generate an attack that meets that number exactly—only an 11 will beat an 11, or a 23 for a 23. In other words precision, not power, is king. (Image credit: Filiokus) Each round you roll a set of dice and draw a hand of cards. Dice slot into spaces on the cards, which add or subtract from their result in different ways. All cards with dice currently slotted contribute to your total attack number—once it's where you want it, you can launch it and destroy an enemy. It's partly a game of maths—faced with a set of numbers and modifiers, you're looking for the most direct ways to reach specific results. But it's also about resource management. With only so many dice and slots each round, the trick is using what you have as efficiently as possible. (Image cre…",

However, you won't have access to Memories immediately. You've no doubt seen the prompt in the inventory screen to 'find the Forgotten Temple'—yeah, that's for the Memories. Since it's a progression system based on exploration, I recommend you unlock it as soon as you can, so here's what you need to do. How to unlock Memories at the Forgotten Temple in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) First you have to unlock the Memory system, which requires you to find the Forgotten Temple. There are multiple dotted around the map, but in my experience, there should be a Forgotten Temple near where you first spawn, which will be marked on your map with a portal icon. Head inside the building and take the stairs down behind the altar, where you'll find an earthen golem guarding a portal. The golem is easy enough to kill with copper weapons and armour, but if you don't have them, you can ac…",

That's where the backpack upgrade comes in, letting you handily increase your inventory size. Chances are, you've inspected your inventory and seen the small prompt about the backpack upgrade next to your character, but have no clue how to get or use it. I'll go over all of that below, as it's not even clear how the backpack upgrade works once you've crafted it. How to craft the backpack upgrade in Hytale (Image credit: Hypixel) You can unlock the backpack by crafting the upgrade in the 'tinkering' section of the Workbench.

As entertaining as Robb and Hansen's well-established rapport is, the full 40-minute interview is also eye-opening . For a start, while we already know AI is a big reason why we're experiencing a supply crisis , Robb eloquently communicates the sheer scale of the industry's hunger for memory. He puts it in stark terms for Hansen, \"The AI companies bought, like, 40% of the wafer production. We're not even talking finished goods, like, packages—not even chips. They're just wafers.\" And what's even wilder is that a lot of that stock may not even be in active use, instead hoarded in storage as the industry struggles to find sufficient power to fit out functional data centers.

Also, Arc Raiders developer Embark is still lukewarm on the stuff despite controversially using it during its development cycle. Larian, ostensibly one of the more influential studios out there, got thrown in deep water for AI use during concept art iteration and then decided to not do that , despite continuing to tinker in other areas. How useful this tech actually is on a practical level (you know, when software companies aren't mandating employees use it or complaining that nobody likes it ) remains to be seen. Stellar Blade director Hyung-tae Kim reckons he knows the future, though, speaking at the 2026 Economic Growth Strategy briefing on January 9 (thanks, Automaton ).

When the company increased prices for laptop memory late last year , it managed not to crank up Desktop and Mainboard prices. But no longer. In an updated blog post , Framework says that memory prices from its suppliers \"continue to increase rapidly\". Apparently, 128 Gbit chips have been hit hardest by the price spikes. And it's those chips that go into 128 GB configurations. And thus it's the 128 GB option that's been hit hardest. By way of example, until these price changes, Framework was charging $799 / £799 for a 32 GB Framework Desktop Mainboard with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 chip . Now it requires $839 / £839, so not too painful a premium. Step up to the 64 GB variant with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395 and $1,299 / £1,299 has become $1,339 / £1,339. Again, that's not entirely catastrophic. So, the real pain is reserved for the 128 GB option with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395. That was $1,699 / £1,699. But it's now $2,159 / £2,159.

One such player is Tfue . For those who don't know, Tfue was a Fortnite streamer, and a very popular one at that. He decided to retire or take a break back in 2023, but has since popped up again solely to stream Arc Raiders. (Image credit: Embark Studios) The sin that Tfue committed? He was one of the many raiders who accessed the console command exploit. During a stream , Tfue's chat was pointing him towards this exploit that could remove any shadows from the map, which he then tried out in the training range and on Stella Montis. From what I've seen, that's all Tfue did—he just walked around Stella Montis, talking about how bright everything looks and then dipped.

(Image credit: Prime Video) It's only on screen for a second, but the following pops up: \"F.E.V. (Forced Evolutionary Virus) is the gene-altering… agent for organism supercharging. The following is a…\" Unfortunately, Norm doesn't get to see any more as he's rudely interrupted by an unsettled Ronnie McCurtry, who fries the terminal and then attacks Norm. We won't see the fruits of this virus, at least not yet, but it does play a massively important role in Fallout's story, so for those who are curious, or again, nosey, let me explain what exactly FEV is and what its purpose is in the Wasteland. FEV is an artificial virus created before the Great War by the defense contractor and research organisation West Tek, in its …",

If the last episode of Fallout Season 2 left you hoping for a knockdown, dragout fight with a deathclaw, I've got some bad news for you. After not one, not two, but three deathclaws make a dramatic entrance on the New Vegas strip, Lucy and The Ghoul make a wise but fairly unexciting decision, and one we've all made when encountering a big monster in a game: they just sprint past them and load into a new map. Despite the lack of a battle, it is nice to see typically too-cool-for-school Ghoul absolutely terrified, and we know why: he was maybe the first person to ever see a deathclaw in the wild in Alaska, and even after 200 years they still make his irradiated blood run cold. It's not a great sign for New Vegas that deathclaws have moved into the Strip, though on the other side of the fence at least Freeside is looking busier and more bustling than it ever has. Those deathclaws are now between The Ghoul and Hank MacLean, who's holed up in the secret management Vault-Tec vault The Ghoul has never managed to find—the one he believes contains his missing wife and daughter. So, now what? \"You can't just waltz past a pack of de…",

No matter what, that's a remarkable achievement for a game that was all but dead and buried just a few months ago. And after spending some time today in Hytale today, I can already see the years of work that went into it. I can also see, as the devs warned us before launch, that it's got a long way to go.

I found a hefty deposit early on, and I've smelted it all down into iron ingots for making fancy weaponry and armor. If you're in the same boat, don't worry—I'll set you on the easier path to survival with a quick rundown on how to get iron in Hytale , including what you'll need to mine deposits and process your ore haul. Where to find iron in Hytale Look along cave walls for small deposits of iron. (Image credit: Hypixel Studios) You can find iron in Hytale by exploring underground caves in any of the Emerald Grove biomes. I found plenty of iron deposits close to the entrance of a few deep tunnels near where I spawned in the grassy meadows. It also seems like the deeper you go into the caves, the more iron you'll find, but be prepared for tougher cave-dwelling monsters and pitch-black darkness. It's also pretty easy to get lost, so take extra care if you're still in the early game. I've died to just as many spiders as bears thanks to \"just one more node\" greed.

The classic desktop designed for mouse and keyboard was gone, based on a prediction that soon everyone would want to use all their devices in the same way (this has still not come to pass). At the same time Microsoft's UI designers performed an all-time beefing-it maneuver, its business geniuses rolled out a new Apple-inspired Microsoft Store and method of locking down apps that spurred Valve's Gabe Newell to declare \"Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space\" and start investing into Linux development.

      "body": "I remember the days of other children on the playground telling me I could 360 in a zombies map to get the ray gun. These sorts of 'hacks' never worked, unfortunately. That's why I felt a twinge of scepticism in me today when I spotted this report from IGN pointing out players on the Arc Raiders subreddit found you can magically get better aim by cranking up your fps. But I've tested it, and it's true. This saga all started when a viewer of streamer Nickmercs noticed Nick's aim snapped onto Arcs (the bots in the game) as he was shooting. Nick uses a controller, which is key to the whole affair. After some took to accusing the previous Faze member of cheating , others discovered that the aim assist for controller players appears to be stronger in Arc Raiders, the higher your fps is. With the PC Gamer RTX 5070 Ti rig, I set everything to low, dynamic lighting to static, and resolution to 1080p and managed to get up to 300 fps without frame generation. It's possible to cap the frame rate in the game's settings, so I have all I need to test this theory out. I discovered that Reddit is actually right about this one. Shock horror, I know. At 300 fps, I discovered a few quirks when it co…",

If you've dodged the spoiler so far and want to go into the next episode of Fallout innocent, turn away now. Everyone else, come revel in the absurdity. Minor spoiler warning (maybe, I guess??) for Fallout season 2 (Image credit: Prime Video) Images of Funko Pop's new line of figures based on Fallout season 2 have started to pop up online, and they appear to spoil a pretty major part of the Legion plotline (spotted by Eurogamer ). We first get to see the Legion towards the end of episode 2 when Lucy leads an injured slave back to the barracks, where what remains of Caesar's troops are split in two, warring over the next rightful successor. This is also where we meet Macaulay Culkin's character Lacerta Legate for the first time. We then leave the Legion in a state of disarray in episode 3 . After the Ghoul rescues Lucy by bargaining her life for the whereabouts of NCR's last camp, the pair leave the barracks only for some explosives to go off (presumably set by the Ghoul), triggering an all-out war between the two…",
