With such runaway memory prices, it's hardly surprising that sales of have seen a dip as a result—or that some folks are not even opting for last-gen hardware, but extremely old CPUs to make the most of last-last-gen memory. To be clear, DDR4 memory pricing isn't much more sensible than DDR5; according to TrendForce's latest report , \"the average spot price of mainstream chips (i.e., DDR4 1Gx8 3200 MT/s) has increased by 9.64% from US$25.407 last week (Jan.7) to US$27.857 this week (Jan.14).\" A near 10% price increase in just one week is huge. Understandably, many buyers are opting to hold off on upgrades, resulting in sluggish sales for both DDR5 and DDR4 memory. That's left DDR3 motherboard sales to take centre stage instead, apparently increasing between two and three times in the Chinese DIY market alone. Boards bundled up with 6th to 9th Generation Intel CPUs are apparently also getting a lot more attention (via Videocardz ). Supply has a huge impact on memory pricing.

Perlman is a very well known actor, with dozens of television and movie credits going back to the 1970s, but he's also very prolific as a voice actor in animation and videogames. Mobygames lists 33 titles with a Ron Perlman appearance, including Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, Halo 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, and of course the Fallout games. His turns in Fallout are especially interesting because they're his most iconic videogame work, and yet it's only four simple words: \"War. War never changes.\" The intro to each Fallout game spins off differently from there, but those four words are an essential pillar of the series, every bit as thematically foundational as power armor or Nuka Cola.

Sure, we were more than a little disappointed by the relentless march of AI announcements , particularly in a show with \"consumer\" in the title, but we still managed to find a host of gaming gear to get excited about. It wasn't the richest of years for PC gamers, but hey, you can't win 'em all. Below, I've listed all nine of our Best of CES 2026 award picks. Despite all the AI tomfoolery, we still managed to scythe our way through the inference stacks, agentic nonsense, and the odd weird sporting tie-in to find gaming gear worth shouting about, and you'll find the cream of the crop right here. We've picked out some exciting new Intel chips, some monitor tech that looks to make a real difference to the way we display our games, a mahoosive graphics card, and much, much more.

The news comes three years after Rockstar's 2023 acquisition of Cfx.re, a Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption modding team, which also runs the roleplay servers FiveM and RedM. If you're thinking \"hold on a minute\" that's probably because you remember a time when Rockstar and Take Two weren't so happy about modders: Indeed the publisher accused FiveM of hosting code to \"facilitate piracy\", and banned three of the main creators from Rockstar games. This policy changed in 2022 as Rockstar eventually woke up to how massive, forward-thinking, and potentially profitable the whole modding and roleplay scene was. It then allowed non-commercial roleplay servers, as long as they didn't interfere with any official services, before moving on to just acquire Cfx.re outright. The new Cfx.re is a \"curated digital storefront\" that will offer assets, scripts and maps to players, and will host both free and paid-for content. Rockstar now hopes to give creators a place to share and sell their work, such as props, scripts, maps, \"and much more.\" (I…",

They'll be in the overworld, which—given it makes up most of the game—can't be too challenging. But if the overworld is boring, then people will… y'know, get bored. If I'm asleep at my keyboard for eight out of 10 hours, that's not exactly great design. This is something the Elder Scrolls Online has been struggling with for years—and, alongside plenty of other things, it's finally being addressed. Towards the tail-end of Season 0 of its new seasonal structure, the game will be getting overworld difficulty functions.

Oh, and The Elder Scrolls 6 is bubbling away in there somewhere. It doesn't feel like a lot of space to launch a humdinger of a Fallout remaster, is my point. But fans of those games are quite keen on the notion of prettied-up versions, and a recent Steam glitch had a few of them ready to declare that the prophecy would soon be fulfilled (by which I mean: a remaster or two were imminent). Fans over on Reddit have noticed something hinky going on with Fallout 3 and New Vegas over on Steam.

He decided that installing and running the construction and management simulation game, Factorio , on a hard drive, like a normal human, is far too straight forward. So, why not use 3.5-inch floppy disks. Like, over a thousand of 'em. This immediately throws up almost countless problems, starting with the circa 1.5 MB capacity of a double-sided variant of such a disk and the fact that they're not made any longer. That's before you even think about the technicalities. Factorio is a very small game by modern standards, taking up about 1 GB to 1.5 GB of storage space once installed. But that's absolutely massive if a floppy disk is your metric. Cost is an immediate problem, with 10 old-stock floppies apparently costing about $23, you're looking at about $2,500 in floppies adding in some spares.

It's surprisingly bold, then, that upcoming game Talystro turns that entirely on its head. On this little mouse's quest, the goal is instead to make specific numbers. Enemies don't have health, they simply are a number—as low as one or, in my experience so far, as high as 55 (terrifying!). To kill them, you need to generate an attack that meets that number exactly—only an 11 will beat an 11, or a 23 for a 23. In other words precision, not power, is king. (Image credit: Filiokus) Each round you roll a set of dice and draw a hand of cards. Dice slot into spaces on the cards, which add or subtract from their result in different ways. All cards with dice currently slotted contribute to your total attack number—once it's where you want it, you can launch it and destroy an enemy. It's partly a game of maths—faced with a set of numbers and modifiers, you're looking for the most direct ways to reach specific results. But it's also about resource management. With only so many dice and slots each round, the trick is using what you have as efficiently as possible. (Image cre…",

He puts it in stark terms for Hansen, \"The AI companies bought, like, 40% of the wafer production. We're not even talking finished goods, like, packages—not even chips. They're just wafers.\" And what's even wilder is that a lot of that stock may not even be in active use, instead hoarded in storage as the industry struggles to find sufficient power to fit out functional data centers.

With just 2.6% of players having earned it, it's still one of the hardest ones to get, and for a very good reason. To earn it, players must deal at least 50 damage to any enemy (arc or raider) while standing on top of a Rocketeer. (Image credit: Embark) Previously, players have used snap hooks or well-placed ledges to launch themselves through the air onto the back of a Rocketeer, tough stuff. But now player WoWAltoholic has revealed that it doesn't have to be so difficult: \"PSA: You can get the Death From Above achievement by shooting arcs from atop a dead Rocketeer part.\" Of course, it's genius. Why didn't I think of that? \"Saw this tip a few days ago and confirmed it with two other players, you can stand on a dead rockeeter part and shoot a wasp or other arc to get this achievement,\" another player adds . \"For those who have acrophobia.

When the company increased prices for laptop memory late last year , it managed not to crank up Desktop and Mainboard prices. But no longer. In an updated blog post , Framework says that memory prices from its suppliers \"continue to increase rapidly\". Apparently, 128 Gbit chips have been hit hardest by the price spikes. And it's those chips that go into 128 GB configurations. And thus it's the 128 GB option that's been hit hardest. By way of example, until these price changes, Framework was charging $799 / £799 for a 32 GB Framework Desktop Mainboard with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 chip . Now it requires $839 / £839, so not too painful a premium. Step up to the 64 GB variant with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395 and $1,299 / £1,299 has become $1,339 / £1,339. Again, that's not entirely catastrophic. So, the real pain is reserved for the 128 GB option with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395. That was $1,699 / £1,699. But it's now $2,159 / £2,159.

He decided to retire or take a break back in 2023, but has since popped up again solely to stream Arc Raiders. (Image credit: Embark Studios) The sin that Tfue committed? He was one of the many raiders who accessed the console command exploit. During a stream , Tfue's chat was pointing him towards this exploit that could remove any shadows from the map, which he then tried out in the training range and on Stella Montis. From what I've seen, that's all Tfue did—he just walked around Stella Montis, talking about how bright everything looks and then dipped.

After breaking out of Vault 31, Norm and the rest of Bud's Buds travel the Wasteland and arrive at the old Vault-Tec HQ, where Norm manages to find a working terminal and hacks in to discover what the company had planned for Vault 31, 32, and 33. (Image credit: Prime Video) It's only on screen for a second, but the following pops up: \"F.E.V. (Forced Evolutionary Virus) is the gene-altering… agent for organism supercharging. The following is a…\" Unfortunately, Norm doesn't get to see any more as he's rudely interrupted by an unsettled Ronnie McCurtry, who fries the terminal and then attacks Norm. We won't see the fruits of this virus, at least not yet, but it does play a massively important role in Fallout's story, so for those who are curious, or again, nosey, let me explain what exactly FEV is and what its purpose is in the Wasteland. FEV is an artificial virus created before the Great War by the defense contractor and research organisation West Tek, in its …",

If the last episode of Fallout Season 2 left you hoping for a knockdown, dragout fight with a deathclaw, I've got some bad news for you. After not one, not two, but three deathclaws make a dramatic entrance on the New Vegas strip, Lucy and The Ghoul make a wise but fairly unexciting decision, and one we've all made when encountering a big monster in a game: they just sprint past them and load into a new map. Despite the lack of a battle, it is nice to see typically too-cool-for-school Ghoul absolutely terrified, and we know why: he was maybe the first person to ever see a deathclaw in the wild in Alaska, and even after 200 years they still make his irradiated blood run cold. It's not a great sign for New Vegas that deathclaws have moved into the Strip, though on the other side of the fence at least Freeside is looking busier and more bustling than it ever has. Those deathclaws are now between The Ghoul and Hank MacLean, who's holed up in the secret management Vault-Tec vault The Ghoul has never managed to find—the one he believes contains his missing wife and daughter.

Here are the guidelines, straight from Bandcamp : Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted on Bandcamp. Any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles is strictly prohibited in accordance with our existing policies prohibiting impersonation and intellectual property infringement. The announcement comes after a surge in awful AI-generated music acts last year. The most infamous was probably The Velvet Sundown : at its peak the non-existent psych-rock four-piece was attracting 500,000 monthly listeners, but now generally only attracts around 160,000. Mind you, that is still a heck of a lot, especially for music so bland it sounds unmistakably like AI (though the same could have been said for Wolfmother in 2005, had generative AI existed back then).

So it's genuinely great news that Hytale, which was cancelled last summer by Riot, beat the odds and had what sounds like a massive launch today , with preorders securing enough funds to support several more years of development . No matter what, that's a remarkable achievement for a game that was all but dead and buried just a few months ago. And after spending some time today in Hytale today, I can already see the years of work that went into it. I can also see, as the devs warned us before launch, that it's got a long way to go.

I found plenty of iron deposits close to the entrance of a few deep tunnels near where I spawned in the grassy meadows. It also seems like the deeper you go into the caves, the more iron you'll find, but be prepared for tougher cave-dwelling monsters and pitch-black darkness.

At the same time Microsoft's UI designers performed an all-time beefing-it maneuver, its business geniuses rolled out a new Apple-inspired Microsoft Store and method of locking down apps that spurred Valve's Gabe Newell to declare \"Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space\" and start investing into Linux development.

Buzzing around in my giant bee-drawn wagon is pretty adorable, and many of the chores I've got do encourage me to develop a little route of regulars around the map, but the cooking minigames are really where it's at in this one. I've played more than my fair share of cozy life sims, managing everything from farms to convenience stores, but a caravan was a new one that I'd been itching to try. Cozy Caravan launched into early access on Steam last year and just rolled out its 1.0 update this month. It's not the deepest life sim by a long shot, but it's cute and approachable. The rest of my thoughts are down below, but here's a quick pros and 'less pros' chart: ✅ My favorite parts ⚠️ Take note though Adorable animations and chillstep-y tunes Recommends playing with controller Lots of little cooking minigames Stop motion animation can be disabled if it makes you sick Real time market day selling No money management Cute collectathon fetch quests NPC dialogue can be very repetitive (Image credit: 5 Lives Studio) There are four main activities that occupy my time in Cozy Caravan: driving between poi…",

After going live earlier today, Hytale is at time of writing the most watched game on Twitch by far, attracting over 420,000 viewers across thousands of streams.
