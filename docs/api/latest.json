Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Queen’s Domain now on Steam This is an experience that pays close homage to games like King's Field, an RPG series made by FromSoftware that was initially released on the PS1.

It begins with an atmospheric panning shot of a multi-level ruin, pyramidal structures looming ominously against an ocean backdrop, and darkened by moody, greenish-white cloud cover. It cuts abruptly to an animated shot of some guards camped on hard paving, banners waving gently in the dark. Queen’s Domain wants you to feel uneasy.

After a strange interstellar body appears inexplicably at the edge of the solar system, you're tasked not with trying to escape it, but to define it. Morbid curiosity insists that you, and maybe a team of trusted friends, explore its depths to uncover the endless mysteries buried beneath. …",

It's a vision of the future in which humanity has begun to colonise the solar system, but the culture has remained that of feudal Japan's. You step into the cyborg shoes of Yuzuki, the heir of a once-powerful family that was wiped out by a rival clan. She's on a quest for revenge and has undertaken secretive genetic engineering to transform herself into a samurai capable of surviving on the harsh lunar landscape. You'll slice your way through other samurai and huge robotic bosses, all set to a banging J-rock soundtrack. Music is core to SOL Shogunate, with enemy actions synced up to the tunes, but it's not a rhythm game—you're free to attack however you like.

The promise came in a filing made on December 1 (via The Game Post ), the latest step in the legal tussle between Tencent and Sony. Sony filed suit against Tencent earlier this year over Light of Motiram, a game revealed in late 2024 that looked a lot like Horizon Zero Dawn ; Sony took that characterization a step further in its lawsuit, calling Light of Motiram a \"slavish clone\" of the Horizon games. Tencent responded by purging the most egregious Horizon-like content from Light of Motiram's Steam page and bumping the release date from late 2025 to Q4 2027—a massive two-year delay, suggesting that Tencent figured it was going to get hammered if it didn't dramatically overhaul the game.

For my money: obviously the latter, but I guess we can finally put that old chestnut to bed, as is often done with chestnuts. Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser—who left the studio in 2020—has been on the interview circuit recently, promoting his new novel, and in the process of a recent chat with The Guardian , settled the debate for good: the Grand Theft Auto games are \"not as good as Dickens.\" Case closed. Wrap it up, GTAilures. Alright, yes, I am having fun with words. While Houser does think the GTA games aren't as good as ol' Dickens, he made the statement while making a broader point about how he approaches writing and designing them, which is more interesting but less funny. Recalling the time he was doing interviews to promote GTA 4's expansion packs, he remembered a French journalist telling him, \"Well, the Grand Theft Auto games are just like Dickens!\" That stuck with Houser. \"I was like, 'God bless you for saying that!'

Fallout: New Vegas had plenty of ending slides that could go in plenty of directions, but the biggest question at the end of the game was this: who won the Second Battle of Hoover Dam? Does the New California Republic bring Vegas under its control? Does Caesar's Legion turn it into a new Rome? Does Mr House outplay them both and secure his own, autocratic rule? Or (the correct answer) do the people of New Vegas shake off all these encroaching bureaucrats and tyrants in the Independent, or Yes Man, ending? We have our answer: none of the above. In an interview with IGN , Fallout season 2 executive producer Jonathan Nolan said that the show had deliberately taken \"the fog of war approach\" to picking a canon ending for the original game. He seems quite pleased with the choice, calling it \"an absolutely brilliant way to make a bit of an end run around that whole question.\" In other words, 15 years after the end of New Vegas—when Fallout's second season takes place—everyone…",

But that's all gone out the window now, because he's picked the objectively wrong Fallout faction to join. In a chat with our Elie Gould ahead of the release of Fallout season 2, the conversation alighted on the topic of what faction Howard would sign up with if he happened to wake up in the Wasteland tomorrow. His answer? The Brotherhood of Steel. \"I usually say the Brotherhood,\" Howard mused, \"because they have the best toys. I feel like I could use some power armour.\" Which, alright, fair enough. Being ensconced inside a bipedal tank probably would be quite useful in the grim, post-apocalyptic future. However, I'm afraid it's still the wrong answer.

Given the huge success the game has gone on to enjoy, ongoing support seemed inevitable. According to PC Gamer's official data partner, Newzoo , Ball X Pit has accumulated at least 744,000 players (with a majority on Xbox, where the game was available on Game Pass). But even still I'm surprised how much developer Kenny Sun has announced for 2026. Coming soon is not just one update, but three, spread out over the first half of the year. (Image credit: Kenny Sun) We'll be getting the Regal update in January, the Shadow update in April, and the Naturalist update in July—all of them free. What each one will specifically contain is still a mystery, but between them we're promised they'll add new balls, characters, buildings, evolutions, \"and more\". Will all that lure me back?

If that doesn't sound revolutionary to you, you must not understand that the true endgame of every MMO is fashion. In all seriousness, it's actually a pretty huge move. Previously, FF14's glamour system, which allows you to layer sets of appearances over your current gear, only permitted you to do so with gear that can be equipped by your current job and level. Starting with Patch 7.4, this will no longer be the case, opening up a whole new world of fashion options. This came as a surprise to players, due to the game director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P)'s past stance on the issue—even in the face of job-agnostic gear that was increasingly allowing players to throw plate armour onto their White Mages. Talking to Famitsu in an interview, Yoshi-P reveals why (note: these quotes have been machine-translated): \"I felt more strongly than anyone else that we had to cherish the Final Fantasy worldview. I felt that the way Final Fantasy ​​should be is for Dragoons to be able to equip their character in that style, and to be able to hold their spear and strik…",

So if the prices here don't match up when you read this, that's likely why. We recommend using a price checker tool, such as CamelCamelCamel, to see if you're still getting a good deal. I think I've tested every single combination of controller and NAND flash found in all of the top-end PCIe 5.0 SSDs at this point. At least all of them, trying to match or break parity with Sandisk's WD SN8100 , that is, all pinching a little bit of the drive's tech while they do it. Yet this is the first SSD I've found that kind of does manage to do that, yet in a very weird, roundabout way. This latest batch of Kingston Fury Renegade G5 drives, including this particularly boisterous 8 TB unit we have on display here, touts exactly the same NAND flash and controller combo as found in the SN8100. But, of course, all dressed up in a Kingston skirt. And I'll be frank, it works really, really well. Arguably unsurprisingly, given it's the same hardware combo that catapulted the SN8100 into our best SSD list. It's been well documented at this point …",

This time we're opting for scales rather than feathers in the My Pet Dragons mod , which does exactly what it says on the tin—adds dragons to the game. Lots of them, too. While this mod might not be as popular among players, it certainly feels just as exciting. The My Pet Dragons mod adds over 500 variations of the little critters to your game, with some spawning in specific biomes and in the Nether. You'll be able to find everything from Ice and Fire dragons to Demon and Lucky Block species (whatever that means) and tame them before embarking on some pretty intense training. After all, you don't just want a cute pet, you probably want something that can take down at least some of Minecraft's many mobs. Yes, before you ask, you can use the dragons as mounts, too. So, similarly to the owls mod, you'll be able to craft a carriage for your dragons to carry you around on, ridding the need to trek to the End and get yourself an Elytra. Plus, there is just something inherently cool about being carted around by a little dragon. It's not all abou…",

Something that's slightly interesting, or some weird quirk that the manufacturer has tweaked a certain way that's led to some curious performance metric in one manner or another.

One person who isn't quite so pessimistic, though, is the CEO of IBM, Arvind Krishna. Krishna recently spoke with Nilay Patel, EIC of The Verge, on the Decoder podcast and sounded optimistic about the future of AI—which is, to my ears at least, quite refreshing, even if I don't agree on all points. In particular, although he does explicitly say \"no\", we're not in an AI bubble, his explanation, at least on my listening, doesn't seem to completely rule out this possibility; rather, it explains how such things aren't all-or-nothing. I say this is \"refreshing\" just because of how one-dimensional a lot of AI talk can be: either 'AI sucks and the bubble's going to burst' or 'AI is an amazing innovation that will revolutionise everything.'
