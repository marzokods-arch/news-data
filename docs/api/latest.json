You'll be able to access it by clicking the flag in the top-right of the app on desktop, or heading to the bottom-right You tab and tapping the Checkpoint banner on mobile. Spotify might have kicked off the whole Wrapped thing, but plenty of others have followed suit. From Apple Music to YouTube and Amazon, there's no shortage of annual stat round-ups. It's a little worse with Discord, though, because there's already so much gamification in that app. We've already voiced concern (yeah, let's call it that) over the amount that Discord shares about our activities , and of course there's the fact that you…",

It's been one year since I first reviewed the (now Sandisk) WD Blue SN5000 , and boy oh boy, what a year it's been. That drive, at the time, didn't have a lot going for it. It was hot. It was slow. It was beaten by cheaper options, and thanks to using aging QLC NAND flash, it didn't quite deliver on the promises it made in a way that it needed to. Thankfully, the brand spanking new Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 I have here on review remedies practically every single one of my initial complaints. From a newer, refined controller to far more advanced (though still QLC) NAND flash package with higher densities and better all-around performance, it makes a damn good argument for being one of the best SSD s money can buy, at least if the price is right. So much so that it enjoys a lovely 21% increase in score over the OG SSD. Now, interestingly, Sandi…",

This can be anything from crafting materials like clay and iron, to quest items like fish, flowers, and crops. If you'd rather fulfil a request from your friend instead, it's just as easy as placing one. When you're in the Dream Teams menu, you'll see every item that each of your friends has asked for.

That level of fortune gives one plenty of opportunities to spend hours reminiscing about the past, present, and future, which is precisely what Jensen Huang and Joe Rogan recently did. Specifically, for almost two and a half hours, Huang chatted on the Joe Rogan Experience about all things AI, GPU, CUDA, consciousness, and what have you. There's an awful lot to delve into, but I was particularly drawn to the section where Rogan remarks on Nvidia's massive AI growth and capabilities: \"How funny would it be that it [AI] is birthed out of the desire for computer graphics for video games? It's kind of crazy when you think about it that way.\" This prompted Jensen to start going over Nvidia's beginning, when it was a tiny group of engineers in 1993: \"We were trying to create this new computing approach.

That's very counter-intuitive: Steam is far and away the dominant PC storefront, and conventional wisdom states that if you're not there, you're missing out on a major chunk of potential revenue. Witness, for instance, the reaction to the recent ban of Horses on Steam : Yeah, it was also dropped by the Epic Games Store and, for a day, Humble, but Steam is the one that really hurt, and developer Santa Ragione said losing it might force the studio to close. But Hypixel Studios has a very good reason for taking a pass on it: Steam user reviews. \"We want to spend our time in Early Access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing,\" Hytale executive director Patrick \"Lyall\" Derbic wrote in a new FAQ . \"Steam is a great marketing tool but one that we might never need.

Neither Eidos nor parent company Embracer Group (yes, it's an Embracer studio) have confirmed the layoffs or responded to requests for comment.

It's not exactly the same studio that produced those games, though: A couple years ago, Fullbright co-founder Steve Gaynor announced that the studio was now a solo endeavor. The company split up while working on Open Roads, and Gaynor's management was a central cause : He admitted that his strengths \"do not lie with attempting to manage a large project or direct the work of others.\" \"I hope that along with continuing the self-reflective work of the last couple years and moving forward with a sense of humility, that by taking Fullbright down this new path I'm able to make my next steps positive, productive ones,\" Gaynor wrote in 2023 when he announced that he'd started work on a new game on his own. That path first led to Toilet Spiders, a small horror game about scouring an abandoned government facility, lifting up toilet lid after toilet lid, hoping you find a key rather than a deadly spider.

Luna Abyss, which we just got a fresh glimpse of during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted, is a first-person bullet hell that looks like Doom had a run-in with Yoko Taro. Download the demo Download the Luna Abyss demo on Steam The new trailer is a tension-ratcheting mood piece that gives us a better look at the world, enemy design, gunplay, and movement. The camera pans across labyrinthine pipework and imposing gothic structures silhouetted by throbbing red neon. It's industrial, alien, and dystopian in equal measure. We get small snippets of the creatures that inhabit this world: fleshy, twisted patchworks of metal and skin that seem to leer at us like they're possessed. It's proper nightmare fuel, the kind of monsters dreamt up by Giger or Beksiński, or that nasty neighbour kid from Toy Story. Scene set, and it's onto the action. It's not long before we see why the first-person bullet hell's twist is no gimmick—facing down a hail of projectiles feels a whole lot more imposing when they're barreling directly…",
