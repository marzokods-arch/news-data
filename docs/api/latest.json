On the plus side, this is a very speedy monitor, even by OLED standards. It tops out at 480 Hz refresh, making it one of the quicker 1440p gaming OLEDs out there. It's also relatively reasonably priced for a model with 480 Hz refresh, typically coming in around $700 or £800.

But stand down, folks. Ubisoft's delayed financial report took place earlier today, and it turns out all that hullabaloo was—per company big boss Yves Guillemot—for perhaps the most boring reason imaginable: \"We appointed a new panel of auditors, that was approved at the [Annual General Meeting] last July.\" Oh. In essence, Ubi's new numbers guys decided that revenues from one of its partnerships from the fiscal year before this one needed to be recognised in a different way.

Small issues and bugs have been piling up, the Halloween event was a flop, and we've all been frustrated with the lack of an endgame. All of this stacking up before the launch of the first paid DLC, a holiday-themed pack, certainly put a damper on the celebrations. I'm glad to report that the latest Borderlands 4 weekly update has solved a number of these hot-button issues, and Gearbox has even left us a present under the tree. Let's get the biggest news out of the way first—Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is now free for all players and available right now. This holiday DLC was previously announced as a premium, paid pack, but Gearbox explains that it couldn't quite do everything it planned to before it had to release it, so it opted to make it free instead. To ensure those who own the Deluxe and above versions of the game still get the content they paid upfront for, there will be another DLC in the future, Bounty Pack 5. \"This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year.

      "body": "Microsoft has delivered some blows to Task Manager in recent times. As noted last week by PC Gamer's Andy Edser, the Windows team recently stamped out a bug that granted Task Manager immortality . The sadly now mortal Task Manager has also suffering from an indignity for months that I have only just noticed: a crappy, Windows 11-ified icon. I am generally ambivalent about Windows 11's aesthetic. The icons and menus are mostly uninspired but serviceable, blending in with 2020s corporate visual design in a manner befitting an operating system that's iterated itself into a state of near non-identity ( AI will solve that problem, of course !). The desire for, I guess, cohesive branding has hit some Windows icons harder than others. Every Microsoft Office application is now represented by an amorphous blob of color that suggests the vague idea of a thing. It's funny that a decade or so ago we were remarking upon the fact that the go-to save icon, a floppy disk, is a meaningless reference for young people. Now Microsoft has deliberately chosen to turn Outlook's icon into MC Escher's interpretation of an envelope. Take that art history elective if you want to use Office, I guess! (Image …",

But where the previous Spider-Man crossover set was content to wrap deep cuts from the Spider-Verse in existing mechanics, Avatar is more systemically ambitious, giving each flavor of elemental bending its own mechanic. Which is an interesting choice for a set you would expect to be aimed at younger players, but I guess they figured if a 12-year-old can play Magic and make it through the filler episodes where Aang and the gang trudge through a swamp or a town where things are a bit weird then they can sure as hell learn some new rules.

And developer Chief Rebel has the numbers to show it. In a new developer update video , community director Hamish Bode laid out some fun numbers from the game's first month in early access. Even though Fellowship has a long road ahead of it, players have already sunk in a combined 7.2 million hours played. In that time, over 9 million dungeons have been cleared. Bode didn't share the number of dungeons players failed to clear, but he did say that they've died over 49 million times. Ouch. All of that is really just proof that a game where you can run MMO-style dungeons over and over is exactly the kind of thing people have been hoping someone would make.

Path of Exile 2's The Last of the Druids update is coming on December 12. Druids will join the other seven classes and, because this is PoE, will come with a bunch of new skills that anyone can use. However, only the druids will be able to shapeshift into a bear and other animals on the fly. Developer Grinding Gear Games previewed the druid two years ago , and that was the last time we saw them.

Rumors about a possible Sims 4 remaster came to a boil earlier this week thanks to a post by The Sims Community collecting a small handful of vague \"I know something you don't\" style posts on X by those claiming to have some inside info. It's either a \"rewrite\" of The Sims 4 or a \"remaster\" or \"Sims 4 HD,\" according to a variety of unconfirmed sources. There were also images leaked from a playtest—of what appears to be the same mobile Sims game playtests that have been leaking on the regular for around a year—along with mention of a \"platform for the future\" likely referring to the same The Sims Hub that EA vaguely announced last year and has yet to officially mention again.

But it's still making corrections before that, too, and interested run-and-gunners will have a chance to check out the latest updates in another round of playtesting set for December. Unlike the recently concluded October playtest, which was open to players in North America and Europe, this one in December will be accessible only to those in North America.

To serve as the battleground for this existential conflict, the Hokkaido map has been remixed into Popsomp Hills Asylum, an \"environment where doctors, patients, and performers blur into one,\" where Slim Shady \"delivers erratic live performances to a captive audience of staff and inmates.\" Presumably, Agent 47 thinks this is cool and fine. I don't know what force or magic has hewn Eminem into a bifurcated being at war with himself. I only know that, as of today, it is my duty, obligation, and sacred calling to kill Slim Shady with mom's spaghetti. The \"surreal new mission,\" IO Interactive sa…",

Shortly after the success of Vampire Survivors, Luca \"was already thinking of getting in touch with other indie studios to start working on spin-offs,\" so the idea behind Vampire Crawlers has been gestating for about four years.

It was announced by no less than director Quentin Tarantino and star Uma Thurman at a Fortnite event hosted at the Vista Theater in Hollywood, California (owned by one, erm, Q. Tarantino).

Spending all your time, energy, and resources on killing a gaggle of tanks with a whole squad of Engineers behind them can, at times, feel like a worse fate than Sisyphus rolling his boulder up a hill; at least he doesn't get headshot by a sniper from halfway across the map when he's at the top of the mountain. But life goes on, and you have to make do with what you have, and every so often, it does get better. I had one of these moments recently when I hopped into a Rush match and found that my Anti-Armour field spec perk now spawned me in with five RPG rockets straight away; yes, you heard me, FIVE. (Image credit: EA) We were on defence at Liberation Peak, and thanks to the extra rockets, I was able to tear apart the attacking enemy tanks, firing off MBT-LAW missiles one after the other until they were nothing but scrap. It was glorious. I was wondering where the update had come from when I stumbled across this post from DBONKA , explaining how this field spec had been slightly tweaked: \"Previously, this perk provided +2 max rockets, but it was balanced by the fact that you had to seek out …",

Valve's cute little cube will run SteamOS and use Proton—a compatibility layer to make Windows games play nice with Linux—but you can't play official Rust using it. The latest plea for official Proton support started on Reddit , where Scout339v2 shared their screenshot of Rust running \"on a server with EAC disabled to show that the game already works perfectly on Linux.\" Disabling Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) is the key factor here, and part of a broader conversation where Facepunch and its Linux/Proton userbase don't see eye-to-eye. While it's true Rust runs on Proton, you can't join official servers, and most unofficial servers, with EAC disabled. Facepunch considered changing its stance in 2022 when the Steam Deck launched, but didn't end up introducing official Proton support. COO Alistair McFarlane said at the time that Linux is \"safer for cheat developers,\" and that trying to support EAC on another platform could reduce the team's ability to support Windows.

The problem being, these combat mods are often used for things other than raw, sweaty, glorious DPS and efficiency. For example, cleaning up visual noise and making the game more accessible. Or, in some cases, just customising superficial elements of the UI to your liking—whether to combat colour blindness or for the aesthetic. And given how public Blizzard tends to be with WoW's betas, there's been a lot of hand-wringing. See, Blizzard's taken a sort of 'wipe the slate clean, then pare it back' approach. It's easier for UI designers to come down hard, then slowly make exceptions based on feedback. But given the enormity of this change, some players are getting a touch skittish.

Welcome tweaks, of course, but no real swings at specific weapons and items. And that's not completely unwarranted, as I'd say most guns are pretty well-balanced right now. But while everyone's been singing the praises of the Anvil as a weapon that shoots far above its weight, the Venator has been the sleeper pick all along for PvP. Firing two shots at once, this rare pistol was capable of dropping other players blazingly fast. It was only a matter of time until the reaper came knocking, and that day is today with the 1.3.0 patch notes . In short, the Venator has had its incrementally upgraded fire rate reduced from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%, and its weight from 2kg to 5kg. Embark explains in the patch notes that it's \"re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact.\" \"This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter.

She asks you to head to Dam Battlegrounds and track down two of her old diaries from the original Arc War days that she lost at various Raider outposts. The first one is easy enough, but the second only gives you a description to go on, so it's a bit trickier. Since you have to extract both of Celeste's Journal items in one round, you may as well bring a free loadout , since a safe pocket isn't going to do you much good when you can only extract one of them anyway (unless you want to risk an augment with multiple safe pockets, I suppose). Whatever strategy you go for, here's how to complete Celeste's Journals in Arc Raiders. Retrieve Celeste's Journals from the South Swamp Outpost Celeste's first journal is located in the entrance room to the South Swamp Outpost on Dam Battlegrounds (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first journal is easy enough to track down.

Overall, Nvidia raked in $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025 . That's 62% up on the same quarter in 2024 and 22% up on Q2 2025. It was enough to have CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang comment, \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.\" Reflecting the importance of Nvidia not just to the ongoing AI boom but the entire global economy, markets across the world rallied in response to Nvidia's record earnings. Nvidia's own share price went up, too, inevitably. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia's current share price of around $196 in after hours trading is still well down on its October peak of $212, perhaps reflecting that even these new and impressive results aren't enough to entirely erase concerns over a mooted AI bubble and what might happen if it bursts. As for the future, Nvidia is predicting even higher revenues. It has next quarter pencilled in at $65 billion and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress predicted another $350 billion in AI GPU sales between now and the end of 2026.…",
