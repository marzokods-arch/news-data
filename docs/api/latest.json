      "body": "For the brave among us who are diving into Silksong without having played Hollow Knight, some of the game's quirks will seem a bit opaque. One of these quirks is the map system, or rather, the seeming lack of it. It's definitely not uncommon for exploration-focused platformers to have obscure or downright useless maps, but for a while Silksong seems like it might not even have one at all. Don't worry though: not only does Silksong have a map, but it can be very useful so long as you cough up some rosaries ASAP. After about an hour in Silksong you'll encounter the NPC Shakra in The Marrow—listen out for the lovely yodelling. After some dialogue they'll offer to sell you a bunch of map-centric stuff, and your first instinct might be to ignore it. Of course this metroidvania will just plot out my map as I explore it, right? Nope: not only do you have to buy maps, but you have to buy map markers and other useful icons, such as those demarking resting places. Oh, and you also have to buy the ability to see yourself on the map. Even though Shakra's gear might seem expensive in total, you should 100% buy it all up as soon as you meet them. It's going to make early exploration a lot more …",

Considering he's recently announced that Stardew Valley will be getting a 1.7 update and apparently done a little moonlighting as a bug, I think he might've been onto something. I checked Silksong's credits today to see how many folks contributed to the long-awaited metroidvania outside Team Cherry's core trio, and there's Barone, right alongside several members of designer William Pellen's family. Considering Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight released within a year of each other and both went on to become some of the most successful indie games of all time, I'm not too surprised to see they travel in the same circles. Or at least they're friendly enough that when Team Cherry was in need of \"additional character voices\" for Silksong's new cast of characters, Barone got the call. Or perhaps Barone is such a massive Hollow Knight fan that he begged to go bug mode for the sequel? (Image credit: Team Cherry) If you harbor any doubt that it's the Barone, The…",

The fourth one, I think, or maybe it's the fifth? I still haven't completed a full playthrough of Baldur's Gate, but I sure do have Act 1 down.

The Apple dance, as it became known, was a huge TikTok trend in summer 2024 and has been adopted by Charli XCX herself: Heyer even performed the dance live at one of the star's concerts. It was impossible to avoid at the time, and was subsequently incorporated into a Charli XCX-themed \"Brat\" update for the Roblox game Dress to Impress. The legalities all get a little murky here. Heyer and Roblox were apparently in talks to license the dance in early August last year, but then the update containing the emote was released before any \"signed agreement\", and Heyer subsequently copyrighted the dance. Her lawsuit claimed that Roblox had made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November 2024, and said Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" Well, now she has been, although there's no disclosure of the su…",

At time of writing, more than 500,000 people are playing Silksong on Steam, and the number's increasing every time I refresh the SteamDB chart . In its first 24 hours, Silksong's all-time peak player count is already the 18th highest in Steam history . And it'll likely rank higher before the day's out. As a point of comparison, the original Hollow Knight's Day 1 concurrent player count on Steam peaked at 812 players. In other words, there are roughly 615 times as many people playing Silksong in its first hours than there were playing Hollow Knight at launch. Call me crazy, but I think this one might be a big deal.

Instead, there are a few ways to get Rosaries, which you'll use to purchase items from merchants like Pebb in Bone Bottom or maps from Shakra once you encounter her.

Now an upcoming PowerToys utility means I won't be jumpscared with a bright white blast to my eyeballs right before bed time. For those unfamiliar, PowerToys is a Windows utility for those never content with a system default. Tucked away into the accompanying blog post for the PowerToys 0.94 update (via Windows Latest ) is news of a feature in the works that will \"automatically switch between light and dark mode based on your schedule.\" At present in Windows 11 , you can select dark mode by ducking into settings, then looking under personalisation, and then colours. You can also pick a muted 'accent' colour to highlight certain features of the Windows UI—such as sliders and hyperlink text—without harshing the more sedate vibes of dark mode. The rest of the recent 0.94 update focuses on quality of life updates, such as adding a search box into the PowerToys settings menu, plus a new gliding cursor mode that offers a little extra support for …",

With 36,000,000 users online, Steamstat.us currently lists the Steam store as operating at a \"Very slow\" capacity, occasionally ticking over to a concerned, yellow \"Bad gateway\" message. It is worth mentioning, of course, that Hollow Knight: Silksong was never up for pre-order. Anyone who wanted day-one access to the game had to turn up at 15:00 GMT on the dot and buy the dang thing. Would allowing pre-orders, rather than forcing the game's incredibly thirsty fans and legions of curious onlookers to all show up at once, have ameliorated this situation? Probably a bit. But it would have been much less funny. Social media is awash with Steam users rather shocked and/or miffed by the whole thing. \"Skong crashed steam😔,\" writes one . \"STEAM FIX YOURSELF PLEASE IM T…",

The handheld is demo-ed in a recent video (via NITTRX ), with the creator commenting that playing racing games is \"very exciting.\" And while we're on the subject of peering over from the backseat, the creator has also shared pictures that demonstrate how the handheld is both longer than their rearview mirror and their forearm . This same creator has made a number of charming 'WinMini' handhelds in the past, so it's no surprise that this latest ultrawide effort is similarly Windows-based. The project is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU , the same chip in the MSI Claw A8 and the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds.

Bloodscent gives you a literal blood trail and heartbeat sound effect while you're near isolated enemies and, more importantly, a permanent stacking weapon damage buff whenever you kill (or assist in a kill) an enemy hero. In other words, if you've got terrible map sense and are blindly farming the jungle while the Drifter's about, he's going to get a bazillion Bloodscent stacks and run you over. Victor's a little more complicated. His Aura of Suffering builds up damage to enemies and himself, his Jumpstart trades HP for regeneration and movement speed, and his Pain Battery lashes out whenever he takes damage.

The shizzle here involves a couple of new trade mark applications by Valve centred on the term \"Steam Frame\", as spotted on Reddit yesterday . The more interesting and specific of the two says, \"STEAM FRAME™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of computer game consoles for recreational game playing; video game consoles; video game accessories, namely, controllers for video games.\" That's about as unambiguous as it gets. Of course, applying for a trade mark doesn't guarantee that trade mark gets used. It could even be an intentional distraction designed to draw attention away from some other naming scheme or project.

Most Borderlands fans would say that the game only really gets going once you've finished the campaign and reached the endgame, and I'd agree; that's when you officially start grinding post-campaign activities and gearing up your Vault Hunter. That's not changed in Borderlands 4 . In fact, it's getting a handful of really great changes that'll make it hard to go back to previous games. I'm glad that we're finally able to skip the campaign and jump straight to level 30 on alternate characters, making playing all four characters a much more enjoyable experience. Likewise, I love that gear score doesn't increase with each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode tier, so you don't need to re-farm gear each time you climb up the ranks anymore.

I'm thankful for my plush neck pillow and face mask to keep my senses dulled to what's around me when I fly, though nothing has made as great a difference as my noise cancelling headphones. The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal are my blocker of choice, as they're the most effective at reducing outside noise and jet turbine rumble to the bare minimum. So, you might be surprised to hear my rally against noise cancelling headphones for gaming, but let me explain. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is when the headset uses microphones and onboard processing to counteract outside interference. It's quite literally cancelling the noise out with an equal and opposite soundwave. There are multiple types of ANC: feed-forward, which uses a microphone outside the device to pickup external noise; and feed-back, which listens closely to what's happening closer to the listener's ear canal to more accurately counteract what's actually seeping in. The best systems often use a combination of both and adapt how they use each technology for better results. That's what the Beoplay Portal offers, so it's a great example of wha…",

Below, I'll go over all you need to know about Marvel Rivals Season 4 right now, including the release date and the latest news on new heroes and other content arriving in the next major update. Marvel Rivals Season 4 release date and time Marvel Rivals Season 4 launches on Friday, September 12, 2025 , after server downtime at 1 am PDT / 4 am EST / 9 am GMT, which coincides with the end of Season 3 (though the battle pass will stick around). The mid-season update, Season 4.5, should launch on or around Friday, October 10, 2025, just one month after the first half of the update. Honestly, I'm still not used to this faster pace, with full seasons lasting just two months.

We do have a release window, and we know who we can expect to meet during our time in the new realm, but there are still a lot of holes in our knowledge that could do with patching up.

Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: Made yet another Baldur's Gate 3 character despite not having finished the game with any of the six characters he's already made. Once inside, Bond strolls around talking to himself and triggering little in-engine cutscenes, and you get the impression that there's only one way the mission can really go. When the video segues to a car chase, it makes this explicit with the text \"Inevitably…\" on the screen.

There's a cozy game, a couple puzzlers, and one with lots of combat, if that's what you're looking for. And if September doesn't have enough for you, I've tacked on a few more promising city builders planned for late 2025 and 2026. Since these city builders sprawl across multiple genres, I've got a code I'll use below to identify what categories each these builders fit into: Sim ⚙️, Strategy ♟️, Survival 🍖, Puzzle 🧩, Cozy 🧸, Old Timey 👑, and Futuristic 🚀. If there's a demo available, I've also added a 📀.

I'm willing to endure the most prickly parts of PoE 2 because the campaign is excellent—and it just got better. The latest update adds a new act that has me fully on board with Grinding Gear Games' vision for an action RPG campaign that might be as ambitious as the version of Diablo 2 that exists in people's memories. I'm too young to have had my mind blown by Blizzard 25 years ago, but right now, in 2025, I'm not sure anyone is doing it like GGG. I'm so impressed by the new act that I'll forgive the pacing issues in the rest of the campaign. After all, that's what releasing your game in early access is for, right? Part of me sympathizes with PoE 1 players who hate spending 30 hours getting torn apart by regular old skeletons when all they want to do is charge straight to the endgame. The endless mazes in act 3 test my patience every time I replay it, but now that I've seen what lies beyond that, I trust GGG to find a good balance of soulslike pacing and action RPG …",

Abyssus is a lithe shooter: you've got a dash and a double-jump right from the start, and enemies like divebombing exploding sharks encourage constant dancing around its battle arenas.
