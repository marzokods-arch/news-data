The GPU was saved by wiring in the VRMs of an AMD Radeon RX 580 donor card, creating a monstrous hybrid GPU that looked ridiculous, but appeared to work surprisingly well. Well, far from resting on their laurels, the team has since taken their efforts one step further (via Videocardz ). Thanks to the addition of an Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti PCB as its base and some clever power tweaking, the GPU-with-a-hole has managed to set a world record: the top spot in Unigine Superposition's online rankings for an RTX 5070 Ti, running the 8K optimized preset. Over the course of a seven-hour+ live stream , the team fought against a litany of issues to convince the Frank-o-card to perform properly, including an early problem with low-resolution-only output and voltage drops under load. A rat's nest of wires, the judicious use of yellow tape, and the odd cutting tool were used to reduce conductor resistance and voltage loss between the two cards—although it still seems to have the odd quirk worth looking into.

We have a lot of demand this year.\" One of the attendees was TSMC CEO C.C. Wei, who did not answer questions from reporters. While the AI boom continues to run its course, TSMC's position as the key manufacturer at the base of the chip production chain has led to some reports that the limits of its current packaging capacity may be a bottleneck , as demand for AI hardware continues to be strong.

Catacomb 3-D was part of a deal id had with its founders' former employer, Softdisk. Some of id's first games⁠—made in blisteringly fast two-month development cycles until Wolfenstein 3-D ⁠—were distributed in Gamer's Edge, a monthly, subscription-based demo disk of games put out by the software company.

When Markiplier spotted that certain charts weren't displaying the movie's box office gross, Szymanski quote-reposted a thread discussing the observation with a Starship Troopers meme reading, \"It's afraid.\" When it first landed, it raked in a combined $12.5 million from Thursday previews and the Friday box office—that's over four times its estimated budget, which, as Forbes points out , is estimated to be just under $3 million.

It's not an easy game. But, the question always goes, how can I make this harder on myself? An update arrived Jan. 28 with the answer: Melandru's Accord. \"Inspired by the community-driven Ironman challenge,\" the new game mode will require that players earn all their skills and items without the relief of player trading or mercenaries (special NPC helpers that copy character builds and gear). The full list of restrictions can be perused in the patch notes, but suffice it to say it's similar to the self-found modes you can try in World of Warcraft: Classic Hardcore and Old School RuneScape.

If you're not sure which to buy and would rather start with just one, here's the main series rundown. The original two Fallout games are top-down, turn-based masterworks that, while pretty old, are landmark CRPGs and furnished the series with its iconic juxtaposition of atomic age aesthetics, grisly hyperviolence, and sardonic humor. The first Fallout game is my personal favorite, and don't let its vintage fool you—as 90s RPGs go, it's approachable. Fallout 3 and the Obsidian-developed New Vegas come after the series was bought from the original publisher, Interplay, by Bethesda. These 3D open-world RPGs are both widely celebrated…",

It's almost hypnotic in a way. Hell, maybe it was, because not once did I think to myself \"Hmm, isn't it weird that a game set in 1912 is using a song that didn't release until over 50 years later?\" I definitely should have thought that, because the way BioShock Infinite toys with real-world music is one of its coolest narrative devices.

I've always deeply admired cosplayers.

Unfortunately I suck at arts and crafts, don't have a lot of money to get someone else to do it, and I'm just… well, a bit shy.

Among those space sims jostling for supremacy was Star Quest 1 in the 27 th Century . Developed by Virtual Adventures Inc and released in November 1995, its defining feature was how it allowed seamless transition between open space and planetary atmospheres, which technically put it decades ahead of games like No Man's Sky. Sadly, this wasn't enough to make Star Quest a big success, and the game's been largely forgotten in the interceding years. Until now, that is. Three decades since Star Quest first appeared, its designer Paul Lauzon has updated the space combat sim so that it works on modern machines, and re-released it over on itch. Best of all, you can download it for completely free. Lauzon announced the game's rerelease over on Reddit . \"I’m the original developer of Star Quest 1 in the 27th Century, first released in 1995,\" he wrote in the post. \"I spent the last few w…",

Given the whole process is necessarily artificial, it never struck me how bizarre it looks in the instant before the fade—when the NPC about to vanish lights up like they've just been plugged into the mains. As well as all shadows on them disappearing their hair looks super weird, vanishing from their eyebrows, sideburns, and the nape of the neck as the transparencies suddenly fail. Watching the video by modder wSkeever really makes it impossible to ignore.

The new 5v5 mode was implemented just four days after release on Jan. 30, which is a pretty impressive turnaround time for something added in response to community sentiment.

The patch notes, which you can find on Deadlock’s feedback forum , call this a hero banning system, but there are a few reasons for both why this is different and why it might be necessary for a game in pre-alpha. Most ranked modes in MOBAs have a draft phase—a pre-game lobby where both teams take turns selecting heroes for their team and banning them so that no one can play them in that match.

The powerful women of the Mediterranean and Islam typically don't, except as footnotes or asides. So her leadership, piracy and plundering for her people never quite made the major texts. But the \"pirate queen\" of Morocco is finally receiving her due, at least in videogame form, as one of the playable heroes in Civilization 7 's recent Tides of Power Collection DLC—thanks in part to the digging of one University of Kansas professor. \"[Al-Hurra] is fascinating,\" says Finn Taylor, senior narrative designer at Firaxis Games for the 4X strategy title. \"She was highly educated, greatly respected by both friends and foes, and accomplished remarkable feats during a challenging time in Moroccan history.\" Her last name is actually an honorific title, meaning \"free,\" and is given to those who lead—similar to a regional mayor. When Amal El Haimeur, an assistant professor at the University of Kansas, ran across her name as an aside in a book, she was immediately curious. Sayyida was one of two women in El Haimeur's memory to hold the title, and the only one in Morocco. \"It became a research question for m…",

Tainted Grail kept players well fed over 2025 with a constant stream of patches, and Questline looks set to carry that momentum forward into 2026. With the release of Tainted Grail's latest patch , the developers revealed that a bigger update is coming in February, while a free DLC will be released to all players in March. Questline doesn't delve too deeply into the details for either set of plans, though it is slightly more forthcoming about the February update.

Now though, players can get their grubby mitts on it thanks to a glitch discovered by a YouTuber. Said YouTuber is JustGarrison, who, in a zingy twist of irony, stumbled upon the glitch during a pacifist run of Bully.

It's here where JustGarrison inadvertently unlocked the weapon—a sledgehammer that was previously only usable during the boss fight. During the boss fight, Norton tries to bash Jimmy's head in with the sledgehammer. But once Norton is defeated, Jimmy can equip the sledgehammer and use it to retrieve some key quest items through the medium of smashing. That's all he can do with it, however.

No, I'm not a hero, I'd just rather stare at a screen than do any real work. Iron Lung , if you haven't played it yourself, is a first-person horror sim where you're sealed inside a tiny submarine and submerged in an ocean of blood on an alien planet. Using minimalist controls, you steer your windowless sub around taking pictures of whatever is lurking in the bloody depths while getting progressively more scared and paranoid. It's a great game. It's also a short game, perfect for a single sitting: Markiplier's YouTube playthrough is only about 45 minutes long, though the…",

Team Fortress 2 Classified (formerly called TF2 Classic ) has relaunched as an official Steam mod with its own store page and everything. The revamped TF2 Classified, now running on the official TF2 SDK that Valve released last year, is both throwback (hence its old \"Classic\" moniker) and additive: paring down the 19-year-old shooter to its pre-hats era while adding a select few new weapons, modes, and a whole new class. Here's the elevator pitch, as pulled from the TF2 Classified Steam page: Meet the Civilian, a brand-new special class based on the legacy Team Fortress character, and deliver him mostly-unharmed to the objective in VIP mode. Use TF2 pre-release inspired weapons like the Nail Gun, the Dynamite Pack, and the Tranquilizer Gun, all redesigned from the ground up to feel right at home with what's already there. Go on a rampage in Multi-Team maps, where GRN and YLW bring their unique (yet strangely identical) brand of violence to Arena, King of the Hill, and more.

The moment arrived during a press conference featuring Tottenham Hotspur manager Thomas Frank, a Danish coach whose witty asides are not quite papering over the fact that the club is having a terrible season. Frank took over in June last year from Ange Postecoglou, a garrulously amusing Australian who committed the cardinal sin of winning something with Spurs and was promptly sacked. Nevertheless the North London club remain one of the biggest around, and one of the players it's been heavily linked to over this transfer window was Antoine Semenyo.

Also unsurprisingly, given his competing store and past criticism of Steam, Sweeney approves of the action, and based on his related legal tussles with Apple and Google, thinks there's something to it. The lawsuit, filed in 2024, very broadly alleges that Valve unfairly prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms and requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices for UK consumers. Valve had argued that the suit should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—but a Competition Appeal Tribunal disagreed, ruling earlier this week that the suit can proceed. Sweeney has homed in on the DLC issue specifically.

      "body": "Code Vein 2 can feel like a cakewalk for the first hour or so, but you'll quickly hit a wall in the form of Franz the Dejected Assailant . Defeating Franz will change the past and unlock Noah as a companion in the present, so there's a lot on the line here. If you're struggling with the Dejected Assailant like I was, these tips will help you take Franz down so you can continue the main story. Franz the Dejected Assailant phase one I'm just going to level with you here. Parrying makes this boss so much easier. I know parrying sounds scary when the game showers you in shields and other defensive tools, but equipping a Forma that lets you parry attacks is basically a must against the Dejected Assailant. You can get one by talking to one of Jadwiga's Minions in MagMell next to the sparring arena. (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Other than that, make sure Noah is out on the field with you. If you try to duel the Dejected Assailant one-on-one, you'll have a hard time finding safe openings to deal damage, but Noah can help draw aggro away from you. Parry his dash attack: The Dejected Assailant is incredibly aggressive and will close the gap with a lightning-fast dash if you get too far. It'…",

And now, it's even going as far as to characterise itself as helping build a \"rebel alliance\" against Big Tech. The company has released an animation- and graphic-heavy roadmap and report , which in many ways reads like a very dramatic vision statement about how it can challenge the way that AI is developing at the hands of Big Tech. It's kind of bonkers, but in a way that I can't help but get on board with. \"What if a rebel alliance of sorts—developers, activists, researchers, founders, investors—joined forces to build something different?\" It envisions that this alliance will \"push AI in a direction that is trustworthy, human-centered and shaped by all of us.\" Which I suppose explains the focus on turning Firefox into an \"AI browser.\" Regarding this, Mozilla does clarify that its vision for Firefox is one of …",

Still, it's got a fantastic collection of relics from a computer age gone by that you can now view online, including this wonderfully uncomfortable-looking mouse: (Image credit: Computer History Museum) This little beauty was designed by Silicon Graphics Computer Systems and manufactured by Mouse Systems Corp. (remember when hardware company names made sense?) and features three whole buttons. Three! I doubt it has a specs sheet to make any of the offerings in our best gaming mouse guide tremble, but I'd still love to give it a home regardless.

In the case of Anthropic, it's turned to the military as the pot of bountiful cash, but according to one report, it's now discovering that all that glitters isn't gold. The agreement between Anthropic and the then-named Department of Defense to \"prototype frontier AI capabilities that advance U.S. national security\" was announced last July, and while it was only given a capped $200 million budget—a fraction of the money it's received from Microsoft and Nvidia —the makers of Claude were looking \"look forward to deepening our collaboration across the Department to solve critical mission challenges\". However, Reuters claims that six months on, the relationship between the now Department of War and Anthropic has taken a bit of a turn , and it's apparently all down to the safeguards that are built into the LLM models.
