So it's good news for a bunch of handheld gamers that Asus has just released a big batch update for the three handhelds, plus the oft-forgotten ROG Xbox Ally (non-X). And when I say a 'big' batch update, I mean a BIG one, at least if Asus' announcement post on X is anything to go by: \"Everyone! This is a BIG week for updates on the ROG Ally, ROG Ally X, ROG Xbox Ally, and ROG Xbox Ally X! A new Armoury Crate SE update is on the way, bringing expanded CPU and power controls, stability upgrades, and a series of fixes and improvements across both devices.\" I'm not sure what \"both\" refers to, given the company lists four devices, not two, but what I can say is the most exciting updates are for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. The latter gets 'P-core' and 'E-core' options in the Armoury Crate SE software. Note that 'core' is all lowercase there, because 'P-Cores' and 'E-Cores' refer to Intel cores. AMD has its own v…",

However, the days of this vastly preferable third option may be numbered.

Online privacy nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation recently criticised this strategy, taking aim at Wisconsin's bill in particular, saying that blocking the use of VPNs is \"going to be a disaster for everyone.\" The foundation argues that due to lawmakers misunderstanding how the location-masking technology works, \"Websites subject to this proposed law are left with this choice: either cease operation in Wisconsin, or block all VPN users, everywhere, just to avoid legal liability in the state.

      "body": "OLED PC monitor sales are on the up, according to data outfit Trendforce . Compared to last year, sales are up by fully 65%. That's comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the same period in 2024. If you instead put this quarter up against the previous quarter in 2025, sales of OLED monitors are up 12%, with a grand total of 644,000 units. Trendforce is predicting 2.62 million units, total, for 2025 and over 80% growth versus 2024. For context, another analyst firm, IDC, is forecasting over 130 million overall PC monitor sales of all types for 2025 and around 25 million specifically gaming monitor sales this year. That latter figure is probably the most relevant. Currently, the vast majority of OLED monitors are aimed at gaming, with just a handful of models either engineered for content creation and other professional use or the premium consumer segment. That means OLED is predicted to have roughly 10% of the PC gaming monitor market in 2025. Incidentally, if you're wondering who the big noises in OLED monitors are, according to Trendforce, Asus has taken over the top spot from Samsung, with 21.9% market share in its latest figures. OLED TVs still make monitors seem pricey. (Ima…",

I'd prefer just to use one mouse for everything, but I've yet to find one that suits all my needs and preferences, all of the time. Most of that comes down to feel and fit. The Viper is great for gaming, but I often prefer to have something more substantial in hand for work, which is where the Pro Click comes in. There isn't a mouse around that's capable of being both whenever I want it to, but the Orbital Pathfinder is certainly on the path to being that mouse, thanks to its wealth of customization options. Which is why we've just added such a category to our best gaming mouse guide , and until something better comes along, the Pathfinder is our top recommendation for the best customizable gaming mouse.

To be fair, he's got receipts. Navok summons the recent examples of Arc Raiders and the Roblox game Steal a Brainrot to back up his points. Arc Raiders, of course, makes prominent use of AI voices, which did little to stop it peaking at 480,000 concurrent players last weekend. Steal a Brainrot, meanwhile, \"had 30m concurrents or approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents,\" says Navok, \"and is named after/based on AI slop characters.

Nevertheless, it's here in the control room in the east of Power Generation Complex that I made a miraculous discovery: the locked door I've walked past so many times doesn't require a unique keycard like every other door does. It turns out you need to slot a Power Rod into the door to crack it open. Yes, the Power Rod isn't just a crafting material; it's technically a key, too.

The post also says that \"recipients can use their Epic Rewards balance to redeem gifts\"—an odd phrasing that makes it sound like you'll need to use Reward points to redeem a gift you've been given. However, in the longer Gift FAQ, Epic clarifies that \"you can use your Epic Rewards balance toward a gift purchase\" which makes a lot more sense. As for what you can gift friends on Epic, the answer is most items on the store, but not everything. The exceptions are free games (for obvious reasons) pre-purchase offers, subscriptions, and in-game currency or other consumable items. Anyone who receives a gift on Epic has 14 days to claim it, somewhat shorter than the 30 days allowed by Steam.

As discovered on the game's subreddit by user zero-sumgames (who collated the info, alongside u/serversamwinchester and u/bog_waif ), whether or not Invisigal stays a hero or becomes a villain is dependent on a modifier in the game's code called the \"RobertMentorCounter\" system, or RMC. Essentially, this hidden value will have Invisigal become a hero and take a bullet for Robert if it's high, or have her become a villain and kill Shroud if it's low: \"Your RMC is affected through story decisions, succeeding in story-related hacking events, and the barfight QTE's. All of which are detailed here. However, your RMC is also affected by Dispatching.\" That is to say, while your choices as R…",

Heineman was 62, and the GoFundMe will remain live to help her family make final arrangements. Born in 1963, Heineman initially made a mark on the industry by winning a national Space Invaders tournament in 1980 in New York, becoming the first formally recognized US champion of any videogame. She went on to have a far-reaching career, being credited on 67 games according to MobyGames . Heineman co-founded Interplay in 1983 alongside Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell. The developer and publisher was the source of many foundational PC games, including Wasteland, Fallout, and Baldur's Gate. Heineman designed and programmed a number of games at Interplay, with her most prominent design credit being The Bard's Tale 3: Thief of Fate.

And yet, here we all are again, charging down the field with renewed gusto following Valve's big hardware announcements . Given how many times we've ended up flat on our backs behind an unkicked football, I cringe to say this, but it's not unreasonable to believe that a new Half-Life game will be announced within the next year or so. The recent excitement on the Half-Life subreddit is partially due to misunderstandings (reporter Jason Schreier does not in fact have insider information about an imminent announcement), but is at least somewhat justified by the facts: The idea that Valve might release a new Half-Life game is no longer in the realm of pure imagination, as it put out the VR-only Half-Life: Alyx in 2020 The Half-Life: Alyx ending (spoilers) very much leaves the door open for future Half-Life games Five years is enough time to have made a new Half-Life game (although barely,…",

Some crash and burn on day one while others are kept alive by players, modders, and community creators long after they might have otherwise slipped away. A few games, however, have lived on for decades, kept alive not just by passionate fans but by developers who have never thrown in the towel or dusted off their hands and said \"done.\" These games have, against all odds, managed to withstand the test of time. They're still being worked on after 20, 30, even 40(!) years. When we first wrote a version of this list in 2018, all of the games we included had been updated that year. Amazingly, seven years later they're all still alive, even if updates are a bit fewer and farther between. But almost every entry on this updated list has either been updated in 2025, or in the last couple years, with its development history making us pretty sure they'll still see another patch in the second half of this decade.

I love it so much. Demon King producer Andy Han got me in touch with Daifuku so I could find out how you make a game that sounds like literal hell. The answer, it seems, is some incredibly creative (and occasionally painful) sample work. \"Making the sounds was basically just layering, spectrally morphing and manipulating samples until I found something I thought sounded cool,\" Daifuku said. \"Most of the sounds I made were simply happy accidents, such as the Nure-onna gasping before she feeds, which was me accidentally eating very stale banana chips.\" Unfortunately, the exact scene Daifuku is referencing is not on YouTube, but I'm pretty sure you can hear the gasp in question (followed by some stomach-churning slurping) at the 57-second mark of this trailer for Labyrinth of the Demon King. \"I thought…",

The filing claims Kim went so far as to consult with AI to figure a way out of paying, but even ChatGPT told him he was probably stuck. The legal dispute between Krafton and Subnautica designer and director Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire has been dragging on since July, when all three very suddenly left their positions . While the departures were initially presented as amicable, it quickly became clear that it was anything but. Legal action was filed by both sides and it's gotten very messy: Krafton initially said the three were fired because of the state of Subnautica 2 and their insistence on releasing it before it was ready, but in September it seemed to drop that claim in favor of focusing on allegations the founders had \"deceived\" Krafton , including that they'd downloaded confidential informatio…",

Notorious for showing up right after a controversial balance patch last year , the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur has been released from its cage and it might be the reason WoW Tokens are currently sold out in the UK. The mount was extraordinarily popular last time. Players were crowding the streets with it, which led some other players to despair as this absurdly priced microtransaction seemingly got more attention than a botched patch. That's not exactly the case this time, but there are still people who hate that it even exists.

I would have guessed that in the battle between Queen and a puny probe rocket, the 600-ton monster would prevail, but the probe proves an unstoppable force. arcraiders from r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oz3a0r/queen_gets_fucking_suplexed_by_probe What I love most about the i…",

And it is, without a doubt, the most French set of TGA nominations to date. If you've been involved in any conversation this year about JRPGs, turn-based combat, dev studio sizes, parrying, or the profound absurdity of French culture, it should come as no surprise that Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is TGA 2025's most-nominated game. Including its Game of the Year nomination, Clair Obscur is in contention for 10 awards—three more than Death Stranding 2. (Image credit: Kepler Interactive) And you know how much they love Kojima over at Geoff's house, so that's saying a lot. While Clair Obscur might be boasting the most nominations, it'll still have to outvote the likes of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and the sheer cultural force of Hollow Knight: Silksong. If I know anything about Silksong fans, it's their ability to channel manic energy into a website. If you want to weigh in for the TGAs yourself before the show …",

Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick expressed just that feeling in a new interview with Squawk Box on CNBC . \"I think it's moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed,\" Zelnick said. \"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen—that's never going away.\" Zelnick's qualifying comment hints at the state of flux the game industry currently finds itself in.

We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.\" Riot confirmed the same in its own post on X, saying the sale will give the Hytale community \"its best shot at experiencing a revised version of the game.\" After evaluating multiple offers, we’ve reached an agreement to return Hytale to @simon_hypixel, giving this community its best shot at experiencing a revised version of the game.

I'm getting paid, so it's not a problem for me personally, but because my output isn't being released to the public, people see me as not working.\" While that's particularly disappointing for anyone hoping for more Yoko Taro-brand weirdness, the Nier creator is just one of many game developers who've recently had to watch their work evaporate. 2025 has continued a years-long rash of game cancellations, studio closures, …",

Joseph O'Connor, now 26 years old, hijacked over 130 accounts, including those of Apple, Uber, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Kanye West. Alongside other hackers, three of whom have been charged, they then impersonated the companies / individuals in question and used the accounts to promote a classic \"double your money\" scam. The hijacked accounts would send tweets asking followers to send Bitcoin to digital wallets, promising that the money would be doubled and returned. An estimated 350 million Twitter users viewed these dodgy tweets and, over 15-16 July 2020, a total of 426 transfers totalling 12.86 Bitcoin was made to the wallets. This would have been worth around $110,000 in 2020: now the value would be more like $1.2 million. The hack itself, as they often are, was more down to social engineering than cyber genius.

That's in descending order of importance, so far as I'm concerned. The A-Life fixes sound a lot more interesting than GSC's prosaic \"Fixes and improvements to the A-Life system\" makes it sound. If you're not familiar, A-Life is the name GSC gives to the systems in all its Stalker games that, more or less, let the games' beasts and NPCs pursue independent lives and objectives. It's always kind of an illusion, but it's an illusion that many felt was especially lacking in Stalker 2 at launch. The big change today? \"Factions can expand control over new territories.\" Which, let me be the first to say: hell yeah. \"This means they may also lose control over their lands if they fail to defend them.

Now, US Congressman Ro Khanna has weighed in on the furore, calling for proper regulations on AI use in the wake of the controversy. Responding to the social media post that triggered the debate on X (via Eurogamer ) Khanna stated: \"We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. They should share in the profits. And there should be a tax on mass displacement.\" This is not a new position for Khanna, who has been calling for regulations on how generative AI is both created and deployed in the US. In an interview with the Verge last year , Khanna provided a detailed explanation of his position on AI. He criticised both the datasets genAI systems are trained upon, pointing out that models up to that point had been \"trained with generative AI on everything on the Internet without necessarily distinguishing what is true from false\", as well as how the technology makes it e…",

As such, she sends you to Blue Gate chasing a rumour that bees have returned. I guess most bees were wiped out by the initial war against the Arc, but apparently not all of them, as you track down a bee hive in Blue Gate's Olive Grove area. Here's how to complete Bees, as well as the exact location of the bee hive. Despite having to gather some, the bees don't count as an item, so you can happily bring a free loadout . How to complete Bees in Arc Raiders You can find the bee hive in the east of the Olive Grove located in south Blue Gate (Image credit: Embark Studios) Your first step in completing Bees is to head to the Olive Grove in South Blue Gate, directly south of the Checkpoint area in the centre of the map. You might have to zoom in a bit for it to appear. This area is usually quite active, considering it's the best place to get lemons and apricots , plus olives , for Scrappy's va…",

But it shut down less than a year later as its initially strong player count slid away all too quickly. I always thought it a shame that XDefiant never got a proper chance to thrive, but I'm especially sad now that I've learned what XDefiant's failure cost us. Before they ended up making a live-service multiplayer shooter (and more recently, the superhero phenomenon Dispatch ), the founding members of AdHoc Studio were originally working on a new Splinter Cell game. According to a Bloomberg report (via GamesRadar ), former Telltale designers Nick Herman, Dennis Lenart, and Pierre Shorette joined Ubisoft in 2017, bringing the storytelling chops that made Tales from the Borderlands so well-liked into a new Splinter Cell project, which Herman was thrilled to be bringing back from the grave: \"I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalis…",
