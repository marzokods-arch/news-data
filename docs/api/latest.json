But that's just been the tip of the iceberg as to what's been done so far. The success of getting Hytale to run Windows 95 (yes, an operating system) within the game was reported by our chums over at Tom's Hardware , though it's really iamcxv7 on X that deserves all the attention, not least because they got Hytale to run Hytale , as well as the OS-in-a-game mod, and even a classic version of Minecraft (which is pretty ironic, when you think about it). COMMUNITY SHOWCASE: A community member ran Windows95 in Hytale! This was made by @iamcxv711 pic.twitter.com/mon88oDFns January 18, 2026 If you're wondering how any of this is possible, it's all because Hytale's developers, Hypixel Studios, have made the game's server code eminently moddable.

So says the Gambling Commission, a government body that regulates gambling services and activities in the UK. Very likely, few will be surprised by this conclusion. During a speech at the ICE Barcelona trade show (via Reuters ), the Gambling Commission's executive director Tim Miller said that anyone who has spent \"even a little time\" on Facebook or Instagram will have been served ads for illegal online casinos. Miller explained that Meta claims to remove any such ads when notified of their existence. But that implies Meta is unaware of these ads until being alerted to them by third parties. \"That is simply false,\" he said. According to Miller, Meta even tried to shift responsibility for sorting this all out onto the Gambling Commission. \"Their suggestion was that we should deploy AI tools ourselves to monitor and find these ads and then report them,\" he said. Miller also described Meta's searchable ad library as \"a window into criminality.\" All of this lead Miller to conclude, \"it could leave you with the impression they are quite happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking …",

Alas, it turns out that we were all just very naive, and Microsoft's software engineers had deliberately coded this functionality. Yes, I know that's blatantly obvious—it's not like Windows 95 was created out of mystic spells and ground up weevils—but back then, there was surprisingly little in the way of information about the inner workings of Windows, let alone any comprehensive guides to every function and feature. In his Old New Thing blog , Raymond Chen explains the 'secret sauce' behind what was going on with the whole shift+restart trick. Just as it does now in all versions of Windows, clicking on restart in Microsoft's then massively updated Windows 95 forced the PC to initiate a cold reboot, i.e. shutdown all processes, clear the memory, and cycle the hardware. However, holding down the shift key forced a different process: the PC wouldn't restart, just the operating system itself, displaying 'Windows is restarting' o…",

I'd be a fool not to!\") is when I find one of those 'complete your collection' sets some games have. You know the ones: they combine a bunch of games in a series, subtract the prices of the ones you already own, then slap a little discount on the remainder to tempt you into splashing out to complete the set. When you find one of those in the midst of an already-ongoing sale, making it all even cheaper? Baby, that's the good stuff. Well, joyous news: you can now share that glee with your Steam pals. As spotted by SteamDB , Valve has recently pushed a change through that means you can now purchase these kinds of bundles as gifts. The discounting feature works as it should: if you buy a bundle for someone who already has some of the games featured in it, it'll cost you less overall. I've tested this myself with some Steam friends and this Ghost Recon bundle—for those who don't have any of the games, it would cost me £43 to gift it. For those who already have some of them, it's cheaper. Image 1 of 3 Buying the bundle for me. (Image credit: Valve) Image 2 of 3 Buying the bun…",

A number of remedies were proposed, including Google's divestment of the Chrome browser (which will ultimately not come to pass ), and most pertinently right now that the search giant shares its data with rival companies. The DOJ secured this latter remedy among others back in September , with the US District Court ordering \"Google to make certain search index and user-interaction data available to rivals and potential rivals.\" Google is now asking to postpone the sharing of this data while it appeals the DOJ's ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly. To date, many have criticised how the DOJ is handling its case against Google, saying that many of its remedies so far have amounted to little more than ' a slap on the wrist .'

Sporting the monikers of Performance and Efficient core (aka P-core and E-core), with the former handling the donkey work in games and the latter used for background tasks or weighing in with thread-heavy workloads, the markedly different core designs have remained front and centre in Intel's approach to all its consumer CPUs.

From the game's opening seconds it's obvious this was a massive labour of love for Harmonix, the studio that had kicked-off the whole genre with the original Guitar Hero. Many of those involved in bringing the project to life have now given interviews for The Oral History of Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Music Game Boom , a newly released book by journalist Blake Hester, with an excerpt detailing some of those initial meetings published on Design Room . The chapter begins with some of the initial enquiries and how the project got started, largely thanks to George Harrison's son Dhani already being a fan of Guitar Hero.

The Mortuary Assistant was something of a surprise hit in 2022: A game that puts players in the shoes of a fresh-out-of-college apprentice mortician who's called into work late one night to handle some unexpected embalmings. But this, it turns out, is not a normal day at the office. Your boss had the good sense to stay home, but you are not alone: Before long you're not only preparing the deceased for their funerals, you're also conducting occult rituals to ward off demonic forces. Talk about multi-tasking! I suppose it's inevitable at this point, three years after the release of the game, but the trailer for the film adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant doesn't land quite as well for me as the game did. The game, at least in the early going, is relatively subtle: Creepy as hell, yes, but things happen slowly at first, and the tension is elevated by the inherent unpleasantness (for me, anyway) of routine mortician work.

Players were given the opportunity to vote in November as to whether they'd like the widely reviled Treasure Hunter microtransactions removed: Obviously, they said yes , and that's one of the first items on the 2026 roadmap unveiled today. The accompanying blog post states it \"represents more than a milestone; it’s a turning point—one that sets RuneScape firmly on course for the future it deserves.\" The plans detailed in the post are already in motion, as Treasure Hunter is already out of the game. Players will have the year to use up whatever items they've already bought, \"with additional chances later in the year to clear out anything that remains, before [hundreds of gameplay-impacting MTX] items are ultimately made obsolete.\" Plenty more was shown off with the new roadmap. …",

I wouldn't say you're looking at a projector as much as you're looking at a technological druid packing the Wild Shape spell. In all my years of reviewing tech it's become painfully clear that a plentiful feature set usually points to at least a couple of small caveats. No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer. Any piece of tech that can shift from projector, to soundbar, to fancy lightshow with the flick of some far-out mechanism gives me a palpable dopamine hit.

While modern headsets have come a long way, they either lack the visual fidelity to fool the eyes, the comfort to convince the body, or more likely a bit of both. The Pimax Crystal Super is an example of a headset that does a lot to solve one of these problems, while kinda forgetting about the other. The Pimax Crystal Super boasts some pretty impressive specs, but as such needs a mighty PC to run. Pimax recommends you have at least an RTX 2070 to run the thing, but realistically, if you’re running anything less than a 4080 then you’re not going to scratch the surface of this impressive display. There’s simply no reason to drop the $2,000 on this headset without a high-end PC to power it. You’re far better off grabbing a lower specced VR set-up and upgrading later.

      "body": "As you might have heard, Elder Scrolls Online is getting crossplay after 12 long years. The first murmurings about the feature came in Oct. 2025, when developer ZeniMax Online Studios confirmed to Forbes it was being worked on, and it came up again in a Reddit AMA last week when the studio said that while crossplay is still being developed, it \"won't be a 2026 item.\" In that same thread, though, executive producer Susan Kath confirmed that cross-progression is coming too: \"We will be doing crossplay and cross-prog at the same time,\" she wrote. It's hard to know when to expect the features, though 2027 is the earliest window players might see it. MMOs with both crossplay and cross-progression are exceedingly rare compared to their PC-exclusive or otherwise cordoned-off counterparts, and given what sort of trouble arises squeezing all those players together on a single platform, it's no surprise this sort of thing takes a lot of extra work. The note about cross-progression is great news, though, for anyone looking to explore Tamriel on multiple platforms. It's not clear how this will all work with PC addons, whether the game or its expansions will need to be bought again to play on …",

Here's the new trailer: The video is mostly cinematic, a stylish collection of environmental shots, fast cuts, and occasional bits of gunplay: Bungie is definitely going for a vibe here, and this trailer looks like it was built in a lab to drive hype and deliver the climax of a campaign to turn around what was looking like a full-on crisis for Bungie.

I also have to say that the whole thing really does look very nice. However, one of the last Asus motherboards I reviewed, the TUF Gaming B860M-Plus WiFi , was anything but user-friendly. That's because Asus uses one of three different Wi-Fi modules for this particular model, and there's no way of telling which one you've got without ripping the whole thing apart. That means you have to try three different Wi-Fi driver sets until you hit the right one. That's not much of a problem when you've already got Windows fully set up and running, but with Redmond making i…",

So you'd best bet that when I heard of a game where I could clean a room up and then decorate it with all sorts of furnishings however I pleased, I had a neuron activation moment. Hozy is exactly what I want when it comes to a cleaning sandbox puzzle: it's satisfying, cute, and surprisingly detailed.

At one point, Bezos recalls a time when he was in Luxembourg, visiting a brewery. \"This trip was one of the little tiny catalysts for the founding of AWS (Amazon Web Services, founded 2002), and the brewery was 300 years old. This company [had been] making beer for 300 years … they had a museum, and in that museum was an electric power generator, 100 years old. \"When they wanted to improve the efficiency of their brewery with electricity, there was no power grid, so they had to build their own power station … they made their own electricity, and at that time, that's what everybody did if a hotel wanted electricity: they had their own electric generator.\" Why was he rambling on …",

Depending on when you're reading this, it might've done it already, given the patch launches on January 20. Alright, \"kneecap\" is harsh. Blizzard's made an effort through rounds of beta testing, and continual conversations with addon developers, to try and thread the needle between functionality and form. Basically, the developer doesn't want addons to be required—but anything that's cosmetic can stay . This means obvious things, like roleplay, map, and bag addons are all fine; It also means there's wiggle room in the combat addon sphere for presentation, which is nice for customisability, but it also means that certain accessibility features made by addon creators over the years can be maintained. Or so, Blizzard hopes. This also involves a lot of class redesign.

We don't know if the strategy could have been replicated, but would it have been worse than the late Concord's legendary failure or the reaction to the recently announced Highguard, which was the final big reveal at last year's Game Awards ? Viewers expecting something like 2023's Monster Hunter Wilds reveal or the one-two Matrix Unreal Engine 5 tech demo and Matrix 4 trailer in 2021 have been taking out their frustrations on Highguard. The reveal was drowned out by hot takes calling out its \"Concord vibes\" and it received a ghastly 2,400 dislikes on YouTube compared to around 500 likes when it first dropped. There's been an assumption to some of the criticism that Highguard wanted this smoke, so to speak—an idea that if the Highguard studio hadn't splurged on such an exclusive spot, it wouldn't have earned all this ire.

When he originally spoke on the issue last October, he said on LinkedIn he was offered a role at the nascent Vantage Studios, but that \"it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.\" It was evident back then he was not enthusiastic about leaving, as he said \"I came to see myself as the captain of the Assassin’s Creed ship, someone who leaves only once every soul on board is safe. And that is exactly what I have done for as long as I could.\" Friday, Radio-Canada reported that a lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Quebec claiming $1.3 million in damages (just under a million in US currency), including two years' salary and $75,000 in moral damages.
