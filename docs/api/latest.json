      "body": "As hardware reviews go, this one has probably been the most challenging one I've ever undertaken in my three decades of testing and rating PC hardware. Not because the product is incredibly complex or difficult to use; far from it, in fact. And not because it was a bug-ridden, early-release mess either. Indeed not, as the MSI MEG X870E Godlike X Edition is probably the most stable, easy-to-use, and feature-rich desktop PC motherboard I have ever tested. The problem is in its name: X Edition. This is a limited release model, created by MSI to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its Godlike series of motherboards. Only 1,000 units will be made available, and restricted to Micro Center and Newegg in the US, and Scan in the UK. So the chances of an average PC enthusiast being able to buy one are astonishingly remote, even if you have a wallet capacious enough to afford the Godlike X Edition. So how does one go about testing and ultimately reviewing a product that hardly anyone will be able to buy? In some ways, MSI has made the challenge simple by taking a standard MEG X870E Godlike (though they're hardly what you call standard ) and upgrading the package to produce the X Edition. I mi…",

But what was too much New Vegas for an Xbox 360 disc is not nearly enough for a heavily modded playthrough on PC, and the Fallout modding community has spent weeks going over the beta with a fine-toothed comb to restore some of the most interesting things that were lost. For starters, there's an NPC who made it to the deck of playing cards in the Collector's Edition, yet was absent from the finished game. Marilyn, the second of Mr. House's securitron lady friends, is even referenced by Veronica in the finished game, so it's a relief to finally have her return.

But to get more of a sense of the impact cosplaying for social media and events has on a person, I spoke to Kaho Shibuya, author, contest host, and avid cosplayer with over 1.2 million followers on Instagram alone , to understand how she started her cosplay journey, what it's like to be so involved in the community, and any impact it's made over the years. \"I became Kaho Shibuya back in November 2014,\" Shibuya tells me. \"Initially, I was still not sure about social media, but I think I started with blogging.

Far more than just a map-pack, it aimed to replicate the specific feel of Halo 3's multiplayer as closely as possible, Halo-fying its arsenal, adjusting mechanics like ballistics and gravity to better align with Halo's Moon-hopping feel, and even throwing in authentic sound effects and announcer lines for good measure. Sadly, that's all over now. On X, Project Misriah cocreator Forddoyo posted an image of a DMCA takedown notice he had received from Microsoft via Valve. The takedown notice alleges that Misriah's \"unauthorized use of Halo game content in a workshop not associated with Halo games infringes their rights\", and as such Valve had \"temporarily removed your postings from Steam\". The crux of the issue here seems to be that Project Misriah uses assets from the Halo games, hence the use of the phrase \"Halo game content\".

Phoenix Point aimed to reimplement much of the granularity that Firaxis' slicker overhauls took out, adding features like soldier inventories, multiple human factions, manual aiming, and mutating enemies. Phoenix Point seemed to have the makings of a stone cold classic. Sadly, the result amounted to less than the sum of its parts, bogged down by bugs, repetition, and micromanagement. Then came Terror from the Void , a fan-made mega-mod that radically overhauls the experience, introducing a new story, reworking progression, and adding new mechanics like ability-changing delirium infections and zombified squadmates who would fight against you. Terror from the Void is beloved by Phoenix Point fans, with many believing it represents Phoenix Point at its best.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. As the holiday season rapidly approaches, I find my mind turning to gaming's many winter wonderlands. Over the years, we've been treated to countless beautiful icy landscapes to explore. Sure, they're usually full of people (or monsters) that want to kill us, but that doesn't make it any less charming to get to play in the snow without getting cold. Now's the perfect time to look back on some of our favourites—so I thought I'd put some together in a very chill little quiz. All you have to do is look at the screenshots of various wintery locations, and tell us which game each one is from. Simple as that, and in the spirit of Christmas generosity, I've even made it start out nice and easy. Though you might find as you go along that the later questions are snow joke… Let us know how you did in the comments—and your favourite snowy videogame location!",

Ah, the pick-up group (PUG). While MMORPGs are a social activity, let's face it—unless you have a dedicated raid night going on, it's unlikely you're going to be doing the majority of your dungeons or raids with a group of people you know. Enter the group/party finder, saviour of daily reward loops—you get matched with strangers, rock up into a dungeon, and hope to god that they are at least passably good. And for the most part, they are. MMOs have understood for a while now that casual content shouldn't be a sweatfest, and as long as everyone's mostly pushing their buttons? You'll be okay.

Because it really is crucial, even if it did take Blizzard 21 bloody years to get with the program. MMOs are, in a lot of ways, about expression. In ye olden days of the internet, there was (and still is) a game called Second Life —this game is pretty much built on top of player-submitted stuff. Custom avatars, and, more to the point, UGC residencies that take place on a \"grid\". Crucially, the thing has straight-up 3D modelling software in it, meaning players can not only look however they'd damn well please, but they can also create spaces for themselves, too.

In the last twelve months, Ironclad has introduced features like new scenarios , population mechanics, better tutorials and improved debris visuals for prettier battle aftermaths. Now, a new update takes aim at one of the RTS' weakest areas of play, that trickiest of 4X systems to implement—diplomacy. The Diplomatic Repercussions update aims to make negotiation a more interesting and viable path to victory. As Ironclad explains in a new video, at the heart of this overhaul is a significant AI rework. NPC factions have had their brains rewired to make them both smarter and friendlier than they were before. They're more likely to form alliances and forgive past transgressions, but also more tactically adept on the battlefield should diplomacy fail. These changes tie into a substantial economy overhaul aimed at encouraging diplomatic approaches.

In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one.

Hogwarts Legacy is the proverbial problematic fave: As PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde laid out in 2023, there was quite a bit of controversy when the game first launched over whether or not it was okay to play it , thanks to the notoriously anti-trans politics of author JK Rowling. Rowling wasn't involved with the development of Hogwarts Legacy but she does profit from it, and some portion of her money goes to support anti-trans organizations . But Harry Potter remains much beloved, and Hogwarts Legacy was and still is a hit: Nearly three years after it launched, there are currently more than 18,000 people playing the game on Steam alone . Unsurprisingly given that fact, the price remains pegged at the original $60. That makes Epic's giveaway—the first time Hogwarts Legacy has gone on the freebie block—a very attrac…",

The PC Gamer team is divided, so I thought I'd better give everyone a chance to state their case. But where do you fall? Let us know in the comments!

Traditional CMOS chips are fabricated by applying and then etching repeated layers of different materials, applied to a wafer of ultra-pure silicon. The bottom-most layer, also known as the front end according to MIT, comprises the transistors of the chips (or capacities, in the case of DRAM).

Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh. But on the whole, Baldur's Gate 3 is a bright heroic fantasy with bloody dark spots—it's a colourful, lively game that (unless you kill everybody) is about troubled people overcoming their worst nature and horrifying fates to save the realm.

Or so I thought… Earlier this year, Nvidia pulled support for 32-bit CUDA applications with its newest generation graphics cards, the RTX 50 series. With it gone, it's no longer possible to natively run 32-bit games with hardware-accelerated PhysX effects. Why that matters: PhysX offers a way to run some in-game physics calculations on an add-in card . That not only frees up the CPU to focus on other things, it also allows developers to put a lot more physics-based effects into their games. As such, games with PhysX effects tend to have a lot of stuff going on. If you run a game with PhysX enabled but without the hardware to accelerate it then all of the physics calculations fall on your CPU. Even on today's much faster processors, with many more cores than those around during PhysX's peak, the impact of these added effects severely limits frame rate. The CPU becomes a bottleneck. Or you turn PhysX off. Now, I'll admit, I hadn't thought about Ph…",
