If you're interested in oddities from the period you probably know Inscape as the publisher of the aforementioned Drowned God, but also Bad Day on the Midway, which was directed by members of surrealist rock troupe The Residents, and almost received a TV adaptation by—take a breath—David Lynch. Inscape was a dab hand at sicko-friendly adventures in other words, which can probably be attributed to its proximity with the film and music worlds (it was funded by HBO and Warner Music Group).

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. In the 1980s and early 1990s if you wanted a videogame with a decently written story, adventure games were the only place to find them. Back then RPGs were mostly dungeon crawls, or full of olde worlde thee-and-thou guff. Immersive sims didn't exist. Visual novels were rarely translated into English. Other genres would give you a paragraph of text and a pat on the back, then send you on your way. Because point-and-click adventures evolved out of text adventures they brought some of text's wordiness with them. When you wanted to adapt a book to a videogame, whether it was The Hobbit or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, adventure games were the way to do it. Studios like Infocom, LucasArts, and Sierra valued characters, settings, and themes more than anyone else. Of course to talk to those characters, explore those settings, and understand those themes first you'd have to solve the puzzles. Adventure games were infamous for gating progress with puzzles that mad…",

Mom's advice before she expires: \"Don't think of them as human beings, think of them as Americans.\" That's all Steph needs to hear before throat-slashing her way across the border and making her way to Las Vegas where she runs into Cooper Howard and an unconscious Hank MacLean. I guess when Hank woke up he admired her cutthroat (literally) attitude and made her one of Bud's Buds, which secured her a cryopod in the Vault. Alas, things are not going great for Steph in the present. She's getting a lot of pushback from Overseer Betty of Vault 33, and even worse, from her soon-to-be husband, Chet, who she didn't even bother informing about their impending wedding.

Part of the fun is in the discovery!\" Very few aspects of Terraria are left untouched with 1.4.5, which is available right now. There's new items galore, and a hugely overhauled crafting system with which to make them. Inventory management has been overhauled, as has world seed functionality.

I've played a lot of them and I can barely tell anymore. There's nothing wrong with Genshin Impact, but I only need so many open world action RPGs where you meet anime characters you can collect like Pokémon, and most of the copycats don't have anything else going on. Arknights: Endfield , however, does have something else going on: surprisingly robust factory building . I can't name another gacha game where you mine raw materials and process them in a maze of conveyor belts. Factorio always looked like a game I'd never click with, but Endfield has turned me into the kind of person who can spend hours reorganizing their base just to make it slightly more efficient. The problem now is that I like the factory building so much that I'm disappointed when Endfield interrupts it to make me play more of its sad sci-fi Genshin Impact-style adventure with characters that make me want to turn the sound off.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of children's digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—representing an estimated 14 million consumers in the UK. Very briefly, it alleges that Valve prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms, requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices. Valve had argued that the case should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action on a number of technical grounds, including that it will be difficult to accurately determine who is eligible to claim damages. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (via the BBC ) disagreed, however, declaring that \"the certification criteria were satisfied and it was appropriate to grant a CPO on an opt-out basis.\" A website dedicated to the action at steamyouow…",

A not-insignificant number of people immediately wrote it off, calling it dead on arrival—the next Concord , if you will.

If you've ever played a truly terrible game, a real 33%, then you'd know Highguard is far from that .

A new report says that three of the biggest players in NAND chips, the flash memory that goes into PC SSDs, are all planning on doubling their prices. Digitimes claims that Samsung is planning on more than doubling the price of its NAND chips in the first quarter of this year, \"amid tightening supply and surging demand driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence applications.\" The site further says that, \"SK Hynix has implemented NAND price increases of a similar magnitude, while Sandisk has previously been reported to be planning a 100% NAND price hike in 2026.\" That means three of the biggest players in NAND chips for SSDs all plan to double their prices, or thereabouts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Digitimes also notes that Samsung recently reported very strong financial results, with revenues up by over 22% to roughly $65 billion for the final quarter of 2025. Samsung's profits for the same period doubled to a little under $14 billion. As they say, nice work if you can get it. Many SSDs are already almost triple the price…",

According to Steam user Captain_SmellyRat (excellent), the game's resolution is tied to its post processing setting, which means lowering it drops the output resolution in turn—despite reporting otherwise in the settings menu. Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%. Turn post processing to High, and the game runs at full 4K.

We’ve always believed that players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them.\" In an interview this month, managing director Maciej Gołębiewski referred to Horses when he declared that \"We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values\". That rankled some onlookers who remembered that, well, that wasn't always GOG's stance. In 2020, it came under fire for unceremoniously dumping Devotion , which had become subject of repression in China for memes seemingly mocking president Xi Jinping. In a new interview with Eurogamer , Gołębiewski chatted a bit about how GOG looks back on that episode. \"That situation remains difficult to reflect on,\" said Gołębiewski. \"At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game…",

The company just announced on its website that \"the current situation is extremely serious—serious enough to raise concerns about the very survival of graphics card manufacturers and distributors going forward.\" That's according to X user and tech talker harukaze5719's translation , which aligns pretty closely with Google's machine translation. The company claims that not only has the price of the RTX 5090 \"increased sharply\", but also for the RTX 5060. Presumably it's referring to the price the company is paying Nvidia for the GPUs. Because of these increased prices, Zotac Korea is cutting its rewards points policy. The AI-induced memory shortage is, of course, most clearly pertinent to RAM, but it's also pertinent to GPUs because these also use memory, this being GDDR video memory. If ther…",

But not only is he completely disinterested in publishing more than around 10 games a year, focusing on stability over growth , his advice to indie developers is to avoid indie publishers entirely. \"People can hate me for this if they want,\" he says, \"but most indie publishers are not people indie developers should work with. The vast majority of indie publishers, in their whole structure, are predatory and opportunistic.\" This could all be a cunning ploy to stick it to the competition, but Hooded Horse isn't exactly struggling to find developers to sign.

It's called the OpenSplitDeck. The new version looks as chunky, if not chunkier, than the one we saw back in June last year. Though it has been massively overhauled since then with a heap of new upgrades and quality-of-life improvements. It now supports gyro controls, much like the Steam Controller, with one gyroscope in each half of the controller. Gyro functionality is, creator TommyB says, \"a little noisy\" at the moment, but he's looking into ways to improve this and use the dual-gyroscopes to better effect in-game. Each half of the controller also features a slim screen down the inside edge. One of the larger overhauls here is a shift away from Arduino to the Nordic nRF Connect SDK.
