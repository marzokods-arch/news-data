Speaking with Wildlight at a hands-on event in Los Angeles last week, several Highguard devs admitted they wished the reveal had gone down differently, but made it clear that the mixed reception didn't alter their release plans. \"Look, I wish Highguard had been received better.

But apparently we don't represent a market demographic large enough to move the C-suites of the world. So why does Nightdive keep working on them?

But there's a significant caveat hanging over the Intel Arc B390, and it goes like this: it's very, very quick— for an iGPU. Sure, it's capable of delivering gaming laptop-like performance, but compare it to any discrete mobile GPU of the current generation and the little graphics tile's limits are quickly revealed. Now, none of this is meant to cast shade upon the considerable achievement of Intel's engineers. No one was expecting its new mobile graphics hardware to compete with, say, anything from the RTX 50-series. In fact, Intel claims the Core Ultra X9 388H is 10% faster at gaming (on average) than a lappy with an RTX 4050 mobile. And, if you squint closely at those claims, you'll see that they were made in reference to a 60 W gaming laptop, with '2x upscaling' enabled.

That's primarily because it was too expensive for what it offers, especially compared to the first version. So consider me downright stupefied that Logitech seems to have raised its price, at least in the US. When I reviewed it, it was going for $100. Now it's going for $120 . To be fair, this is what happened with the original PowerPlay: it started off at $100 and was later raised to $120. But to be equally fair, I don't care, it's still far too expensive considering the downgrade from the first one. In case you don't have a clue what I'm on about, the G PowerPlay pads charge your compatible Logitech mouse—provided it has the charging puck in its underside—simply by resting the mouse on top of it. This means you never have to plug it in to charge ever again. The problem with the second version, though, is it cut back a lot of what made the first so good. In particular, the first one came with two pad toppers rather than one—one hard, one soft. And in even more particular, with the original you just had to plug in the pad in and it would not only charge your mouse but also act as the hub…",

Instead, it's primarily been found in weird hybrid tablets , ridiculously expensive handhelds , and a select few similarly expensive workstation laptops . It looks like that might soon change, though. Lenovo has been cooking up some new gaming laptops, some of which it showed off for CES 2026 (including one with a rollable screen ), and it's just hinted that a Strix Halo laptop might be in the works. Specifically, a 'Lenovo Legion 7 15ASH11', which was for a while listed as a supported model for its Legion Space software (via VideoCardz ).

Intel remains tight-lipped regarding handheld implementations of its impressive new chips, with the only word I've heard on the matter being something shown to the public \"soon\". So, I'm left with little but speculation for now. Still, we can have fun dreaming together, can't we? Handheld gaming PCs are currently in a bit of a weird space, as far as I'm concerned. Sure, there are plenty to choose from, but it's quite telling that the Steam Deck still crops up with regularity as one of the top recommendations. Its APU is really starting to show its age in 2026, and while it still makes a fantastic value proposition, I'd primarily recommend it as an indie gaming machine if you're looking for smooth performance.

Hope you're okay with zombie guts, because the cafeteria's all out of pastrami. (Image credit: Capcom) The three hours of Requiem I played, swapping between a grizzled-but-still-got-it Leon and more fragile newcomer Grace, deftly tiptoed the line between fan service and light touch reinvention. Last time we saw Leon in Resident Evil 4 Remake, Capcom had given him the ability to parry a chainsaw-wielding zombie with his knife, and he's got the same move here with a hatchet—only now when the mad doctor drops his whirring saw it goes skittering down the hallway, blade bouncing off the tile floor.

Between the two of them, you've now decided that your next gaming laptop is going to be Panther Lake-powered and sport a big GPU from Nvidia, to go with Intel's big Xe3 tile. You're possibly going to be disappointed, then, to know that you're almost certainly not going to see any such lappies coming to market. The reason why is quite simple: it all comes down to the number of available PCIe lanes in the platform controller tile. Intel has two variants of this chiplet: one with 12 lanes (four are Gen 5, eight are Gen 4) and the other with 20 lanes (eight Gen 4, twelve Gen 5). The important thing, though, is that every Core Ultra 300-series processor that has the big 12-core Xe3 iGPU uses the 12-lane platform controller tile. AMD and Nvidia's mobile GPUs are designed to use at least eight PCIe lanes. That doesn't mean you can't fit a discrete GPU alongside a 12-lane PTL chip; it's just that it will leave just four for everything else inside the laptop. The majority of NVMe SSDs require fou…",

Upon hearing Intel's battery life efficiency claims for its new, Panther Lake-based, Core Ultra Series 3 chips, I knew what needed to be done. Top up my Asus Zenbook Duo review sample overnight, take it on my round trip from my Southampton home to PC Gamer Towers in Bath (a roughly 126 mile jaunt), use it for a regular day, and record when it conks out. It's a dGPU-less machine, which means all the graphics hardware is contained onboard the single Core Ultra X9 388H chip at its heart. Despite this, the built-in Arc B390 iGPU delivers some impressive gaming performance for its size, meaning that laptops powered by Intel's new mobile chips (the ones with chonky iGPUs, anyway) can now reasonably be called gaming laptops.

How do I know this lil' guy hates humans? Well, for starters, Mochi-O straight up kills its last owner-slash-wielder-slash-commander. (Image credit: Kodansha) If that wasn't enough confirmation, I got my hands on a rather rudimentary translation device which, when asked \"what do you hate?\" the screen flashed Mochi-O's response: HUMANS HUMANS HUMANS HUMANS HUMANS HUMANS. That's probably a solid enough testimony right there. My job, then, is to not only refine Mochi-O into a weapon of war with upgrades and powerups galore, but to care for it and establish a solid bond through feeding it seeds and giving it plenty of pre-battle scritches.

But no, all we got was a single Ryzen 7 9850X3D announcement and no mention whatsoever of the vaunted dual-CCD 3D V-Cache chip. But a new EEC listing from AMD before the weekend has listed a new Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 processor alongside the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and a bunch of Threadripper chips. (Image credit: EEC) To bring you up to speed, 3D V-Cache is AMD's bespoke technology which underlays an extra chunk of L3 cache underneath the processor cores in a Zen 5 CPU package. The benefit of this is that games in particular benefit from all that extra on-die memory, reducing the number of times programs have to dip into slower system memory and therefore boosting frame rates. On chips, such as the Ryzen 9 9800X3D , and the upcoming 9850X3D, that means all eight of the CPU cores get access to a whole lot more cache. But for the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D chips, which have multiple core complex dies (CCD) to accommodate their higher core counts, only one CCD gets the extra cache. With the…",

It only just got a release date after a lengthy delay following rough playtest feedback , and after a fiasco involving some stolen art assets , studio morale took a nose dive . Former art director Joseph Cross left the studio in Dec. 2025 after six years, and last Tuesday, he unpacked his thoughts on the online discourse around Marathon in an interview with Mikhail Klimentov of ReaderGrev . Cross told Klimentov the team felt distinct \"spells\" where talk around the game was positive at first, and then became negative. \"Personally, I'm able to compartmentalize a lot of that,\" he said in the interview. \"The art is really the most important thing to me here. It's difficult for me to take any of that stuff personally because I believe in the art, because I believe in what we've done. I think we did something really cool, and I think it will pan out.\" He added that he had no say over design or \"the way the game plays,\" but \"what I could control, I feel really good about.\" \"You can't take that away from me, as much as the haters try online or wherever,\" said Cross. \"And whether someone …",

More specifically, it runs on the PineBuds Pro , which Sarkisian explains on his site are \"the only earbuds with open source firmware.\" The buds have a CPU strong enough to run Doom with some minor tweaks—the site notes Sarkisian \"cranked [the CPU] up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode,\" providing \"more than enough\" juice to run the game, albeit at around 18 fps. Doom itself also required some tweaking so that the buds' meager RAM could handle the game, but the site explains \"there are plenty of optimisations\" that can cut down on Doom's required 4 MB of RAM.

But lately, small developers have been beating the mainstream in the multiplayer sphere too. With Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 falling flat on its face and Battlefield 6 struggling to maintain its promising initial momentum, I've turned increasingly to the throwback deathmatch joys of Straftat and the cooperative combat shenanigans of 2024's Echo Point Nova . Now, new indie challenger Doku Games has entered the arena with Out of Action , a PvP FPS that aspires to be the darling of movement kids everywhere. Out of Action doesn't look all that in screenshots, with generic-looking cyborg ninjas battling in aggressively grey arenas. But it springs to acrobatic life when in motion. Its cyberpunk-ish warriors can shoot-dodge, slide across floors, run along walls, rebound off walls, and perform first-person somersaults in midair. It's enough to make Max Payne motion sick. On the subject of Max Payne , Doku Games also promises \"advanced multiplayer bullet-time\". The S…",

But he discovered that its cutesy visuals and gentle onboarding belied a game of serious puzzling depth. \"As a puzzle it becomes exponentially tricky. Each asteroid or planet only houses a small number of possible resources, making effective shipping between them vital,\" he wrote in September last year. \"It starts to feel like trying to fit all the components of a circuit board in a functioning layout on the surface of a potato.\" Up to this point, Star Birds' puzzling has been limited to synthetic resource production. Now, though, things are about to get more involved with the addition of organic production chains. Earlier this week, Toukana introduced its Flora & Fauna update to Star Birds, adding alien plants, food production, and a frankly concerning number of tentacles. Much of this revolves around the new star system players can explore. Paradeira is a green and pleasant sector of space bustling with organic life. Primarily, this life can be…",

When I'm in a cramped tunnel full of ghouls with an air-cooled automatic rifle and a depleting supply of .308 rounds, I want to be in claustrophobic first-person. When I'm jogging across the countryside in a duster, or swinging a golf club at Fiends coming from every direction, I want to be in open third-person. Modders have tended to focus on first-person animations, both because it's the more popular view and the easiest to tweak. Which is why it's taken until now for modder Wombat to bless us with a full third-person animation overhaul for Fallout: New Vegas. And yes, it does cover NPCs as well. Enhanced Animations – 3rd Person Movement is apparently the first in a series of planned Enhanced Animation mods.

This is distinct from the irregular preproduction work that came before, as well as the even more blistering, seven days a week schedule he kept during the game's final stretch in 1997. Cain would wake up at 6:00 AM, take care of his cat, then reach the office by 7:00⁠—homemade loaf of bread in hand⁠, recipe helpfully under the video's top comment—to get an early start on coding tasks when there were no meetings to interrupt him.

Before this week's pre-patch, players could create and save outfits, which would apply a sort of 'new skin' over their existing gear.

Before I played No Players Online, I knew nothing about it, except that it was a horror game set in a server for an abandoned multiplayer FPS. In some ways it is exactly that, but in others it is not really that at all. If that description seems confounding, then it is only accurate to my experience with this deeply strange game, which is at once a fairly derivative horror experience and one of the oddest puzzlers I've ever played. Even the history of No Players Online is confusing. I've been vaguely aware of the game for years, but it turns out that the No Players Online I was familiar with is not the No Players Online I just played. The commercial version that launched late last year and costs $15 is based upon a free, short game released back in 2019, developed by Adam Pype with sound design by Viktor Kraus and addit…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I love a classic videogame dungeon. Give me dark caves and dripping ceilings. Give me puzzle doors and weird keys. Give me traps under every flagstone and monsters in every room. The best dungeons are burned into my brain as some of my favourite levels of all time, lurking forever in the shadows of my memory like a gang of 2d4 skeletons. But how well do you remember your years of excursions in the underworld? Our latest quiz tests exactly that, challenging you to match each ominously titled dungeon to its game of origin. Only the kind of seasoned adventurer who knows their Underearth from their Underdark and their Dredmor from their Deadmines will prevail. It's multiple choice, so even when you're stumped you can at least make a guess—but remember that down in the dark, giving the wrong answer to a riddle can have dire consequences… Let us know how you did in the comments below!",

The Killing Stone is a card battler with demonic overtones that owes at least some of its soul to 2021's Inscryption . The meat of the experience is a simulated board-game where you play cards that come to life as little critters. These critters form up in a line on the board, fighting to destroy a lidless eye that represents each player's life. Destroy your opponent's eye and you can move on to the next battle. If your eye gets poked to oblivion on the other hand, well, let's just say the results aren't to your advantage. Surrounding this mechanical core is a narrative meta-layer where you explore the spooky house of an old magus, researching upgrades to improve your chances of beating the game and entreating with its curious denizens. As you can hear in the trailer, the game boasts some hefty voice-acting talent…",

For PC gamers with one Blood remaster already in their Steam library, the highlight of the package wasn't anything technical—it was the addition of the concluding part of one of Blood's best mods. That mod is Marrow , a new campaign for Monolith's deviously difficult and ferociously violent shooter. It's sort of Blood's equivalent of John Romero's Sigil —a continuation of Blood's storyline that concluded with protagonist Caleb slaying his demonic former master Tchernobog. Like Sigil, Marrow restricts itself to Blood's original assets (weapons, enemies etc) to power the experience, focussing instead on using those assets to build large and complex new maps for the game. Episode One of Marrow has been out for a while, releasing back in 2023. Marrow's creator, Nick Palsmier, intended to issue a general release of Chapter 2 as close to the launch of Nightdive's 2025 remaster as he could. But as he explains in a post on ModDB \"Responsibilities and life got in the way. As did a trickle of small issues.\" Still, it hasn't been that long since Blood: Refres…",

Some of these are fun, quirky spinoffs like Nightmare Kart, while others are more serious efforts to replicate Bloodborne's atmosphere. One of these is side-scrolling soulslike The Last Faith , which aims to do for Bloodborne what Blasphemous did for Catholicism and religious dogma, squeezing out its darkest juices into a 2D, metroidvania-shaped glass.

The reveal has become a case study in how not to announce a game, but what really got people worked up is what Highguard's developer did next: nothing. Highguard is launching on Steam next week, but the studio still hasn't said anything new about it publicly, aside from a tweet today announcing a livestream.
