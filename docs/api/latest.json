Ensuing weeks of heated debate have seen some longtime Battlefield veterans venting frustration with BF6's tightly-corseted combat corridors, while others have insisted those of us longing for broader battlezones are suffering from nostalgia poisoning.

How do I react? Immediately pop a shield recharger of course. Then I take one more shot to the body and die. Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.

Reports of Arc Raiders server issues began popping up on Reddit in the early afternoon (Eastern time) on November 2, as eager players ran headlong into login and matchmaking issues. The cause of the outage was no great mystery: WE PEAKED AND NOW THE ARC BROKE THE SERVERS! from r/ArcRaiders Evidence of the servers struggle can be seen on SteamDB , where a high of nearly 338,000 concurrent players was achieved before sudden palpitations threw everything into disarray.

Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board.

In a way, it feels like this was bound to happen. The day after Sora 2, the latest iteration of OpenAI's text-to-video technology, went live, PC Gamer's Jess Kinghorn described the system as capable of \"spitting out all of the soulless, AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style animation one could ever want.\" Just a few days later, someone posted a Sora 2-generated video of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman standing in a field with frolicking Pokémon, saying, \"I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us.\" All of this has attracted the attention of CODA, an organization founded in 2002 to combat piracy and promote Japanese videogames, film, music, animation, and television programs worldwide. Somewhat ironically under the circumstances, Nintendo is not a CODA member, although Studio Ghibli is. \"CODA has confirmed that a large portion of content produced by Sora 2 closely resembles Japanese conten…",

The series that put the Swedish studio on the map has been missing in action since 2018, and if the words of its creator are anything to go by, we won't be seeing another one any time soon, if ever. In a post on X discussing Avalanche Studios' cancelled game Contraband , Cristofer Sundberg stated that Swedish studio would be unlikely to make a fifth Just Cause game due to the fact that the majority of the series' key creatives have since departed the studio. Sundberg, who left Avalanche Studios in 2019, said that Just Cause 5 'would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.\" Now, it doesn't immediately follow that changes in personnel means a developer will stop iterating upon a particular series. None of Doom's original creators still work at id Software, for example, but the studio keeps making great spins on its world-changing FPS. Sundberg, however, believes that the will to make Just Cause games left with the series' key creators, a problem he says became evident during the creation of Just Cause 4 .

Consider Dragon Age; born as a CRPG, forced to live through little chips and nicks that turned it into a third-person action game with RPG elements. I mean, I get it on paper. Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element. But as we've gone on, I'm growing less and less convinced that this idea—that we simply cannot handle anything more difficult, or it'll hurt our walnut gamer brains—was ever true. At the very least, it's not true right now.

      "body": "Completing the Marked for Death mission in Arc Raiders is relatively simple in comparison to multi-region quests like What We Left Behind and Eyes in the Sky , but it does have a couple of confusing steps that might catch you out. In this mission, you're tasked by Tian Wen with investigating whether one of her caches in the Buried City has been tampered with. Thankfully, it's an outskirt location, so you don't have to worry about venturing into town to contend with patrolling Arcs or loot-hungry players. All that said, here's how to complete Marked for Death in Arc Raiders. Reach Su Durante Warehouses in the Outskirts in Buried City The Su Durante Warhouses are in the north of Buried City (Image credit: Embark Studios) Your first step in the Marked for Death quest is making your way to the Su Durante Warehouses in the north of the Buried City. This is a fairly easy location to get to, depending on your spawn, but since it's on the outskirts rather than in the centre, you can expect far fewer players and Arcs. Search for Tian Wen's cache near the Warehouses Find the cache outside the warehouse against west wall (Image credit: Embark Studios) Once you arrive at Su Durante Warehouses…",

      "body": "The future of EA has looked, well, uncertain since it got picked up in the biggest leveraged buyout in private equity history. For one thing, it's now on the hook for $20 billion in debt. For another, the buyout came from a group of investors that included Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners—founded by Donald Trump's son in law Jared Kushner. LGBT people and women more generally face repression in Saudi Arabia , while Kushner, of course, has strong ties to a Trump administration which has made attacking LGBT rights a cornerstone of its platform. The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements. That'd be a terrible idea for a lot of obvious, moral reasons, but one OG Sims designer (via FRVR ) says it would be \"existential for the business.\" Charles London, who worked as art director on The Sims 1 and creative director on The Sims 2, said that representing same-sex relationships in the earlier games was \"everything\" for the series. \"I think it's existential for the business, right?

Welcome to the Dark Place is a creepy single-player text adventure inspired by the likes of Zork and Kentucky Route Zero , which Zeekerss' has been working on for more than a decade. Speaking to GamesRadar , Zeekerss revealed why Welcome to the Dark Place had taken him so long to develop. Counterintuitively, it has to do with how easy text adventures are to make (or at least, to iterate ideas in). \"The strength of the text-based genre is that its scope isn't limited by the need to make 3D models and textures and mechanics,\" Zeekerss explained.

So, you've got the less-intimidating level one beasts like the new Tick, which resembles a chunky beige bug with big black eyes, or Elsa the dog who is fairly harmless until she takes damage.

But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell.

Created more just to see if they could rather than as an actually usable OS, @XenoPanther writes , \"Virtually nothing can run due to critical missing files such as common dialog boxes and common controls.\" The punchline, though? The Windows anti-infringement system still works , helpfully declaring that this copy of the OS is not in fact genuine. If you want to noodle around with the outrageously small OS yourself, @XenoPanther has uploaded the file list to Archive.org .

But it seems this wasn't enough to right Heart Machine's ailing vessel, as the studio began a second round of layoffs late last week. This time the cuts were focussed on the team creating the side-scrolling action/adventure Possessor(s), occurring less than a fortnight before the game is due to launch. The combined layoffs have led some players to question whether to continue supporting Heart Machine financially. In a Steam discussion , user Adam posted that it's \"hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game.\" This was apparently posted in response to the initial round of layoffs, but other users began to debate whether developers who'd had their jobs working on Possessor(s) cut would see a return for their efforts. \"I have no intention of giving money to a company that thanked them for that work by kickin…",

Which sounds like it'd be pretty tough, given his story is pretty well wrapped-up in 2077 and his actual mortal body has already been dead for decades by that game's start. Or so you might think. But that, and no other reason, is why you aren't Cyberpunk TTRPG creator Mike Pondsmith. In a recent stream (via GamesRadar ), Pondsmith sounded just as eager as Reeves to get the Hollywood star back into Silverhand's big boots. \"You know, not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again,\" said Pondsmith. \"I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me.\" What ways? Well, canny old Pondsmith doesn't say. I don't think it's hard to figure out a few plausible theories, though. You could always just say there's another chip with Johnny's engram on it, for one thing. Though personally? I'd be into some sort of prequel story that goes into m…",

It also just happens to be a really solid tactics game on top of all that, which is nice, and is why we gave it our Best Tactics award last year . I'm also not alone—if we go by Steam reviews, almost everyone who plays this thing agrees. It's got a sterling 98% \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" score for English reviews . Basically, if you like tactics games, you're probably gonna like this thing. My only complaint at the time was that its postgame felt a smidge undercooked. Tactical Breach Wizards' agents all have really interesting, and powerful, suites of abilities—and by the time you get to its final missions, you're cleanly sweeping through its challenges without much trouble.

In a trailer posted to the Aggro Crab and Landfall YouTube Channels, the Roots biome has been revealed. Though saying that, we aren't given a particularly in-depth look at what exactly that means in terms of climbing. Given that the two Scouts in the trailer are seen amongst a cluster of redwood trees, we can only assume that this biome will involve a lot of swinging between vines to reach the safety of platforms and Shelf Shrooms tucked between branches. However, one element that the trailer does hint towards is the addition of spiders. If they act in-game exactly as they do in the trailer, then these horrible critters will spring down from the top of trees and pick up Scouts.

Street Racing Syndicate arrived on PC a year later, and while it was no Need For Speed Underground or Burnout 2: Point of Impact, it found fans among those who enjoyed customizing its roster of licensed cares, free-roaming its Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Miami maps, and outrunning the police. What players didn't like was a bug specific to the PC version that made the sun blindingly bright on daylight tracks. \"HOW TO REMOVE THE SUN? LOL\" asks one poster on the Steam forum, while another laments, \"I guess the developers never heard of windshield visors or sunglasses.\" Wait long enough, and eventually a hero will come along—in this case a modder by the name of Radzerg, who just released a patch with the simple declaration, \"I've fixed the sun\".

It also comes with an interactive documentary about the history of the gory fighting series, à la The Making of Karateka . Sounds like the complete package. Yet, within days of release, 55% of its Steam reviews are negative . \"Input lag is unacceptably high in every game—even offline\" says one, with some players complaining it's even noticeable in the menus. Others are upset that \"the online's in a terrible state. Quick play matches with random people only. You can't queue for more than one game at a time, so the community's splintered between games.\" Another laments, \"The 360/PS3 MK Kollection that came out over 10+ years ago had better netcode than this\".

Knee-high bushes and other shrubbery can be toggled on or off through the foliage graphics setting, and you probably want it on \"low\". YouTuber staycation provides a good example of the difference with some bushes around a car. With the \"epic\" setting, the bushes obscure some of the ground around the edges of the car, which could make it hard to see someone at a distance. The lowest setting gets rid of them entirely, giving you a clean view to line up a shot or catch someone hiding. Notably, the foliage setting doesn't seem to affect the bi…",

Alright, let me roll up my sleeves and deliver unto you some lore . Not just any lore: mod lore . Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently. World of Warcraft has historically embraced AddOn creators with open arms, giving a ton of the game's information to them in-client through its API. Crack open the shell of any WoW raider's client and you'll find a homebrew moonshine concoction of custom raid frames, sound effects, and WeakAuras telling them what buttons to push and when. In fact, Blizzard was so dependent on its AddOn community that two things wound up happening. First, it didn't overhaul its user interface until 2022 .

Yet having watched the most recent trailer for the game, which accompanied an announcement for Legacy of Shadow's release date, I wonder whether I was a bit too quick to judge. The trailer shows new protagonist Magpie breaking into a house in New Quarter to retrieve a valuable mask.

Its first major update, Breakpoint, went some way to addressing these issues , but failed to provide the bump in players Remedy hoped for. Indeed, at the time of writing, just 25 people were playing FBC: Firebreak according to SteamDB . The actual count is likely higher given Firebreak's availability on consoles and Game Pass, but probably not by much. In early October, Remedy issued a profit warning for 2025 due to Firebreak's underperformance. Less than two weeks later, Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, stepped down with immediate effect. Now, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz , Remedy has issued its financial results for Q3 2025, posting a 32% decline in revenue versus Q3 2024, and an operating loss of €16.4 million. Unsurprisingly, Firebreak is the chief culprit, with Remedy recognising a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million due to the shooter's poor performance. Speaking in the report, …",

      "body": "Draknek and Friends is a pretty reliable puzzle-maker, dropping a new worth-playing gem every few years. Now they've released Spooky Express, an update of their delightful 2017 Cosmic Express, just in time for a little spooky-themed fall puzzling. In a round of Spooky Express, your job is to lay out train tracks so that you pick up and drop off passengers where they're trying to go. Vampires to their coffins, zombies to their graves, and humans as far away from here as they can get. The trick is that your tracks can't pass over each other, there's only room for one passenger per car, and there are fixed entrances and exits to each tiny area. The land of \"Trainsylvania\" has over 200 levels for you to figure out, with exactly the kind of thoughtful design you'd expect from Draknek. Which is to say that each area starts off fairly simple, with levels introducing new concepts and ways to use puzzle elements before delivering excellent brain-burning problems to solve with just the same materials you'd found so easily a few levels before. It runs great on Steam Deck, by the way. Very pleasing. It's also on Remote Play Together on Steam, so you can collaboratively solve with others remot…",

      "body": "Andrzej Sapkowski recently wrote a prequel to his Witcher novels, Crossroads of Ravens . At an event to publicize that novel, our colleagues at GamesRadar asked the author if he'd been involved in any part of the development of The Witcher 4. And he said, basically: nope. While explaining that the developers at CD Projekt Red did ask for advice and extra details about the setting while working on the previous games, these days apparently \"it's so rare\" that CDPR contact him to ask about the lore. Which makes sense, given how much the studio has added to it over the course of the Witcher games, like building Witcher schools based on an off-hand reference he threw in before regretting it . The other thing Sapkowski had to say about his relationship with CDPR is that, \"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now. Let's hope it stays that way.\" That was in reference to the lawsuit CDPR settled with Sapkowski in 2019 over royalties, with the author asserting that he'd handed over the rights for a pittance compared to the amount they ended up being worth. The Witcher 4 is the start of a new trilogy of Witcher games, though since it only entered full production l…",

Responding to an article by IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine about the videogame Love and Deepspace's failure to account for nonwhite characters when lighting scenes, Zelle highlighted how Volition handled that challenge in Saints Row: The Third, Skinballs. Skinballs was made up of four spheres, each textured in a different flesh tone and used by artists to ensure scenes were properly lit for characters of all potential skin colors. Borman, the director of digital preservation at the Strong, expressed his own appreciation for Skinballs , and noted that it's become a bit of a memetic delight in various mod communities, sort of like that purple checkerboard missing texture pattern you see in Source engine games. This prompted Zelle and Salvatore to realize and celebrate that Skinballs is now part of a museum collection. The Strong preserves and showcases…",

To win you'll have to build up a base of resources to keep a collection of valiant heroes fed and armed. Each time you build up a new kingdom you'll kick off with a choice of hero, like knight or priestess, as the core of your autobattling army. During the first days you'll build up a base of resources, like stone and wood, before using them to expand your production chains into the big stuff: meals. Every hero has a favorite meal to eat that lets them level up faster, a key to staying ahead of ever-escalating enemy forces. We first got a good look at Super Fantasy Kingdom a while back , and really got intrigued during the December 2024 PC Gaming show, when we saw the undead faction . The roguelike bits between waves are some of the most entertaining parts: As you explore the world beyond your little kingdom you unlock new heroes to recruit, 50-some in total, as well as small static bonuses and new buildings to diversify your economy.
