Two—they probably won't drop any time soon. Oblivion is not even a year behind us (though given its last patch was in July and Bethesda seems to have forgotten it exists, you'd be forgiven for feeling like it's been longer) and the studio is notionally working on new \" space gameplay \" for Starfield. Oh, and The Elder Scrolls 6 is bubbling away in there somewhere. It doesn't feel like a lot of space to launch a humdinger of a Fallout remaster, is my point. But fans of those games are quite keen on the notion of prettied-up versions, and a recent Steam glitch had a few of them ready to declare that the prophecy would soon be fulfilled (by which I mean: a remaster or two were imminent). Fans over on Reddit have noticed something hinky going on with Fallout 3 and New Vegas over on Steam. Namely, the fact that if you try to leave a user review for either of those games at the moment, you'll be blocked from doing so, and get a big block of red text that says \"You must wait until this product has been released before writing a re…",

That's 115 versus 183. In December, Microsoft addressed just 65 vulnerabilities, 18 from non-Microsoft services.

Going from a yearly \"chapter\" formula to a seasonal structure where, in a recent conversation I had with executive producer Susan Kath and game director Nick Giacomini, \"nothing is off the table.\" A huge part of this shift has been in addressing long-standing quality-of-life complaints: Update 49 will begin to tackle a ton of long-standing bugbears, such as the time it takes to train mounts, after Zenimax put together a dedicated team whose job is to listen to community complaints and nip them in the bud. Or, as Kath puts it, a team with a \"mandate of: Let's find out what everybody wants to do, and let's do that.\" Some of these planned changes have been a long time coming, and while it can be easy to wonder why a team might drag their feet on such tweaks, Giacomini explains that a lot of these fixes have been a thorn in the developer's paw for a while, as well. \"We communicate with our players, we read, we listen, we play the game—it wasn't like we were blind to the things that players were …",

If you're on the go, there are even free Android and iOS app versions of the map .

It's surprisingly bold, then, that upcoming game Talystro turns that entirely on its head. On this little mouse's quest, the goal is instead to make specific numbers. Enemies don't have health, they simply are a number—as low as one or, in my experience so far, as high as 55 (terrifying!). To kill them, you need to generate an attack that meets that number exactly—only an 11 will beat an 11, or a 23 for a 23. In other words precision, not power, is king. (Image credit: Filiokus) Each round you roll a set of dice and draw a hand of cards. Dice slot into spaces on the cards, which add or subtract from their result in different ways. All cards with dice currently slotted contribute to your total attack number—once it's where you want it, you can launch it and destroy an enemy. It's partly a game of maths—faced with a set of numbers and modifiers, you're looking for the most direct ways to reach specific results. But it's also about resource management. With only so many dice and slots each round, the trick is using what you have as efficiently as possible. (Image cre…",

As entertaining as Robb and Hansen's well-established rapport is, the full 40-minute interview is also eye-opening . For a start, while we already know AI is a big reason why we're experiencing a supply crisis , Robb eloquently communicates the sheer scale of the industry's hunger for memory. He puts it in stark terms for Hansen, \"The AI companies bought, like, 40% of the wafer production. We're not even talking finished goods, like, packages—not even chips. They're just wafers.\" And what's even wilder is that a lot of that stock may not even be in active use, instead hoarded in storage as the industry struggles to find sufficient power to fit out functional data centers.

Unfortunately, the certificates it relies on to carry out this task are expiring in June this year, which has kicked Microsoft into action to start issuing replacements to PCs in need of them via Windows updates. The latest security update, KB5074109 , will start a process of checking whether a PC is using the expiring Secure Boot certificates (2011 CA) and provide the newer certificates (2023 CA) if so. As Microsoft notes, many existing PCs have these newer certificates already. The CA 2011 certificates are the original Secure Boot certificates and Microsoft recommends OEMs ship the newer CA 2023 certificates with Windows 11 25H2 devices to prevent issues when the older certificates expire. However, there may still be some machines without the latest certificates, and come June, Secure Boot can no longer be trusted to verify firmware modules if that's still the case. \"Many Windows PCs manufactured since 2024 already have the updated 2023 certificates\" Microsoft says in a blog post . \"For the remaining devices, Microsoft is delivering…",

Also, Arc Raiders developer Embark is still lukewarm on the stuff despite controversially using it during its development cycle. Larian, ostensibly one of the more influential studios out there, got thrown in deep water for AI use during concept art iteration and then decided to not do that , despite continuing to tinker in other areas. How useful this tech actually is on a practical level (you know, when software companies aren't mandating employees use it or complaining that nobody likes it ) remains to be seen. Stellar Blade director Hyung-tae Kim reckons he knows the future, though, speaking at the 2026 Economic Growth Strategy briefing on January 9 (thanks, Automaton ).

And it's those chips that go into 128 GB configurations. And thus it's the 128 GB option that's been hit hardest. By way of example, until these price changes, Framework was charging $799 / £799 for a 32 GB Framework Desktop Mainboard with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 chip . Now it requires $839 / £839, so not too painful a premium. Step up to the 64 GB variant with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395 and $1,299 / £1,299 has become $1,339 / £1,339. Again, that's not entirely catastrophic. So, the real pain is reserved for the 128 GB option with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395. That was $1,699 / £1,699. But it's now $2,159 / £2,159.

Unfortunately for dog lovers, you will have to go with a cat first as part of the quest, but if you speak to Mrs. Joan straight after, she'll start talking to you about the dogs.

Despite the lack of a battle, it is nice to see typically too-cool-for-school Ghoul absolutely terrified, and we know why: he was maybe the first person to ever see a deathclaw in the wild in Alaska, and even after 200 years they still make his irradiated blood run cold. It's not a great sign for New Vegas that deathclaws have moved into the Strip, though on the other side of the fence at least Freeside is looking busier and more bustling than it ever has. Those deathclaws are now between The Ghoul and Hank MacLean, who's holed up in the secret management Vault-Tec vault The Ghoul has never managed to find—the one he believes contains his missing wife and daughter.

Any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles is strictly prohibited in accordance with our existing policies prohibiting impersonation and intellectual property infringement. The announcement comes after a surge in awful AI-generated music acts last year. The most infamous was probably The Velvet Sundown : at its peak the non-existent psych-rock four-piece was attracting 500,000 monthly listeners, but now generally only attracts around 160,000. Mind you, that is still a heck of a lot, especially for music so bland it sounds unmistakably like AI (though the same could have been said for Wolfmother in 2005, had generative AI existed back then).

If you're stuck in After Hours you're supposed to send an email to Sarah, who is actually an automated Gmail address that will check your message for keywords and then reply with relevant hints.

So it's genuinely great news that Hytale, which was cancelled last summer by Riot, beat the odds and had what sounds like a massive launch today , with preorders securing enough funds to support several more years of development . No matter what, that's a remarkable achievement for a game that was all but dead and buried just a few months ago. And after spending some time today in Hytale today, I can already see the years of work that went into it. I can also see, as the devs warned us before launch, that it's got a long way to go.

I found a hefty deposit early on, and I've smelted it all down into iron ingots for making fancy weaponry and armor. If you're in the same boat, don't worry—I'll set you on the easier path to survival with a quick rundown on how to get iron in Hytale , including what you'll need to mine deposits and process your ore haul. Where to find iron in Hytale Look along cave walls for small deposits of iron. (Image credit: Hypixel Studios) You can find iron in Hytale by exploring underground caves in any of the Emerald Grove biomes. I found plenty of iron deposits close to the entrance of a few deep tunnels near where I spawned in the grassy meadows. It also seems like the deeper you go into the caves, the more iron you'll find, but be prepared for tougher cave-dwelling monsters and pitch-black darkness. It's also pretty easy to get lost, so take extra care if you're still in the early game. I've died to just as many spiders as bears thanks to \"just one more node\" greed.

The classic desktop designed for mouse and keyboard was gone, based on a prediction that soon everyone would want to use all their devices in the same way (this has still not come to pass). At the same time Microsoft's UI designers performed an all-time beefing-it maneuver, its business geniuses rolled out a new Apple-inspired Microsoft Store and method of locking down apps that spurred Valve's Gabe Newell to declare \"Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space\" and start investing into Linux development. It was truly the nadir of Windows' 40 year history—and is now proof that there's an audience for literally everything, because someone has made a Windows 8 desktop environment for Linux.

I got, well, two answers. The first, from Gołębiewski, was straightforward: \"Yes, we are.\" In fact, GOG has made Linux \"one of the things that we've put in our strategy for this year to look closer at.\" Alas, that's pretty much all the detail he's willing to give. \"I don't want to commit to any specifics, but certainly you will see this trend, and we also see that Linux is close to the hearts of our users, so we probably could do bett…",

But I've tested it, and it's true. This saga all started when a viewer of streamer Nickmercs noticed Nick's aim snapped onto Arcs (the bots in the game) as he was shooting. Nick uses a controller, which is key to the whole affair. After some took to accusing the previous Faze member of cheating , others discovered that the aim assist for controller players appears to be stronger in Arc Raiders, the higher your fps is. With the PC Gamer RTX 5070 Ti rig, I set everything to low, dynamic lighting to static, and resolution to 1080p and managed to get up to 300 fps without frame generation. It's possible to cap the frame rate in the game's settings, so I have all I need to test this theory out. I discovered that Reddit is actually right about this one. Shock horror, I know.

While editing his article I've been scrubbing through the video benchmarks on the page, and while you're not always seeing a huge performance difference in terms of frame rates, you're often seeing a big delta between the power draw of the two DLSS models.

For years, GOG has marketed itself as the videogame storefront with values: preserving games, keeping them DRM-free, and letting you actually own them. But values have a tendency to fall by the wayside in the tumult of a corporate sale. Players were concerned. But perhaps there's comfort to be taken from the fact that GOG's new boss is, quite literally, the same as the old boss. The store was acquired by Michał Kiciński, its original co-founder, under the explicit banner of preserving its integrity and mission statement. (Image credit: GOG) \"I think it has a very solid foundation as a company,\" Kiciński tells PC Gamer. \"Good results, a very good brand—known, respected—with very clear values, and customers love it and stand behind it.\" Plus, Kiciński has a sentimental attachment: \"The less business[-y] reasons [for buying GOG] were: I'm kind of a parent of the company.

So rather than another day of doom and gloom talking about the rise of AI and the memorypocalypse , let's look at some positives. Probably the most important area we saw really exciting developments in was OLED monitors. One of the biggest problems with these that has probably stopped a lot of people from taking the plunge and buying one—alongside high price tags and worries about burn-in—is text fringing. OLED panels look fantastic for gaming, but for other things, they haven't always been the best choice, because small, thin, and wriggly little shapes such as letters (the most common little digital wrigglers) have tended to look a little fuzzy when displayed on an OLED panel. That's because of the way OLED displays its pixels. As a refresher, there are two main types of OLED panels: QD-OLED, from Samsung, and WOLED, from LG.
