All good investment firms have a manifesto, right? This one argued for making bold bets on risky, world-changing technologies rather than chasing the tepid mundanity of social software startups. What followed, however, was a decade that got even more mundane. Messaging, ride hailing, house shares, grocery delivery, burrito taxis, chat, all manner of photo sharing, games, juice on demand, and Yo. Remember Yo? Yo, yo. It was an era defined more by business model disruptions than by true breakthroughs—a time when the most ambitious, high-profile startup doing anything resembling real science-based innovation was … Theranos? The 2010s made it easy to become a cynic about the industry, to the point that tech skepticism has replaced techno-optimism in the zeitgeist. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans more than improving the world.

Picture all of it—every block and intersection, every neighborhood and park, as far as you can see—covered in sheets of paper. Now picture that paper filled with numbers. That’s one way to visualize a large language model, or at least a medium-size one: Printed out in 14-point type, a 200-­​billion-parameter model, such as GPT4o (released by OpenAI in 2024), could fill 46 square miles of paper—roughly enough to cover San Francisco. The largest models would cover the city of Los Angeles. We now coexist with machines so vast and so complicated that nobody quite understands what they are, how they work, or what they can really do—not even the people who help build them. “You can never really fully grasp it in a human brain,” says Dan Mossing, a research scientist at OpenAI.

Those bump into other atoms, splitting them and causing them to emit more neutrons, which bump into other atoms, continuing the chain reaction.&nbsp; That reaction gives off heat, which can be used directly or help turn water into steam, which spins a turbine and produces electricity. Today, such reactors typically use the same fuel (uranium) and coolant (water), and all are roughly the same size (massive). For decades, these giants have streamed electrons into power grids around the world. Their popularity surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.&nbsp; A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.

Hyperscale AI data centers bundle hundreds of thousands of specialized computer chips called graphics processing units (GPUs), such as Nvidia’s H100s, into synchronized clusters that work like one giant supercomputer. These chips excel at processing massive amounts of data in parallel. Hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables connect the chips like a nervous system, letting them communicate at lightning speed. Enormous storage systems continuously feed data to the chips as the facilities hum and whir around the clock.

      "body": "For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. A sodium-ion battery works much like a lithium-ion one: It stores and releases energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. And while today’s sodium-ion cells are not meaningfully cheaper, costs are expected to drop as production scales. China, with its powerful EV industry, has led the early push. Battery giants CATL and BYD have invested heavily in the technology. CATL, which announced its first-generation sodium-ion battery in 2021, launched a sodium-ion product line called Naxtra in 2025 and claims to have already started manufacturing it at scale. BYD is also building a massive production facility for sodium-ion batteries in China.&nbsp; And the technology is already making it into cars.

They tested it in human cells, mice, and monkeys, and KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old . He later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well.
