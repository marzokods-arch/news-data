Reportedly, the total cost of the build was $218, about a third of the going rate in Russia for a 32 GB DDR5 stick. Nice.

Noctua recently took to its roadmap website ( archive from September 2025 ) to adjust the planned release of some upcoming gear. Notably, the Pulsar Feinman Noctua edition and NF-A12X25 G2 chromax.black have moved from the first quarter (Q1) of 2026 to Q2, and the Antec Flux Pro Noctua edition is now the only product set for release in Q1. The Pulsar Feinmann Noctua Edition, being a neat mouse with a fan in it , intrigued us last year, and a potential launch in Q2 means it will be here in time for the hottest months of the year. From Q2 estimations in the last roadmap, the 140 mm desk fan, USB fan controller and Seasonic Prime PX HPD Noctua edition have all moved back to Q3 this year. If the desk fan is anything like the 120 mm NV-FS1 , it will be pricey and very cool. I can't help but feel like there's a missed opportunity in not launching in the height of the summer, though. However, perhaps the best news in this roadmap update is that the al…",

But it is different, I promise. From the blurb, it sounds like basebuilding will form a key part of the whole Palworld Official Card Game experience , much as you can in the videogame. \"Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory. These adorable and dependable Pals will utilize their own unique traits to lead you to victory.\" And that's about all there is to know at this point, though you can watch a video where a bunch of different Pals burst out of playing cards if that appeals.

The Seattle offices of Valve Corporation—a plucky upstart company co-founded by Washington businessman Gabe \"Gaben\" Newell—must have been abuzz recently, when its videogame storefront Steam pipped a steamy milestone in its concurrent user metrics. Sorry, I've written so many articles about Steam's concurrent user records that I decided to try talking about it like a local news channel covering a bake sale, just to see how it feels. Anyway, over the weekend (Sunday, to be exact), Steam broached the 42 million concurrent user limit, hitting a new record of 42,042,778 users online at the same time (per SteamDB ). Not a bad way to kick off the year, if you're a titanic videogame storefront. Which, yes, on the one hand, is hardly a surprise. Steam's growth has been relentless and undaunted for ages. It hit 41 million in October , 40 million in March , and 39 million in December 2024 . I suspect I will see you back here in a few months when it hits 43 million. On and on it goes. But! Credit where it's due: these are fairly bleak times for this whole PC gaming thing. Also, the entire rest of society, but let's stay focused. As you're no doubt excruciati…",

The AI boom has led to ever-increasing investment into the company, and so it's really in Nvidia's interest for the world to be all in on the potential benefits of AI. Huang reflects on the AI naysayers in a recent interview with No Priors (via Business Insider ). The Nvidia leaders and No Priors hosts Elad Gil and Sarah Guo venture down a lot of paths during the nearly 80-minute conversation, including what happens to jobs under an AI future, and when we might see a 'god AI'. One key point is the various narratives around the ethics of the machine learning tech. Huang argues the world of the future is one where AI leads to more jobs: \"People say, 'gosh, all of these robots that we're talking about. It's going to take away jobs'. As we know very clearly, we don't have enough factory workers. Our economy is actually limited by the number of factory workers we have.\" Huang therefore argues that robotics will lead to a huge repair industry, and that will naturally lead to more jobs.

Based on the official countdown , Hytale launches at 7 am PST on Tuesday, January 13 , finally letting everyone get their hands on the game after seven long years of waiting. It launches simultaneously across all regions (and there's no advanced access), but take note that Hytale's early access is only available on Windows PCs right now—Mac and Linux support is coming later.

Ranking highest on our top 100 list for years, until Baldur's Gate 3 came along, this all-timer RPG is currently around $3 on Fanatical. That's because it's part of the Best of Platinum Collection on Fanatical, which is a real doozy. In case you're not familiar with how these deal bundles work, you can get three to four games for $3.33 a pop, five to nine games for $3 each, or over 10 games for $2.90—basically, your minimum spend is at least $10, but you are getting some solid value for some excellent games (prices in GBP are the same, which isn't how conversion rates work, Fanatical). The list includes: Fallout 76, which I hear is actually pretty good nowadays Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition, which is worth it by virtue of being Fallout: New Vegas Fallout 3, which I'm blood-pact obligated to tell you is inferior to New Vegas, but still worth playing Disco Elysium, a game PC Gamer absolutely loves to bits , myself included DOOM (2016), a real solid FPS by any metric Robocop: Rogue City, which caused our very own And…",

It conspicuously did not appear at the CES show , but it's now been spotted in an Intel Panther Lake driver package, keeping hopes just barely alive. As we understand it, somebody at the CES show rifled through the driver files of a laptop demo'ing Intel's new Core Ultra Series 3 chip and found references to the increasingly mythical G31 GPU . Someone downloaded the graphics driver for a Panther Lake laptop model and discovered that the folders include firmware for the BMG-G31Driver link: https://ftp[dot]hp[dot]com/pub/softpaq/sp165501-166000/sp165849.exe pic.twitter.com/S0Jr8v1AN2 January 10, 2026 We have, of course, seen what feels like countless references to B770 or G31 over the past year or so . But the card stubbornly refuses to make an official appearance. It could be that Intel has never been planning to release such a GPU for the consumer market, and all of these rumours and leaks are for nought. But if the B770 is real, why didn't it appear at CES? There are a number of theories. One possible factor is the ongoing memory price crisis, and Intel ma…",

Even then Anthem had its diehards, and the patches and updates that followed addressed some of its more significant flaws. Not enough to save it unfortunately, but enough to guarantee a small but dedicated community of Freelancers who have suited up and returned to Fort Tarsis for the final day before EA pulls the plug on Anthem for good . Our Lauren Morton is one of the players who logged on to say goodbye. \"It's not empty,\" she says, \"but it is quiet.\" There are Twitch streamers running missions until the end, and high-level veterans \"waving and jumping and emoting\" around the Launch Bay.

But there is one specific bird sound, a tremolo warble that I know from Age of Empires, which I seem to hear more than anything else. Mostly it's in pop songs. It plays repeatedly over the outro of Anaconda by Nicki Minaj , and you can hear it in Babylon by Lady Gaga . It's in Pacific State by 808 State and Animals Beat by Skrillex . It's in multiple tracks by Aphex Twin. I think it's in Michael Jackson's Thriller, but that might be a different sample of the same call, and I'm halfway convinced it's been used in heavily processed form in Lana Del Rey's Million Dollar Man . According to Who Sampled , it's in at least 190(!) tracks. Basically, anywhere someone wants things to sound a bit wild and maybe like you're in the jungle, this is the go-to bird cry.

Things picked up speed toward the end of the year, however, with a major patch arriving in December that introduced a rework to core systems and an overhaul to castle construction. It seems Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse are keen to maintain that momentum in 2026. In a Steam update , Hooded Horse's CEO Tim Bender provided a detailed rundown of what's coming to the management sim this year. The most immediate planned change is a new upgrade level for the Burgage Plot—Manor Lords' basic homestead that can be expanded and tailored to a variety of uses. Burgage plots currently have three upgrade levels, but Slavic Magic is adding a new level, which exists between 2 and 3. \"Its goal is to more smoothly bridge the gap between early and late-game housing\", Bender explains. Alongside this, Slavic Magic is also considering shifting certain workshop progressions to later in the game, tying baker extensions to level 3 Burgage Plots to encourage use of the early-game communal oven, and also doing the same with cobbler ext…",

An example he gives in the video is RPG romance. Whether you loved or hated how horny Baldur's Gate 3 was, it's clear that romanceable party companions are as popular as they are polarizing—and Cain said he's been pressured to include them even though they aren't to his taste.

That Gamesradar article mentions an interview Game File (readers may encounter a paywall) conducted with Peak developer Aggro Crab.

The team didn't receive a gift from Valve in 2024 despite pulling in the right amount of cash from that game, which stung; when Kaman emailed Valve about it, he got an apology.

That being said, I have bad news, #SlorkNation: Valve has melted Slork's wet, slippery body into Sunday dinner. Let me back up. Slork was a hero concept first accessible via console commands in Deadlock's private test. He was later added to the hero labs, a feature where characters with placeholder art could be used to queue up for normal games during scheduled hours, assuming you had a certain number of games under your belt. At this point, Slork had been renamed to the decidedly less hilarious Fathom. Deadlock has spent the last year shifting forms like the MOBA version of an Animorph, and the hero labs mode was removed as the game became increasingly polished and all play was subsumed into a single ranked queue. Four of the eight hero labs characters were added to Deadlock's core roster permanently. The others, including Fathom, were simply removed.

The prevailing theory in that thread is swimming, which makes sense; both Original Sin games and Baldur's Gate 3 all funnel players onto a beach through their intros, and shores flanked by inaccessible water has sort of become the studio's signature the same way Bethesda seems fixated on starting each Elder Scrolls game in a prison.

This problem came to a head last year, with Riot promising to cut back on supplementary utility powers to reorient Valorant back around gunplay. This initiative is set to continue through 2026, with Valorant's latest patch introducing a new gun as Riot promises more extensive weapon reworks in the future. That new gun is called the Bandit, a semiautomatic pistol designed to fill the gap between the silenced Ghost and Valorant's high-powered revolver, the Sheriff. The Bandit gives players a higher rate of fire than the Sheriff and superior damage compared to the Ghost, able to deal instant kills on headshots against lightly armoured players.

But after blasting through both Freelancer's budget and its planned two-and-a-half-year development cycle, Digital Anvil was acquired by Microsoft. Roberts left the company shortly after the buyout—though he remained involved with Freelancer as a creative consultant. Freelancer eventually released in 2003, more than three years later than originally planned. Its cinematic, arcade space combat was generally well liked. But the game was also criticised for being simplistic compared to other space sims—a consequence of Microsoft scaling down the project following their acquisition of Digital Anvil. There's always been a cohort of fans who have wondered what Freelancer might have looked like if Roberts realised his initial vision. Now, a subset of that cohort has just released its own, unofficial sequel to Freelancer, developed over a timeframe that makes the original game's creation look rapid by comparison.

For a quick definition, I think \"save scumming\" is best understood as using a game's save/load feature for anything other than quitting the game and coming back later, or continuing from a game over⁠—no moral judgement here, mind you, just an observation of our tendencies. The incentive to save scum could be argued to be a design failure, or merely a natural function of games as wish fulfillment.

Occasionally a different mode is introduced with a new map, but those rarely receive much support—League has been focused on refining a single map and mode of play for nearly two decades now. Dota gets a little sillier —okay, a lot sillier —and Heroes of the Storm prioritizes breadth over depth with all sorts of smaller maps, but the average MOBA feels familiar each time you return. Three lanes, kill creeps for gold, buy a consistent number of powerful items, try not to pass out from sheer anger when it all goes wrong. Valve's Deadlock , on the other hand, has spent the last year rocking the boat frequently with no warning or restraint.

The community went feral campaigning for their favorites . …",

Borislav Slavov, the creator of the Baldur's Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2 soundtracks, is composing the music for the studio's next game, Divinity . \"We wouldn't be able to stop him even if we wanted to,\" Larian boss Swen Vincke responded when asked about Borislav's return during today's AMA on Reddit . \"He's been very busy composing and recording new material. It's pretty great.\" It's not entirely a surprise: Slavov posted on X that \"we are back\" when Divinity was revealed at The Game Awards in December 2025. Still, it's nice to have official word from the top, and the interest in Slavov's return runs deep enough that the question was asked twice. Larian publishing director Michael Douse fielded the second one, writing, \"Bobby never left. He's cooking.\" (They call him Bobby, you see.) Slavov began working with Larian on Divinity: Original Sin 2 after the unexpected death of Kirill Pokrovsky , the composer on every Divinity game through Original Sin, in 2015. Pokrovsky was well-known and loved among the Larian fan base, but as tough as his act was to follow, Slavov has done an admirab…",

Some threads just scream \"this guy is totally going to shoot me when I turn around,\" and others carry an air of indifference, whimsy, or niceness. It's never polite to judge a book by its cover, and that's not what the author of this list is advocating for, but it sure can come in handy in this game. \"Wanted to make a chart of my experience since I've also noticed patterns in general behavior per outfit, based on this post from earlier,\" abeetabee wrote. \"Obviously this isn't true for everyone that wears one of these outfits.\" The tier list only includes outfits that they've personally encountered often enough to assess, but at 30 total outfits judged, it's a decent spread of Arc Raiders' current wardrobe.

After years of asking for it, Diablo 4 players are finally getting leaderboards—and a new mode to go with them—in its next update. Blizzard calls it The Tower and it's coming in a patch on January 12 as a beta mode that promises to improve over time. It's basically a multi-level dungeon where you slay monsters for a high score, leveraging both speed and power to clear your way to a final boss. Diablo 3 players will recognize this format as an updated version of Greater Rifts, a super endgame mode for players who are pretty much done perfecting their builds. To even the playing field, there are pylons scattered throughout The Tower that give you a big boost in damage when you destroy them. We won't know until it comes out if they're worth playing around, but I think it's Blizzard's way of giving less-than-optimal builds a chance to compete with people who adhere to the meta. Leaderboards have been an important part of action RPGs since Diablo 2. In a genre about becoming a demon-slaying god, it can be fun to see how …",

Simultaneously though, it made sure to mention that a huge portion of the team is working on \"the next evolution.\" Here we go again. In its start of year blog post today, EA says it is \"committed to singleplayer life simulation experiences,\" and reiterated that it is continuing to work on updates and improvements to The Sims 4. After that, it coyly adds: \"Singleplayer PC and console experiences will always be a part of our future, with more than half of our global development team dedicated to The Sims 4 and the next evolution.
