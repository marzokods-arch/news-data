      "body": "Every year there's space penciled into the PC games release calendar for an unlikely indie game hit to blow the doors off the Steam charts. This year it was Schedule 1 that had my group chat in a chokehold for several weeks. If you missed out on the drug-dealing crafting sim back in March, you're not out of the game for good. It got a pretty big \"Cartel Update\" back in August and has now hit the Steam Autumn Sale with a juicy 30% discount. Despite the goofy-looking characters, we clocked early on that Schedule 1 isn't just a meme game and that it totally gets around the crafting game malaise by turning crafting into fun minigames . There's your free talking points for any friends who skipped the initial wave on this one who you may be able to twist into getting it on sale. It's me; I'm the friend in the group chat who missed it and is feeling a bit tempted by the discount. You can snag Schedule 1 on Steam for $14/£11.72 until the Autumn Sale closes next week on October 6, which isn't bargain bin but is a nice cut out of the $20 it normally goes for. Schedule 1 has actually already had a 30% discount during this year's Summer Sale and in early September, so you can probably count o…",

It's the biggest leveraged buyout in history, meaning that the new EA is instantly saddled with $20 billion of debt, and will face intense pressure to crank those profits.

Publisher Reef Entertainment announced today that the planned October 31 release date has been bumped to November 26 , for a pretty simple reason: Global financial instability. \"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector's Editions,\" the publisher wrote. \"Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.\" The Terminator 2D: No Fate Collector's Edition is a pretty swanky package, with a Steelbook case and collector's tin, art book, flipbook, a \"premium metal paperweight,\" two cloth posters, a fake arcade token, and more.

      "body": "Grand Theft Auto 6 won't just be the biggest game of 2026: it's the first series entry since the departure of several Rockstar big-hitters who've been involved almost from the start. Things didn't go so well for longtime GTA producer Leslie Benzies, whose studio Build A Rocket Boy released MindsEye earlier this year. That was a bit of a disaster, to the extent the developer immediately went through a round of layoffs . Another departure was Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar who left in 2020 to establish Absurd Ventures, which is so far living up to the name by releasing a graphic novel, an audio drama, a novel, and recently announcing the Absurdaverse . Before leaving Rockstar, Houser was a lead writer on every GTA game since GTA London 1969 (released in 1999), and with GTA5 first releasing in 2013 it's not unreasonable to think he may have had some involvement there. Not so. In a new interview with IGN Houser says he had no involvement with GTA 6: \"They're always a new story. It's not going to be a story I wrote or a character set that I developed, but I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure.\" Houser's asked if it'll be a bit weird playing a new GTA…",

And historically, yes, this is true: The 2024 sale began on November 27, the 2023 Autumn Sale arrived on November 21, and the 2022 edition came our way on November 22. Well, things have changed. Valve said back in February that the Autumn Sale would fire up a couple months early for 2025: It didn't say why, but the obvious guess is to put more room between it and the Steam Winter Sale: In previous years, the big year-ending blowout would kick off just a couple weeks after the end of the Autumn Sale, and that's just not enough time between two of the biggest videogame sales of the year.

This week I've been: continuing to play way too much Borderlands 4 and waiting for Battlefield 6. One thing that surprised me from the Battlefield 6 beta back in August was that Battlefield Studios seemed to be aiming for a more casual, fast-paced experience. Smaller maps are one thing, but the remarkably frictionless weapon handling seriously ramped up the speed of shootouts and all but removed the need to tap or burst fire at longer ranges. Simply by slapping a single-port brake or the basic folding vertical grip on any weapon would immediately resolve any recoil issues. In this way, the Battlefield 6 beta felt an awful lot like a battle royale—Call of Duty Warzone being the elephant in the room—in which weapons are highly efficient at way further ranges than they really should be. It was a shame, considering Battlefield has long prided itself on being more realistic/grounded/authentic (you name it) than Call of Duty. It's also ironic, given that Battlefield 6 will actually have a battle royale component, and I've no doubt this more streamlined weapon handling was designed with…",

But there's one relatively modern trend that I think is starting to turn from the sublime into the ridiculous, and that trend is slapping screens on components that really, really don't need them. Now, before I go full on \"old man shakes fist at cloud\", I'm going to start off with a heavy caveat. I can appreciate that, for some people at least, CPU temperatures are a major concern. Hidden underneath a substantial water block, or a skyscraper-esque tower of an air cooler, your machine's processor is a mysterious beast. Modern chips have a tendency to run hot, and can clock themselves down significantly if they hit their thermal ceiling. Plus, case windows are definitely here to stay. So, providing a large screen directly on top of a water block for at-a-glance CPU temp read…",

Curry actually made a similar announcement almost exactly a year ago, releasing a video in which she announced there would be \"no more gaming videos\" from her—in effect, that she was retiring from the Let's Play life. But the following December, Curry felt the Skyrim urge once more and returned to the game, and even fired up Oblivion Remastered in May to check out Cyrodiil for the first time. So it's entirely possible that Curry might change her mind once again, and have a second come-to-Todd moment after a well-earned rest much like she did before. But I wouldn't put any bets down to that effect. Curry sounds tired, and in particular she doesn't seem to be getting the things she wants from her Skyrim uploads. \"I have a few older regular viewers\", Curry said, \"but most of them seem to be very young k…",

Capcom and Square Enix teamed up during Tokyo Game Show this weekend to show off a little more of the crossover. Monster Hunter: Wild's half is out right now—with hunters able to take on Omega Planetes—while Final Fantasy 14 joins the party on October 7 with The Windward Wilds trial that lets Warriors of Light face off against Arkveld. Even skimming through Final Fantasy 14's portion of the showcase this weekend, the encounter with Arkveld felt considerably more MMO-y than Monster Hunter. Which sounds daft, but not so much when you compare it to the game's previous collaboration with World which introduced a fight against Rathalos. While it was still quite MMO-like—it was literally in Final Fantasy 14, after all—it felt like there was a real concerted effort to integrate as much Monster Hunter madness as it could. That meant a lot of untelegraphed moves, huge knockbacks, and the abil…",

Creative director Graeme Timmins has already agreed as much, noting the infamous knives \" will get addressed \", alongside some unintentional interactions and broken builds, very soon. For those living under a rock, the Penetrator Augment that can drop on throwing knives causes all damage dealt to the target to become guaranteed critical hits for a short duration. With almost any build, especially those specced into bonuses with critical hits or status effects like the bleed Vex build , this short window is more than long enough to burst down any boss in the blink of an eye. Plus, you can also get the Damage Amp Payload effect, which—in the same vein as Penetrator—causes the target to simply take increased damage for a duration. In fact, you can even get these two bonuses together if you're lucky for guaranteed critical hits and a flat increase in damage…",

It turns out the seemingly perfect alternate dimension Peacemaker has been hanging around in is actually one where America lost to Hitler in World War 2. Essentially, he's accidentally found himself in Nazi utopia, exclusively populated by white people and where the American flag's stars have been exchanged for a swastika.

It's not like I've got anything against them, but seeing a Battlefield 6 trailer with guest stars didn't fit the vibe that I thought Battlefield Studios was going for with this latest game. One of the biggest fears many players have had throughout the lead-up to Battlefield 6 was that it would unceremoniously morph into Call of Duty at some point, be that by adding ridiculous skins or with weird collabs that are out of place in its gritty battleground.

Beginning with Universes Beyond, while it was already known that the current Spider-Man set would only be the first dip in the Marvel waters for Magic, we didn't know exactly what corner of the Marvel Universe we'd visit next. Now we do. June will bring a set called Marvel Super Heroes that features the Avengers and various Avenger-adjacent characters like the Fantastic Four, Squirrel Girl, the Heroes For Hire, and Wolverine, as well as villains like Killmonger, MODOK, and Loki. The next return is a less-expected one, with The Hobbit double-dipping on Middle-earth after the success of the Lord of the Rings expansion .

If my memory serves me right, it was around 11 years ago that we first entered the PC market with Yakuza 0,\" recalled Yokoyama. \"Until then, we had only released our games on PlayStation, and they were exclusively in Japanese, made specifically for the Japanese market. \"The Yakuza series itself was originally created with the concept of 'Japanese people making a game for Japanese people,' so we never imagined it would be accepted globally. But once we properly localized the language and created an environment where players around the world could enjoy it, the PC market embraced it in a big way. That acceptance helped our studio grow and pushed us toward globalization.\" Yakuza 0 on PC was certainly my introduction to the series, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio finally bridged that gap with some of its finest work.

At least, it's supposed to require the Clawline.

In an interview with GamesRadar , Forza Horizon 6 art director Don Arceta dove into how Playground Games prepared to recreate Japan and gave some hints about what players can expect from the biggest, densest game in the series yet. \"Working with Xbox Series X, we worked with that on Horizon 5, and we've really grown to understand that technology for Horizon 6,\" Arceta explained. He went on to add that, \"Technology and console aside, our workflows and the way we built our worlds throughout each iteration, for Forza Horizon 6 [we took] lots of learnings from past games.\" One of the \"past games\" that influenced Horizon 6 most was (somewhat surprisingly) the Hot Wheels DLC for Horizon 5, as Arceta explained: \"We actually developed a new way to create those orange tracks that go around the road to get the best quality and have it be authentic [to Hot Wheels]. We've actually leveraged and built off that tech to build elevated roads that weave and web around Tokyo City.\" Tokyo is just one part of the vast map f…",

Today's show was quite the change from our usual summer and Most Wanted broadcasts. The Tokyo Game Show has been going for almost 30 years, so we figured it was high time we got in on the action and highlighted some of the excellent games there. People at the show were lucky enough to get hands on with Farmbotic, a cozy farming sim with adorable robot companions. For those of us at home, the trailer in our Tokyo Direct still gives a good glimpse at what it's all about. For your viewing pleasure, we've got the zombie carnage of Killing Floor 3, the cartoonish and charmingly British Earth Must Die, and one of the coolest games we've ever seen, Denshattack, where you play as a train carriage that's also the best skateboarder in the world.

Junko is a \"hikikomori,\" someone who secludes themself at home, away from the outside world. Following a therapeutic program, Junko finds herself alone again, desperately trying to reconnect with two of the people she met during the process. One is Shinji, the protagonist of Don't Watch. The game is all first-person, and you'll venture throughout Juno's apartment and her own, crumbling psyche which is conjuring up liminal spaces and terrifying hallucinations.

Part of that I attribute to its original fantasy world where it feels like the devs, unshackled by the aesthetic constraints of a 20-year-old series, were able to make something far more grandiose than grimy streetfights. Who better, then, to bang out the soundtrack than Yuka Kitamura, mastermind behind the tunes of Elden Ring and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice? A studio recording was revealed during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, interspersed with some new clips of the game's combat. It's all snarling strings and portentous vocal melodies, and given that it's performed by a live orchestra, it's a level of production value the sidescrolling beat 'em up is treated to less often than I'd like.

The triple threat character setup means you can launch an enemy into the air with one character, switch to another, and send them crashing back down in a matter of seconds.

You play as a monk who can literally ride the wind, using the clouds as platforms to walk on or skimming across the water gracefully. Meeting a talking cat doesn't seem so farfetched now. We also see more of the poem-making in action. You'll get to craft haikus based on the environment around you. So, when you encounter the fisherman, you can try to cheer him up by choosing from a list of words you've gathered and making the best verse you can think of.
