Only one in 100 games featuring a cheater is an impressive stat, but such a claim also depends on Ricochet having 100% confidence that it's detecting all cheaters… which may not be the case. Secondly, a median time to detection of three matches seems… a little high?

      "body": "One of Phasmophobia' s greatest successes is its lasting effect on the horror genre. Multiplayer horror has always had a foothold amongst the subgenres' finest, but after Phasmo's release five years ago, the scene has totally exploded with more horror games, both intense single-player experiences and wacky multiplayer romps. Part of this was certainly thanks to other factors, such as the pandemic keeping people inside, meaning that many were looking for new ways to hang out with friends, but it's safe to say that Phasmo's success spurred on the appetite for co-op games we've seen recently, like Lethal Company or REPO . (Image credit: Kinetic Games) You'd think that Phasmo's creator, Daniel Knight, would want to keep some of that success to himself, but that's just not the case. \"There's definitely some games out there that have taken a lot of inspiration from Phasmo,\" Knight tells me. \"But the reason why I made the game was because nothing like it existed, and I wanted to play that game. So now that there are all these other games out there, the same as Phasmo, it's just really good to see.

If you can cast your mind back to the heady days of 2019, you might remember the game's initial announcement, when Paradox got Brian Mitsoda—writer on the original Bloodlines and narrative lead on HSL's Bloodlines 2—on stage to announce the series' revival with all manner of hullabaloo. The game was due out the following year. A year later and the game was not out, but Mitsoda and creative director Ka'ai Cluney were suddenly and shockingly fired. In 2021, Hardsuit lost the project entirely . In 2023, Paradox revealed it had given it over to The Chinese Room , which had dramatically overhauled the game in its own image. Today, we are six days away from that game's release, and hoi polloi like us still don't know any more about what went down with HSL's Bloodlines than we did several years ago. And it's likely to stay that way for some time. Maybe forever. The wounds still seem too fresh for anyone to go blabbing too much about it, but in a recent post on his blog Mitsoda shined at least a little light on where …",

Probably one of the closest updates for that is the player character coming out, basically reworking all the character models and all the animations.

But I do miss some of the bugs, like being able to hold doors shut to shield yourself from the angry ghost trying to catch you, or being able to climb onto the kitchen counters to hide from ghosts. But now Phasmo is going for more serious vibes, stripping all of the comedic bugs away.

Microsoft says that Copilot app update 1.25095.161 is already beginning to roll out across all Windows Insider channels, and that asking it to \"make my screen easier to read\" or \"help me focus by reducing distractions\" will cause it to guide users to the relevant Windows settings page, complete with a brief summation of how to make the changes they seek.

It's job is to help simplify, improve compatibility for, and increase the capabilities of x86. Now, exactly one year on, AMD and Intel are letting us know the fruits of this perhaps peculiar collaboration. Those fruits, outlined by AMD , read a little like elvish to my weary eyes, but the general gist seems to be that there have been four big improvements made, in the form of new standards for upcoming Intel and AMD chips. Those four areas are the development of Advanced Matrix Extension (ACE), AVX10, Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED), and ChkTag. The latter two should improve CPU interrupt security and performance as well as memory safety. The last point is particularly relevant because Arm already has memory tagging for memory safety, so ChkTag will be x86 catching up in this regard. AVX10 will be the latest iteration of x86's AVX SIMD instructions, which should improve vector performance. Then there's ACE, about which AMD says: \"Accepted and implemented across the stack, ACE standardizes matrix multiplication capabilities, enabling seaml…",

Battlefield 6 can be blindingly white at times, especially when looking/moving in or out of buildings. It's like my soldier's eyes are adjusting to the light in real time, but it instead causes my own retina to burn when viewing bright areas, or trick me into thinking I've gone blind when transitioning to dark areas. It's an issue almost everywhere, but it plagues maps like Operation Firestorm and Liberation Peak, where the contrast is even greater. Thankfully, I can put down my sunglasses, as there is actually a bandaid solution hidden in the game's menus. Simply head into the settings and look for the 'world brightness' option—you'll find it in the accessibility section when you first open settings, or at the top of the graphics tab.

      "body": "Ex-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger spoke to CNBC earlier this week, ruminating on a variety of topics, including AI. When asked whether he thought the tech industry was in the middle of an AI bubble, he responded: \"Of course. Of course we are. We're hyped, we're accelerating, we're putting enormous leverage into the system. \"That said, I don't see it ending for several years. I do think we have an industry shift to AI, as Jensen has talked about and I agree with this, businesses are yet to really start materially benefitting from it. We're displacing all of the internet and the service provider industries as we think about it today. We have a long way to go.\" Fears around AI being an economic bubble, like the one that caused the dot-com crash in 2000 or the global financial crisis in 2008 , appear to be at the front of many industry minds of late. OpenAI's Sam Altman recently commented that he thought \"someone [was] going to lose a phenomenal amount of money\" due to overinflated AI company valuations, mere weeks before announcing another megabucks deal with Broadcom—while Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan recently said that \"the level of uncertainty in most peoples' minds should be highe…",

Completing odd and often challenging tasks has always been one of the highlights of the series for me, but Battlefield 6's assignments are very grindy, and there are a good few that are very hard to complete by yourself. The biggest issue right now, however, is that it's a Sisyphean task: there's a prevalent bug preventing assignments tracking whatsoever for some players, or not tracking accurately in other cases. Healing 5,000 damage from teammates or getting kills while buffed by a stim is one thing, but when none of it is counted and you're not making any progress at all, it's a frustrating mess.

By designing its own chips and systems, OpenAI can embed what it’s learned from developing frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence,\" the announcement says. That implies OpenAI wants to at least try to do its own thing with AI hardware rather than be entirely at the mercy of Nvidia and, to a lesser extent, AMD. But arguably the bigger intrigue involves the financial implications of yet another big hardware deal from OpenAI. Lest you have forgotten, in recent weeks OpenAI has announced a $300 billion deal for cloud computing services with Oracle, a complex deal with Nvidia worth at least $100 billion , followed by yet another deal with Nvidia's arch rival, AMD, that's worth at minimum tens of billions of dollars .

But it's a cosy sort of amble, the kind a hobbit might take on the cobbled path to their humble hole, because let me tell you: I think this game is going to be very good. The demo, which you can play as part of Steam Next Fest, already promises a really endearing management sim. You hire staff, sell drinks, and get to enjoy some Discworld-esque story events, delivered to you by the game's charming narrator—all in a bid to fix up whatever tavern you're saddled with into a destination for adventurers and paupers alike.

Not only does it take ages to rank up your account, which you'll need to unlock most of the best guns , but you then need to level up those weapons to unlock attachments. And how can we forget the pile of extra assignments that you can complete for more guns, gadgets, and cosmetics? Some of these tasks simply take ages to do, whether the challenge is straightforward or not. Thankfully, there is another option—at least for now. By using the best BF6 XP farm , you can quickly earn ranks and weapon levels, and complete any assignment challenges you need to stay competitive. I'll just warn you, it's not fun. Best Battlefield 6 XP farm (Image credit: EA) The fastest way to earn XP in Battlefield 6 is easily bot matches using the Portal custom servers. On the main menu, scroll down to 'community' and then search for 'XP farm' in the 'search experiences' section. There'll be plenty of different player-made templates for you to pick from, but I recommend Rush or Breakthrough on hardcore mode because these funnel bots into smaller areas and you can kill them faster. You can also use XP boosts to speed up both your account and weapon progression.…",

For some, that's less of a phase and more of a lifestyle choice—and fair do's, I say. If that describes you, then I have something positively titillating for you: a fully ceramic keyboard from Keychron. It seems like it might be titillating for more than a few people, too, because the Q16 HE 8K Kickstarter project has raised a whopping 48x its Kickstarter goal, with $488,375 (£359,459) currently pledged. It seems a lot of people have their eyes fixed on that glossy look. If you've never graced your ears with the sound of ceramic keycaps before, then I suggest you do so . Keyboard sound profiles are subjective, of course, but I don't think anyone would deny there's at least something very distinctive about the ceramic sound. I don't doubt that will be amplified even more with the entire keyboard being ceramic rather than just the keycaps. Though I must say, after listening to some initial reviews (on the Kickstarter page), it strangely seems to sound a little less ceramic than some keyboards I've lis…",

Details on the lunge enchantment for the spear have been shared in an official blog post about the update. This enchantment gives you a burst of speed when using the weapon, which you can take advantage of in combat to deliver hits to any mobs that might be challenging to fight with a sword. But, you can also use the enchantment to travel around the overworld a lot faster, which is bound to save your hunger from rapidly depleting if you run around on foot. Other features available to test in this snapshot include the Nautilus, which you will now be able to go and tame and ride around the ocean, alongside the Zombie Nautilus which we now know is tameable.

      "body": "Blizzard recently opened the gates on a renewed version of an old World of Warcraft expansion, giving players the opportunity to blast through familiar quests and dungeons with way more power than they had back in 2016. For many players, WoW Legion Remix is an opportunity to collect achievements and cosmetics they previously missed—or the new ones Blizzard added on top. Many of them require completing raids and dungeons that take full groups, but finding parties has proven to be a problem in the early stage of the event. Weirdly enough, players are running into completely the opposite problem you'd expect if this was the regular version of WoW: Tanks, out of all three available roles, are the overwhelming majority. That's because, as you gain more and more gear upgrades, characters dedicated to healing or pure damage-dealing aren't really needed. Unfortunately, this leaves behind all the players who haven't had the time to grind themselves into godhood. Reddit user Fjoes posted a screenshot of several groups, made up purely of tanks, waiting for a healer or damage dealer to fill the empty slots. It's a full-on tank meta and the gap will probably get worse as the average power leve…",

It's something that leaves Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith \"eternally shocked,\" as he told FRVR : \"By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, ten. It’s like ‘what the hell is going on here?\" Speaking on the FRVR Podcast, Nesmith shared that Todd Howard would roll out the concurrent player numbers every now and again, to which Nesmith could only respond \"'You've got to be kidding me? Seriously, ten years later.'\" You'll never find a consensus on which Elder Scrolls game is the best—I go back and forth on it all the time, myself—but it's no secret which is the most popular and broadly accessible.

A peek at the top demos page on Steam reveals what has the most players interested from the jump. Right at the top is the Heroes of Might and Magic prequel, Olden Era , which has spent the last few days accruing a Mostly Positive user rating on the platform. Just below it is Half Sword , a bloody physics-based medieval combat simulator whose demo has already been popular for a while. The two could make for a nice double feature if you want to run the gamut from high fantasy to mundane, macabre reality. Runners up from there include voxel-based, ship-crewing survival game Everwind , an extraction shooter called The Cube, Save Us , and a silly multiplayer wizarding game about voice chat-powered spell incantations called Yapyap .

This is lore from the very first Fallout (not Fallout 2) that the design team \"knew was true… but nothing in the game directly stated it.\" Cain says these were ideas that were supported by narrative and environment design but never stated directly in the game. As Cain puts it: \"Nobody should be walking around the Wasteland going, 'Hey did you know they dropped nukes eighty years ago?' Yes! Everybody knows that!\" To be explicit, this is not canon. \"This is stuff that was true in the first game but there's no design document,\" says Cain. \"Bethesda is canon. You don't have to like it, but water's wet.\" The first biggie?

He goes on to explain upcoming changes to encounter and class design. \"If you're playing it out of the box, no addons whatsoever, and trying to play at the highest competitive levels, I do think that it is too hard,\" he says, \"and I think that consequently, hardly anyone is attempting to do that.\" Midnight aims to change that dynamic. Initially the team focused on trying to limit the impact of combat-related mods, but soon realized it wasn't feasible to carve away bits of their functions. But the idea of taking away mods and WeakAuras' ability to read combat information swiftly required tweaks to nearly every part of the game's group activities.

      "body": "It's fair to say that, as shooters go, Battlefield 6 has quite a fast time-to-kill, with the best guns , like the M4A1 and SGX , dropping you in a matter of seconds. However, high bloom (random bullet deviation causing shots to not land where you're actually aiming), especially on assault rifles (looking at you, M433 ), has resulted in the very strange situation where SMGs are actually more effective than ARs at medium range. One of the prime examples of this is the PW7A2 —one of my favourite weapons so far, thanks to incredible accuracy at range on top of already strong TTK and handling. Well, that's only the tip of the iceberg, as I've just got my hands on the SCW-10 SMG. You'll need to complete the Close Quarters 1 assignment to unlock the SCW-10, which requires you to get 300 close-quarter kills with SMGs and inflict 10,000 damage while aiming with SMGs. Thankfully, this isn't as bad as most other assignments. Now, I'll admit, the SCW-10 might be the worst-looking gun at first sight, owing in large part to its very small frame, low precision stat, and measly 15 bullets in a magazine. The thing is, these don't matter once you've actually seen the gun in action. Boasting higher …",

Imagine a typical MMO party—one healer, one tank, and some damage-dealers—and then give them names and characteristics that resemble MOBA heroes. That's Fellowship, a hero-based co-op RPG where parties of four clear through increasingly difficult dungeons and collect loot. Fellowship is the fun of grouping up with your buddies (or randos) and seeing if you can coordinate well enough to overcome bosses with room-filling attacks. There's nothing more thrilling than wearing down a big health bar and barely squeezing out a victory because everyone was able to maximize their role in the fight. And that's just the boss fights. There are tons of strategies for how to work through the packs of enemies efficiently that you'll need to adapt to as the challenge increases. After a handful of betas, Fellowship is launching in early access on Steam this week.

And holy hell, it appears to have worked. The AMD card was rigged with a series of electrical wires to bypass the missing VRMs, and was left riding piggyback aboard its much-more-powerful competitor.

George W Bush is president, and the subprime mortgage market can only go up, up, up, baby! Wait, no, sorry. It is in fact 2025, but all those things I said about Serious Sam 2 remain, inexplicably, true. To mark SS2's 20th anniversary, Croteam returned to the game to give the whole thing some new polish and \"keep those Serious vibes alive for years to come!\" The changes are many, but the biggest is that Croteam has packed the SS2 Renovation Mod right into the base game. That's \"a global cosmetic mod to ensure the most comfortable Serious Sam 2 experience possible\", that does things like rework the interface to be closer to the Serious Sam Xbox version, tweak weapon visuals, and make \"enemies gib in a much more satisfying way\". Which, thank god. The new update has also split the game's controller and KBAM control menus out into their own separate fiefs, separating the bindings entirely. HUD icons have been redrawn in HD, fonts are better, movies play in full screen, and the default res is now 720p. In essence, Serious Sam 2 is now rea…",

Developers either stumble and make a game that just seems too gimmicky to scare anyone, or they manage to hit the sweet spot and create something that's more than just terrifying—a horror game that'll stick with you. And from what I've seen so far, Eyes Out's latest game, Sleep Awake, does exactly that. My hands-on preview for Sleep Awake saw me enter the ever-shifting world of The Crush about midway through. The protagonist—Katja—had to make her way to a location, bypassing hordes of violent cultists to find the one person she cares about in this deteriorating world. (Image credit: Blumhouse Games) This was a stealth mission: Katja is navigating through broken apartments via rickety impromptu bridges, holes in walls, and decrepit elevators, all while making pit stops at almost every source of cover there is—that may just be my way of playing. The cultists don't have a particularly harsh line-of-sight—perhaps that's thanks to their ill-fitting gas masks—so if you're careful, keeping to the shadows and making use of all the cover there is, you can weave your way through them without many issues. But that doesn't me…",

But if you move a little off the beaten path, you'll find an absolutely superb board that ticks a bunch of boxes for gamers and typists alike. Enter the Lofree Flow 2 , which follows up on the original Flow. The latter stands as one of my favorite low-profile mechanical keyboards, so it's a tough act to follow. The Lofree Flow 2, however, has proved lightning can strike twice. One of the surprising aspects of the original Lofree Flow—considering how little-known the brand was at the time—was its undeniably high-quality construction. The good news is that you still get that premium feel and attention to detail in the Lofree Flow 2. If anything, it's been stepped up a notch. First, though, you'll need to choose from three size options: 100 keys (96%), 84 keys (75%), or 68 keys (65%). We reviewed the 84-key version, and it provides a comfortable balance of functionality and portability.
