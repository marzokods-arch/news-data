By provoking controversy, Horses has clearly done part of its job as a work of art, although after playing it, I was disappointed that it didn't fully take advantage of its potential as a game. It's visually strong and thematically coherent, and a fascinating attempt to explore topics and tones in games that have often been reserved for film, but it struggles to integrate the experience of the player in a way that doesn't distract from its point. The horses are people, if you hadn't noticed yet In Horses, you play a young man, Anselmo, who's sent to stay and work for two weeks on a farm. The farm is populated mainly by naked humans wearing horse masks. Bad things happen on the farm.

Stellar Blade was Shift Up's debut release on Steam, which naturally exposed it to a much wider Western audience. Of course it was a different sort of exposure that put Stellar Blade over the top with a certain portion of gamers, but beneath all the silly T&A was a reasonably solid action game that put up more than three million copies sold across PC and PS5 as of July 2025.

This insight was shared by Sapphire's Edward Crisler, its North America PR rep and PC gaming evangelist, on the latest edition of the Hardware Unboxed Podcast . Over the hour-long discussion, Crisler and HUB host Tim Schiesser chatted about all things gaming GPU-wise, from the RDNA 4 launch to the current RAM crisis, and even Nvidia's 12VHPWR meltygate power socket. While discussing VRAM and who gets to decide how much a card can have, Crisler said with a smile: \"I got to be careful of what I'm about to say here.

At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs.

If you're like me, you may have spent way too long looking for the staff locker room in the Departure Building, before realising it's tucked away in the almost separate southwestern area. You'll also have to find the underground tunnels in the Spaceport and then activate a terminal with the Flushing Terminal Key afterwards. I'll run through all the steps below. You can bring a free loadout to this if you want, considering even if you die and lose the key, you should be able to get it again since all the quest has to be completed in one round. Reach the southwest lobby of the Departure Building and find the staff locker room You'll want to enter through the south end of the Departure Building (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first step of this quest involves heading to the Departure Building just to the west of the Launch Towers in the centre of the map.

So when ZSA offered to send over its Voyager keyboard, along with its new Navigator trackball module, I had high expectations. Essentially, the Voyager is a pared-down Moonlander, with all excess fat trimmed away to leave as minimal a keyboard as possible. \"Laptop-friendly,\" says ZSA's marketing. \"Goes anywhere—on your desk or on the road.\" I certainly can't argue with that because with just 52 keys and a total thickness of just 16 mm (0.62 inches), the Voyager is as whisper-thin as you could want. However, both the thickness and key count result in some notable compromises. For example, there's no wireless connectivity option because batteries would add to the weight, cost, and size of the keyboard. With such few keys, you have to make full use of the Voyager's layer system to access standard options such as function keys. On the plus side, the ZSA Voyager comes with multiple USB cables of…",

Wonder no more: in a post-TGA interview with PC Gamer, Larian boss Swen Vincke confirmed that Divinity will be a turn-based RPG, and elaborated a bit on what we can expect from its combat and systems. \"It's not a clone of D:OS 2 in that sense, it's a new ruleset, a ruleset built on everything that we learned from all the previous games that we've done,\" said Vincke. \"I think you're gonna enjoy it. It's very easy to learn, very hard to master, but it allows you to do fantastic things, which is the most important bit. \"It's going to give you a really good time figuring things out, and how you can chain things to one another and come up with all kinds of shenanigans.\" When asked whether Divinity would be turn-based and have a similar party size to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke responded in the affirmative. Baldur's Gate 3, as well as both Original Sin games, allow four characters in your active party at any time. So while Vincke didn't provide the exact number, four seems like a sure bet.

Amazon should know this well, having turned a bunch of The Rings of Power's second season into a weird rehash of Star Wars with Tom Bombadil as Yoda. And though I didn't hate the second season of The Witcher, it was a shame to lose the twisty structure of the first season's jumbled timeline, which relied on viewers spotting details to untangle which events took place when, and not gain anything nearly as thinky to replace it. So I went into Fallout Season 2 with concerns. For starters, I expected the pre-war flashbacks to become vestigial, hurried past to get on with the modern day story of Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Praise be to the Atom then, that the flashbacks remain central. Barb continues making moral compromises on behalf of her family and Coop keeps finding out about corporate shenanigans that force him to become involved. But usually the reason TV shows disappoint in their second season is, while the first season can focus on introducing the core cast, the second needs to broaden things to keep generating new story.

Larian knows that's what people now expect from its RPGs, and it's already bringing actors into the studio to work on Divinity . \"We're still casting, but we already have a bunch of actors in,\" studio founder Swen Vincke told PC Gamer in an interview after The Game Awards , where Divinity was revealed. Unlike a film that's written first and then shot, Larian's creative process entails capturing its actors' performances as soon as development is out of pre-production. \"This gives you an idea of the ambition,\" he said. \"We built a huge studio in Guilford, with six recording studios in there. The idea is that these are going to be recording nonstop on this game, which gives you an idea of the ambition. It's big, because we want you to have lots and lots and lots of choice.

Rather than try to shoehorn our favourite games into a handful of fixed categories, we ask each member of the team to nominate up to six games released this year. Then we tally up the votes, hop into a big, global call, and argue over which games are worthy of an award—as well as picking our Game of the Year itself. Once the games are chosen, we assign award categories based on what quality we think that game specifically excels at. That's why there's a different selection of categories each year. And what a year it's been—full of surprises, some disappointments, and a handful of games that dominated the conversation throughout.

Jason Chen told Commercial Times that once upon a time, memory only accounted for between 8% and 10% of the cost of a PC's Bill of Materials (or BOM). Between Q3 and mid-Q4 of 2025, memory prices rose anywhere between 30% and 50%, in turn seeing the overall BOM jump by between 2% to 3%.

Speaking to PCGamesN , the voice actor for Baldur's Gate 3's Astarion, Neil Newbon (who knows a little bit about voice acting because he's won friggin awards for it ), was very down on AI voiceover, echoing statements both he and his fellow BG3 cast members have made before on the subject: \"Comparatively speaking, the amount of money it costs to do those voice lines compared to the rest of the game's development is peanuts. When a game's successful, I don't really get why [developers] don't go 'well, at the time we couldn't afford to do it—it was too much or too difficult—but now we've been super successful, why don't we go back and actually redo the lines with actors?' That's an option; I'm just saying.\" It's hard not to empathise with Newbon, here. The rational, sensible grown adult in me whole-heartedly agrees with him—compared to other development costs, hiring someone to go into a booth for a couple hours is …",

This time, you're revisiting the same location and the same barrel, but there are a few additional steps that might trip you up. Considering the last thing you want to be doing is searching the swamp while there are other potentially loot-hungry Raiders on the prowl, here's what you need to do. I'd recommend foregoing a free loadout for this one, since a key you might need later drops at the end, and as we know with the Armored Transports quest, losing keys required for missions is a pain. Return to the water intake below the Water Treatment Control building You visited this barrel previously during the Source of Contamination quest (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first step in this quest is pretty simple—you have to head back to the drain just outside and to the north of the Water Treatment Control building.

In a recent blog post , Anthropic explains that as few as \"250 malicious documents can produce a 'backdoor' vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume.\" These findings arose from a joint study between Anthropic, the Alan Turing Institute, and the UK AI Security Institute. It was previously thought that bad actors would need to control a much more significant percentage of any LLM's training data to influence its behaviour, but these recent findings suggest it's actually much easier than that. According to Anthropic, \"Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents.\" For those a little lost, 'poisoning' an AI can take a few different forms. For instance, earlier this year YouTube creator f4mi became so fed up with her work being fed into AI models via her video subtitles, she 'poisoned' this data by inserting gibberish text only the AI could see .

And no, for all you pedants out there: That's not just the number of players who've touched Silksong with a Game Pass subscription. \"Millions more\" have played on Xbox Game Pass, according to Team Cherry, which dropped the numbers while revealing that a free Silksong expansion is in the works for next year . \"It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected,\" Team Cherry said in the blog linked above. \"Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home.

We also asked Sammelin if there's any truth to the theories that Embark matches players partially based on their \"niceness.\" In the example our interviewer gave, it would make sense for Embark to match players who clearly preferred pacifist runs with like-minded raiders, especially in solo Q. Sammelin was cagey about the details, but did confirm that player behavior is a factor in matchmaking. Sammelin: \"Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We do analyze behavior and match accordingly.\" PCG: \"But you can't say anymore?\" …",

This season of the show has opted for the setting of New Vegas, and PCG's Ted Litchfield recently had the opportunity to speak to the lead writer of Fallout: New Vegas, John Gonzalez. As well as some inconveniently correct observations on the lack of credit and residuals for videogame writers , Gonzalez was in a reflective mood on how some aspects of the 2010 game come across in 2025. This includes one of New Vegas' most memorable characters, Mr. House, a tech tycoon kept alive by a supercomputer who runs the post-nuke Vegas, and who'll have a major role in season 2 of the show. \"My own sense of Mr. House has changed as we've seen the rise of Silicon Valley would-be messiahs,\" says Gonzalez. \"One of the things that now seems prescient is the fixation, the fascination they have with technological immortality. \"But Mr. House is unique in that he was able to calculate when the Great War was going to occur within a window of a few days⁠—he was just a couple of days short of getting the platinum chip. I don't think we're seeing that Elon Musk is able to calculate things to that degree of p…",
