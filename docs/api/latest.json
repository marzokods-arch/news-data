Now, another challenger has, er, entered the half-pipe (I apologise to all skaters). Skate Style is a new game about risking shredded knees for the thrill of mild propulsion that leans closer to the Session end of the authenticity scale. Developer Zellah Games bills it as a \"next-gen skateboarding game\" focussed on realism and physics-powered tricks. What separates Skate Style from other games of its ilk is its extensive customisation. Not only can you customise the look of your skater and board, but Skate Style also comes bundled with an in-game animation editor. This allows players to adjust numerous variables like body movement, foot placement, and timing. This combines with a physics-based trick system where your character's feet can actually catch the board. As for where you'll be skating, Zellah Games highlights two maps …",

It's gone down a storm with Terraria' community, but there is one aspect to the update that players will have to wait a little longer for—mod compatibility. This is because Terraria's mod support relies heavily on tModLoader , an open-source addon that facilitates both creating and playing mods. It's an enormously popular tool, with a user-base that rivals some of the biggest games. But as with many mod projects, the 1.4.5 update has produced compatibility issues that will take some time to fix. This was explained by tModLoader's creators in a Steam post . \"We know everyone is looking forward to tModLoader and mods having access to all of the new content and features as well,\" the modders wrote earlier this week. \"We'd like to remind users that updating tModLoader to major Terraria releases is a huge undertaking.\" For context, the modders pointed out that it took nine months to update tModLo…",

Now though, as the developer gnaws through the last few items on its to-do list, it has formally revealed when the game will depart early access, and it's happening in March. Announcing the date in a Steam post , Mechanistry also showed off the game's intro cinematic, which it has temporarily redubbed as a \"lore trailer\". I query this title, not only because lore isn't generally foregrounded in this manner, but also because the arc of the trailer is \"some beavers cross a desert and then start building a city,\" which is not exactly deep worldbuilding. It is a nicely animated video, though, with some supremely gravelly narration from British actor Shaun Dooley. As Mechanistry notes in the post, Timberborn has come a long way since its debut into early access in 2021. Previous updates have introduced water pumps , robotic beavers and hazardous polluted water , alongside whole new transportation methods such as ziplines and water tubes.

Features a new ending for the expansion (optional).\" As shown by YouTube's exhaustive Witcher 3 documenter xLetalis in the video above, this plotline helps explain why Shani returns in the Hearts of Stone expansion. At one point in development her life would have been at stake if you crossed the expansion's villain Gaunter O'Dimm. The restored scenes use dialogue found in the game files, which suggests this plotline was cut quite late in development, but everything else has been made from scratch.

I was going to dive deeply into the Oedipal aspect and definitely keep it hard R with the Little Sisters, and the 'choices' the protagonist makes… and the consequences,\" Verbinski recalled in his comment. \"I had worked out a way with writer John Logan to have both endings and I was looking fo…",

There, he laid eyes on Wolfenstein 3D , a moment that changed his life forever. \"It was just such a generational leap from anything I think I've seen up to that point,\" he says. \"My brain just did not comprehend what it was saying. It was violent and it was 3D and it looked exactly like real life.\" Today, Marshall is the director of Size Five Games, a British indie studio that has developed games like the point 'n' click throwback Time Gentlemen, Please! the procedurally generated heist sim The Swindle , and the hybrid platformer and adventure game Lair of the Clockwork God . Size Five's latest game is Earth Must Die , a stylish comedy adventure in which you play an alien dictator hellbent on destroying Earth. \"I think comedy is better when there's a serious heart to it.

It's become a bit of a running joke in the Final Fantasy 14 community that the MMO will never get Blitzball, with the game's director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) playfully scolding players during Dawntrail's pre-release when talking about Gold Saucer updates. Well, jokes on him, because Blitzball's actually alive and well in FF14. I have been to a match (big up the Buccaneers), cheered in a crowd, and even gotten myself a special novelty hat, all without a single lick of game code actually dedicated to it. The Etheirys Blitzball League (also known as the EBL) is a roleplay community that hosts and runs in-game tournaments of the fantasy sport.

But I'm not here to talk about Mario. I'm here to talk about Yoshi. Yoshi, Baby Mario's foster father and adult Mario's horse, is the headlining new character in the Super Mario Galaxy movie, which appears to be a neverending tapestry of references for theater-attending videogame players to point at and whisper, \"I remember that guy\" to their spouses and/or parents. The new teaser Illumination put out yesterday is packed with visuals and characters from Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart, Mario Sunshine, and the titular Galaxy. What's notable about this teaser is that Yoshi does that thing that he does. He gobbles up Kamek the Magikoopa in slow-motion with a flick of his tongue and then poops him out, his glasses comically intact over the fresh egg.

It's an idle clicker rather than a 3D physics puzzler, and the relationship it depicts between humans and geese is far less antagonistic than in House House's game.

I decided to mark it with a quiz. But which quiz? We've had BG3 quizzes before, and the game is so dog-eared from repeat playthroughs by fans that it's difficult to come up with something truly challenging. Then it hit me: gnomes. Gnomes are great; they're literally just weird little guys, and BG3's gnome characters are some of its finest. So here it is: the definitive, be-all and end-all quiz about the gnomes of Baldur's Gate 3. Warning: it's actually quite hard.",

Well, it achieved the seemingly impossible, improving upon X-COM: Enemy Unknown . Firaxis' refinement of Julian Gollop's groundbreaking original seemed like a perfect distillation, retaining the essence of what made Gollop's game great—the tension, the heartbreak, that feeling of squaring off against overwhelming odds—while also ironing out many of the kinks present in that original design. But then along came XCOM 2. Firaxis' sequel upped the ante from defending Earth from alien invasion to liberating it from alien occupation, recasting your organisation as a scrappy guerilla unit fighting a totalitarian regime from within. It introduced stealth to missions, letting you get the drop on xeno soldiers, and transformed your base into a flying fortress that could travel across the geoscape. It al…",

When you move out, though, all bets are off, and you can tell everyone who lives nearby exactly how you feel. And I've never seen a moving out message sent quite so spectacularly as by Rust player and reddit user UniverseBear, who constructed a giant, illuminated middle finger to say sayonara to his server buddies. As seen in UniverseBear's reddit post , the flashing flip-off is emblazoned on the side of a rectangular tower built from corrugated iron and concrete. The offending gesture itself is constructed from industrial lights timed to cycle through an animation where the middle finger slowly raises from a clenched fist. It seems this is something of a tradition for UniverseBear, a way to cap off a round of Rust when the server is due to be wiped. \"Making one of these is often how I like to end a successful wipe,\" he wrote, before detailing how exactl…",

Sci-fi Shooters 2.0 is a two-tiered bundle, and there's good reasons to shoot for either of them. Paying the minimum price of $14 (£12.51) will net you four games, namely Doom Eternal . Prey: Digital Deluxe Edition , Black Mesa , and FPS roguelite Battle Shapers . I'm not hugely familiar with Battle Shapers, but the other three games are, in my opinion, must-play experiences. Doom Eternal is still the best single-player FPS you can play today, a spellbinding iteration of id Software's 2016 Doom reboot that rewards mastery of its rich combat system in a manner unlike anything I've played before or since. Even last year's Doom: The Dark Ages , which I enjoyed very much, cannot compete with the ferocious pace and intensity of Eternal's combat. Then there's Prey, which isn't really a shooter even if it technically qualifies as one. It is, however, a…",

In The Outer Worlds 2, which I finally got around to playing this week after hearing great things , I don't feel like a real person while moving around. I feel like a camera, perfectly hovering in place and magically stabilized as I plop one foot in front of the other. It's as if Adam Jensen installed gimbals in his eyeballs. I'm talking about headbob : the subtle camera movement of first-person games that mimics the body's natural bob as it walks or runs. Headbob is so established and omnipresent in first-person games that it's rare we have an occasion to acknowledge it. When headbob comes up, it's usually because a game has too much of it. The Outer Worlds 2 has no headbob. Zero , unless you're sprinting. Your neck is totally detached from the motion of your body, and it's driving me up the wall. It's distracting, ugly, and comes off as a totally unforced error. I didn't realize just how necessary head jostling is to beli…",

Anthropic's adverts criticise ads being introduced to ChatGPT, and describe it as a \"betrayal\" of users. I regret to inform you all that the irony metre has officially smashed. It has gone off the scale. First thing to say is, the ads are also good: I'd recommend watching one or two first, while thinking about OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's face the first time he saw them. To take one example, embedded above, an AI user asks a bot (a middle-aged woman, in the ad) how to communicate better with his mother. When he asks what to do if the advice doesn't work out, the \"AI\" recommends a site for dating mature women where \"cubs\" can find \"cougars.\" Each ad ends with the same sting: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\" As if it couldn't get better, this is backed by the refrain from Dr Dre's What's the Difference, which goes \"What's the difference between me and you?\" Look, I know it's marketing, I know they've \"won\" by ge…",

People will glom onto anything and everything that seems to be even tangentially related to Half-Life 3, and the latest rumour doing the rounds was no exception. The Valve fan account GabeFollower posted a new YouTube video claiming that this time it was actually, definitely happening, including a claim that the project is so done-and-dusted that Valve had begun moving its devs onto other projects. So far, so Sunday morning, though for whatever reason this claim was picked up and reported on by several outlets. Now: any games developer reading the above is probably laughing themselves silly.

Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back.

There are actually two types of yokai—Nurikabe and Mujina—that you can ward off using emotes. So here's what you need to do. How to emote in Nioh 3 (Image credit: Team Ninja) You can emote in Nioh 3 by pressing the right bumper and the start button on controller, or 'G' on keyboard. This will open the gesture window where you can pick from a bunch of different gestures (there are multiple pages, so no doubt an emote for every mood). Select your emote, and your character will bust a move. If you're wondering why the emotes are colour-coded, that'll come in handy for dealing with Nurikabe yokai. How to use emotes on Nurikabe and Mujina in Nioh 3 (Image credit: Team Ninja) There are two types of yokai that you can deal with peacefully by using emotes, and those are the Nurikabe and Mujina. Nurikabe are yokai pretending to be walls , often guarding tr…",

Here are six games to play while maintaining your luck for the year. Balatro (Image credit: LocalThunk) Entering a new year, everyone has their list of most hotly anticipated games (here's ours ), but Balatro is the perfect example of a Cinderella story that comes out of nowhere. A single developer tinkering around, trying to learn how to build a game, resulted in a smash hit that won Best Indie Game and was nominated for Ultimate Game of the Year in 2024's Golden Joystick Awards . This roguelike deckbuilder tasks you with racking up absurdly high point totals by whatever means necessary, whether that's filling your hand with multiples of the same card or using special math powers conferred on you by your collection of Jokers. As we said in our review , \"This is an absolute triumph.\" If you haven't tried it out, you owe it to yourself. No game nails \"num…",

Imagine my disappointment. And now, as of the most recent Steam beta update, there's even less Linux weirdness to deal with when you slip free of the shackles of Windows. As of yesterday's Steam (and Steam Deck) client beta update , Valve has put paid to a bug that meant the platform would sometimes forget it can run Windows games on Linux. Cut it some slack; it's 23 years old. The bug in question afflicted users with especially large libraries—though Valve doesn't say how large—and would \"result in Proton games showing up as 'Not valid on current platform'\".

The big tentpole additions are a new raid quickplay option and a major wardrobe update, the latter introducing a fashion template system that, on paper, lets players quickly and easily change their looks. This is the first major update of the Visions of Eternity expansion cycle, one that—in a tweak to how previous annual expansions worked—features very little in the way of new stuff . Due to complaints around how limited the updates were in previous expansions, ArenaNet is saving new maps and story chapters to the second and third major updates.
