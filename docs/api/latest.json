Light of Motiram store pages have been taken down, and Sony and Tencent have each agreed to cover their own legal fees. “SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,\" Tencent Americas head of communication Sean Durkin confirmed in a statement provided to PC Gamer. \"SIE and Tencent look forward to working together in the future.” Light of Motiram's more-than-passing similarity to Sony's Horizon games, Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, were immediately apparent when the game was revealed in 2024 .

Maybe that's the best compromise: Blueprints have felt pretty stingy in Arc Raiders since launch. I've played for nearly 50 hours and haven't managed to find more than seven—to be fair, I'm not looking all that hard, but it's strange that other rare loot (like fancy guns and gadgets) are significantly easier to find than the blueprint for items that aren't even that good, like muzzle brakes. That was probably the aim of raising drop rates in the first place, though Embark never actually confirmed it raised them in the first place until today's hotfix. My only regret is that I didn't jump back in while the loot was overgenerous. Oh well, at least I'm more likely to find the number one blueprint on my wishli…",

The Goblin King quests are some of the more annoying tasks, and it's not enough to just complete one for his highness and move on. There are five Goblin King quests in The Forge, each a little more difficult (and expensive) to complete than the last. It's a nice bit of XP, but the biggest incentive for appeasing the Roblox royalty is access to a new location—the same one you need for another sidequest, Find Tomo's Lost Cat. Some of the Goblin King's asks get awfully tedious, so I suggest redeeming active The Forge codes to help you prepare with a few extra spins or free luck totems. How to complete every Goblin King quest in The Forge (Image credit: FireAtacck / Roblox) You'll have to bring the Goblin King money and an array of rare ore in all five of The Forge's sidequests. He's more bridge troll than anything, really, and demands more valuables with every visit.

So this just made perfect sense for the region that we'd be expanding into, and the reasons why the region is that way. It really fit well with what we had.\" (Image credit: Bethesda) This new area of the Wasteland is indeed inspired by the sandy slopes of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 , with the pillars being \"desert, deathclaws, and raiders\" , which also coincidentally ties in with Fallout season 2 on Prime. \"We set this up in a way so this new area goes along with the show a little bit,\" LaCoste says. \"We just wanted to expand in a different direction, you know.

According to a report from Rest of World , the optimal temperature range for a data centre lies between 18 °C and 27 °C (or 64.4 °F and 80.6 °F). However, of the 8,808 data centres in operation, 7,000 have been built in places that typically experience a climate outside of this range. Furthermore, 600 (or about 10% of all data centres) have been built in places that regularly breach that temperate 27 °C ceiling (via Tom's Hardware ). Data centres are already power hungry, collectively hoovering up 1.5% of the world's total electricity consumption (or 415 terawatt hours) in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency .

Locations over loquaciousness. Its best stories are typically buried under five feet of rubble, and dug out with archeological care through terminals and holotapes. Nonetheless, over almost three decades of irradiated exploration, some standout missions have emerged. Most are potent displays of the genre's potential for reactivity—tales which allow for creative approaches, and multiple outcomes you'd never uncover without a spot of wiki-diving. Others are memorable simply because they're odd: creepy, daft or moving, written in a distinct tone that stands out against the green-grey backdrop of wasteland America. Either way, they stick in the head like a Bing Crosby number played on a tinny radio.

Both of those chips get the big Panther Lake CPU die, making for a total of four Performance, eight Efficient, and four low-power Efficient CPU cores.

Turns out that this was a minor miscalculation on developer Embark's part, but only a minor one: the developer has now issued a hotfix that sees the blueprint drop rates \"slightly lowered\" though they remain \"higher overall than before.\" Now a further Christmas gift has been issued to all raiders. Log in to Arc today and you'll find Scrappy, the most demanding chicken in the world, serving up a cool 1,000 raider tokens for free. That's an amount that would normally cost you around $10 and, what's arguably more important, enough to buy a shiny new skin for your raider (or a hat for Scrappy). The gift is a tiny bit buried-away. You'll need to check your mail in-game, which is an icon in the top right of the inventory screen, and then open the email titled \"Happy Holidays!\" from the developers. Then you're all set. Oh, one more thing.

So much so that we never really give them much attention: We just download the patch and carry on as normal. However, Asus has warned that many of its Intel motherboards are vulnerable and can allow access to system memory, which is enough to make anyone sit up and pay attention. Asus does point out on its security advisory page that although the problem is widespread and has a CVE rating of 7 (High severity), the vulnerability does require local access to the motherboard in order to gain access to the system RAM. The problem relates to the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) and add-on PCIe devices. The former has all kinds of protection mechanisms for direct memory access (DMA) operations, but Asus doesn't fully activate them on its Intel motherboards until just before the operating system is able to take over DMA protection duties. In other words, between first booting up the motherboard and the OS managing DMA operations, there's a window of opportunity for someone to use a PCIe device to gain access to system memory. That's obviously not a good thing, hence Asu…",

Parent company Monotype Imaging, which bought Fontworks back in 2023, then introduced a new pricing structure costing easily fifty times as much as the old plan (via Automaton ). US-owned Monotype's pricing structure initially offered no local pricing for Japan, but still expected devs to cough up $20,500 per year, in addition to agreeing to a ridiculous 25,000-user cap on games using the licensed fonts. Thankfully, the parent company has backpedalled a bit since, allowing developers to extend their licenses under the old affordable plan for the time being.

Sounds spicy. Before you envision yourself building new bases at far flung locations, the new maps are not \"anywhere near the size of like the Hagga Basin,\" Bylos said. \"They're smaller one-kilometer-by-one-kilometer maps in size, and they contain very specific activities.\" Building bases isn't one of those activities, but players will be able to complete \"combat missions, sabotage missions, crafting missions, harvesting missions, and exploration missions,\" said Bylos. \"And you choose one of those five mission types from the Landsraad board, and then you go to whichever map it points you to on the Overland.\" This folds into a new Landsraad specialization system included in the update, where players can earn XP in those differ…",

It rules. The third-stage Guild Navigator is the best and weirdest part of a very good and very weird movie. And yet, Denis Villeneuve has now made two Dune movies, and we still haven't seen his version of the third-stage Guild Navigator. Since Dune: Awakening is based on Villeneuve's Dune movies, we haven't seen a third-stage Guild Navigator in the game, either.

Even the title is a calligram: the umlauted O is our hero—the umlaut represents their ears—while the lowercase os are the bombs they carry around. In this puzzle metroidvania, the hero (let's just call them Ö from now on) can't really do much except explode those bombs. There is no jumping, no mantling, no attacking, no nothing, unless it can be achieved via the detonation of a bomb. When Ö starts with one bomb things seem simple enough: to jump, I spawn a bomb beneath myself and detonate. If I place a bomb and stand to the left of it before detonating, I'll be propelled leftward, which can be useful to clear a pit. Eventually Ö gets a second bomb, which offers a little more manoeuvrability while further complicating the puzzles. All this points to a clever but by no means revelatory puzzle game.

In particular, a scene where a child was depicted riding on the back of one of the farm's captives , the horse-headed captive being naked. This was later changed before the release of the full game.

While that does make the i600 a less compact gaming PC than the first iteration, it is a far more effective device because of it. And it's still pretty small if you compare it to most RTX 5080-based gaming PCs on the market. You can, of course, build out a small form factor mini-ITX machine in something like the Fractal Design Terra and have yourself a powerful micro machine, but it's not going to be able to get close to matching the cooling and aural design of the Corsair One. This thing is pacey, and this thing does it all with an understated grace you'll struggle to match with any compact DIY build. The key to that is the dual 240 mm AIO water cooling loops the Corsair One employs to keep its CPU and GPU components chill.

The publisher has become one of the most prolific—certainly within strategy and management games—with its recent releases including 9 Kings, Cataclismo, Endless Legend 2 and Manor Lords. It's also got good instincts: a significant number of its published games have gone on to be critical and commercial successes. Bender says that as he's scrolling through Steam, \"everything is designed to help me discover games\". I can find it hard to sift through the vast number of games released every month, but to be honest I can't fault the Discovery system: it's always spitting out stuff that's in my wheelhouse. And, to be fair, a lot that isn't. Instead, there's a problem with expectations, he reckons. \"Some people complain about the number of games released or wish for some kind of guaranteed exposure, but store platforms should welcome all entrants and let player preferences guide visibility.

I can't imagine playing Diablo 4 without sanctification, a new crafting system that is technically exclusive to the season but shouldn't be because it's almost perfect. It is responsible for dramatically improving the core loop of the game in ways I wasn't really expecting after playing with an unfinished version on the test server a few months ago. Sanctification is essentially a way to gamble with items for a chance at extraordinary outcomes. You take a piece of gear to a special forge and roll the dice to see what new bonuses are added to them. And those bonuses aren't always some extra strength or maximum life; they can add effects from the best items in the game. A forgettable pair of gloves can become the most powerful gloves you've ever worn, if you're lucky enough. This means every piece of loot is an opportunity for something amazing.

Justin Theroux, who plays Robert House (one of the apparently two Robert Houses that have appeared in the show so far) may have just tipped us off to an exciting upcoming Fallout: New Vegas cameo. The revelation took place on the \"Fake Fallout Talkshow,\" which you'll find hidden on Prime TV's Fallout show page on the \"Extras\" tab. It's a short talk show—a fake one—hosted by comedian and actor Jon Daly as his \"Snake Oil Salesman\" character, the shady vagabond best known for having sex with chickens and giving Thaddeus the elixir that ghoulified him. There's some real Between Two Ferns energy to the fake show, with the Snake Oil Salesman asking inappropriate or insulting questions: in one episode, he asks Ella Purnell how much money she makes, and repeatedly badgers her about what it's like being on Stranger Things, a show she does not appear on.

It's gonna be an interesting one. It means that most likely, we already need to do a lot of optimization work in early access that we didn't necessarily want to do at that point in time.\" …",

Why? Crandall, who has worked at Kingston for 29 years, says the company is experiencing NAND wafer price spikes the likes of which have never been seen before. In conversation with Mark Hachman on The Full Nerd Network podcast , Crandall got specific, saying there's been \"a 246% increase in NAND pricing as compared to Q1 of 2025.\" He later goes on to elaborate, \"We just recently saw a 70% increase in NAND costs over… I think it was a 60-day period. So, that 250% I mentioned earlier—70% of that was increased within the last 60 days.\" As NAND flash chips make up about 90% of a single SSD's Bill of Materials cost, that's an especially eye-watering uptick for both businesses and general consumers alike. As such, Crandall offers a word of advice to anyone considering upgrading their rig's storage: \"Do it now and [don't] wait, because prices are going to continue to go up.\" In other words, we've yet to see just how high SSD prices can go.

However, while it is all RAM-related, it's not necessarily bad tidings. The claim in question was posted on the Chinese Board Channels forum (via Benchlife and Overclock3D ) and basically claims that Nvidia is set to reduce the supply of its gaming GPUs by between 30% and 40% in the first half of 2026, compared to the volume of output during the same period in 2025. That's not surprising given that the DRAM supply problems, affecting the entire computing industry, will result in fewer desktop and laptop PCs being shipped next year. Given just how many of them typically sport an Nvidia discrete GPU, either soldered onto the motherboard or in the form of a third-party graphics card, the demand for RTX Blackwell chips is obviously going to plummet. However, there's not exactly a huge shortage of GeForce RTX 50-series cards at the moment, with the exception of sensibly priced RTX 5080 and 5090 models.…",
