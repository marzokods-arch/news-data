A new report says that three of the biggest players in NAND chips, the flash memory that goes into PC SSDs, are all planning on doubling their prices. Digitimes claims that Samsung is planning on more than doubling the price of its NAND chips in the first quarter of this year, \"amid tightening supply and surging demand driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence applications.\" The site further says that, \"SK Hynix has implemented NAND price increases of a similar magnitude, while Sandisk has previously been reported to be planning a 100% NAND price hike in 2026.\" That means three of the biggest players in NAND chips for SSDs all plan to double their prices, or thereabouts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Digitimes also notes that Samsung recently reported very strong financial results, with revenues up by over 22% to roughly $65 billion for the final quarter of 2025. Samsung's profits for the same period doubled to a little under $14 billion. As they say, nice work if you can get it. Many SSDs are already almost triple the price…",

Remember Reigns ? Nerial's game of Tinder-esque swipe-based monarchical decisionmaking was massive in 2016, followed by a sequel called Reigns: Her Majesty and spin-offs in other settings. Reigns: Game of Thrones seemed like a particularly perfect fit with its stories of bastardry and beheadings.

Rather than reliving the short-lived reigns of cursed royals, each run is one of Dandelion's ballads about Geralt's adventures.

(Image credit: Embark Studios) This is a big change from the usual augment, as until now, you couldn't carry any guns in your safe pockets. The only way you could stop other raiders from getting their grubby little hands on your precious Osprey or Venator was by disassembling them as quickly as possible before you got downed. While this new augment may not be entirely useful in the PvP lobbies, where most players actually give each other great guns instead of taking them away.

It's not just the fact that, as a generally not small woman, my feet don't touch the ground while sitting in this gaming chair, but also the fact I'm perched atop a 5000 mAh lithium ion battery. Yes, this is a $699 / £580 gaming chair offering an array of features that require a considerable amount of juice. But before we get into all of that, let us ask the most basic question: What is it like as a regular ol' gaming chair? Well, as previously mentioned, the first thing to get out of the way is that this is not really made for me; the XL or Plus edition of the DXRacer Martian Series is intended for folks up to 180 cm tall, and is designed to support a weight of up to 125 kg. But even adjusted to my preferred tilt angle and the lowest possible chair height, my feet don't touch the floor, swinging in the air like a tiny tyrant.

      "body": "Word reached me this morning that hot new PvP raid shooter Highguard has an unusual bug. According to Steam user Captain_SmellyRat (excellent), the game's resolution is tied to its post processing setting, which means lowering it drops the output resolution in turn—despite reporting otherwise in the settings menu. Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%. Turn post processing to High, and the game runs at full 4K. I tried a few different resolutions to see if the effect scaled down the stack, and yep, post processing Low seems to force the game to run at 80% of its stated resol…",

The main issue is that A Prime Specimen seems to be bugged right now, though I'll explain that below. The first step of A Prime Specimen is to obtain two Arc Powercells. These are the common Arc material used to craft shield charges, so you'll likely already have a stockpile that you can bring into a raid (that's what I did). Otherwise, you can find them on any Arc machine. So, grab two Arc Powercells and head into Blue Gate to find an Arc Deforester.

Since that time, Valve has actually announced its very own Steam Controller . Yet TommyB says \"that doesn't change anything\" and his controller looks better than ever. It's called the OpenSplitDeck. The new version looks as chunky, if not chunkier, than the one we saw back in June last year. Though it has been massively overhauled since then with a heap of new upgrades and quality-of-life improvements. It now supports gyro controls, much like the Steam Controller, with one gyroscope in each half of the controller. Gyro functionality is, creator TommyB says, \"a little noisy\" at the moment, but he's looking into ways to improve this and use the dual-gyroscopes to better effect in-game. Each half of the controller also features a slim screen down the inside edge. One of the larger overhauls here is a shift away from Arduino to the Nordic nRF Connect SDK.

Nvidia previously announced a new Arm processor called Vera and based on custom-designed CPU cores. Now the company has announced an initial customer for the chip and emphasised that it is the first time it has supplied a CPU as a separate product. Bloomberg reports on a new deal between Nvidia and cloud services outfit CoreWeave that forms the basis of what is effectively the launch of the Vera CPU. In what has become a typically circular form for the AI industry of late, Nvidia is investing $2 billion in Coreweave, while the latter will buy up to $6 billion in Nvidia hardware, including those Vera chips. Bloomberg says the Vera CPU will be competing with server chips from Intel and AMD, along with other cloud computing processors such as Amazon's Graviton.

Apparently, doing it for the second Expedition and the Snap and Salvage quest wasn't enough; once again, you'll have to hop into Stella Montis and hope that you spawn close enough to grab the materials you need before they've been looted by everyone else. This time you'll need a Rotary Encoder and an Ion Sputter , and will also have to complete some additional steps in Stella Montis itself. With further adieu, here's how to complete With a View, plus both items you need. Where to find a Rotary Encoder in Arc Raiders You can find a Rotary Encoder in Medical or Assembly—I found mine in a drawer in the former (Image credit: Embark Studios) Since the Rotary Encoder is an Exodus material, you can find it in Assembly, Medical, or in the security office in the Lobby in Stella Montis. I personally found mine in a drawer on the upper floor of the Medical area. As with finding any exodus material in Stella Montis, the key is spawning close to the areas and then effectively rushing them before all the containers have been looted—it's not ideal, but this will keep happening so long as qu…",

For one, he wasn't actually meant to sit on the throne—until he orchestrated the death of his very large brothers. Also: he's an idiot, a coward, and his sole advisor (and friend) is a tiny floating robot full of milk whose sole purpose is to nurse babies. Her name is Milky. He's really the last person you want running the show when your home's being invaded by a bunch of weirdos from a very silly planet known as Earth.

They went on to explain that they were an avid modder, digging into the guts of games like Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire to tweak the progression curves of player stats⁠—which is about as granular a difficulty modifier as you can get. They further asked for Sawyer's thoughts on the cost/benefit analysis of letting players get so far into the weeds \"officially,\" or at least baking in the modding freedom to do so. \"If it cost nothing⁠—which it does not⁠—then I would say let players in-game set their difficulty options however they like,\" said Sawyer. \"And when it comes to exposing data tables and letting players mod that stuff, let 'em do whatever the heck they want.\" The nature of this question has changed over the course of h…",

It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map. This phase plays out like an accelerated battle royale match—rushing to find better guns and armor, but usually not immediately fighting…",

Progression is still a little stagnant for now as Hytale chips away at early access updates, though the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers is more of what I want to see, even if it feels a little underwhelming. With the fancy book, you can summon undead hordes to smack enemies about and take the pressure off yourself. Well, I say horde, but you've got a limited amount of pages to work with. At full capacity, it's more like a small skeletal squad. You can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians. They aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire only seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments.

In a 76-page lawsuit filed in the US District Court of Rhode Island last week (via GoLocalProv ), a group of investors allege that Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks, former Wizards of the Coast president Cynthia Williams, and company executives engaged in \"breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors and/or officers of Hasbro\" by devaluing the Magic brand, even as shareholders raised concerns about the ramifications of overprinting cards and sets. In 2022, the lawsuit says, Bank of America issued a report concluding that Hasbro was \"overproducing Magic cards, which have propped up Hasbro’s recent results but are destroying the long-term value of the brand.\" Despite questioning from shareholders and analysts, however, the lawsuit alleges that the defendants \"repeatedly denied such speculation,\" issuing \"materially false and misleading\" statements during shareholder calls where those concerns were raised. As a result, the p…",

FromSoft dusted off the venerable swordsman to serve as a boss in Elden Ring Nightreign's recent Deathly Forsaken Hollows DLC. He's effectively been \"ported\" to Elden Ring's iteration of the FromSoft game engine, allowing Elden Ring Fights to pit him against the Lands Between's finest. And boy, for a battered veteran coming out of retirement, Artorias fares better than all those tomato cans they kept setting up in front of Jake Paul. Artorias went on an absolutely brutal tear through the bosses of Elden Ring: Early terrors like Margit and Godfrey don't stand a chance, with single hits from Abyss Artie chunking their health bars.

And as any farmer's almanac will tell you, the end of winter always brings two things: Asymmetrical combat engagements and an overabundance of avian activity. Truly, the cycle of the seasons is a beautiful thing. (Image credit: Embark Studios) In a news post , Embark offered some details about what to expect when the Headwinds update arrives on January 27. The most impactful addition is a new matchmaking option that'll be available for experienced raiders who've reached level 40: Solo vs Squads, offering bonus XP rewards for lone wolves who're willing to risk a fight with a full pack. Whether or not additional XP is enough of a draw to actually get anyone to choose the new matchmaking option is another question. I'm doubtful—and personally speaking, as someone who's thoroughly on the friendlier end of the aggression-based matchmaking spectrum, you'll find me anywhere else. But if the …",

Sure, it's capable of delivering gaming laptop-like performance, but compare it to any discrete mobile GPU of the current generation and the little graphics tile's limits are quickly revealed. Now, none of this is meant to cast shade upon the considerable achievement of Intel's engineers. No one was expecting its new mobile graphics hardware to compete with, say, anything from the RTX 50-series. In fact, Intel claims the Core Ultra X9 388H is 10% faster at gaming (on average) than a lappy with an RTX 4050 mobile.

And then, well, it was back to silence. That may be because Clockwork Revolution is the studio's \"most ambitious title, probably by a factor of 10,\" InXile head Brian Fargo said in a new interview with GamesRadar , and that sort of ambition takes time. Clockwork Revolution is InXile's first big-budget first-person RPG, and Fargo said the studio aims to \"bring the level of reactivity from our isometric titles into something first-person,\" which as a fan of the Wasteland games I'm happy to hear. Morality may also follow a twisting path based on the choices you'll make in the game, which will allow you to be the bad guy and maybe even make it worth your while. \"Here's what's really important to us: if you don't allow the player to be bad, to really go down those rabbit holes and see the consequences play out, then they never had free will to be good in the first place. They're not choosing to be good, they're just being forced down a path,\" Fargo said. \"We think it's essential that players are making that choice, not having it made…",

That's primarily because it was too expensive for what it offers, especially compared to the first version. So consider me downright stupefied that Logitech seems to have raised its price, at least in the US. When I reviewed it, it was going for $100. Now it's going for $120 . To be fair, this is what happened with the original PowerPlay: it started off at $100 and was later raised to $120. But to be equally fair, I don't care, it's still far too expensive considering the downgrade from the first one. In case you don't have a clue what I'm on about, the G PowerPlay pads charge your compatible Logitech mouse—provided it has the charging puck in its underside—simply by resting the mouse on top of it. This means you never have to plug it in to charge ever again. The problem with the second version, though, is it cut back a lot of what made the first so good. In particular, the first one came with two pad toppers rather than one—one hard, one soft. And in even more particular, with the original you just had to plug in the pad in and it would not only charge your mouse but also act as the hub…",

Such was my attitude when I fired up Reentry – A Space Flight Simulator —a videogame you know is good because it kicks off with archival audio of John F Kennedy—but it was an attitude I was quickly disabused of. Reentry is, more or less, a flight sim, insofar as belting yourself into a missile is a kind of flight. It's one of those grognardy flight sims, too. No arcade-y get-up-and-go here; your craft's panels vibrate with twiddly switches and inscrutable gauges. Successful flight, when you come to it, relies on you completing an exhaustive series of checklists: does the radio work? Does the radio work at ultra-high frequency? Does it work at low-power ultra-high frequency? Does it work at high frequency (non-ultra edition)? Repeat this for every big, bright button on your board.

Instead, it's primarily been found in weird hybrid tablets , ridiculously expensive handhelds , and a select few similarly expensive workstation laptops . It looks like that might soon change, though. Lenovo has been cooking up some new gaming laptops, some of which it showed off for CES 2026 (including one with a rollable screen ), and it's just hinted that a Strix Halo laptop might be in the works. Specifically, a 'Lenovo Legion 7 15ASH11', which was for a while listed as a supported model for its Legion Space software (via VideoCardz ). This is the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 10, featuring an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and Nvidia RTX 5080 mobile. (Image credit: Future) Note the 'ASH' there, which presumably stands for 'AMD Strix Halo.'

Intel remains tight-lipped regarding handheld implementations of its impressive new chips, with the only word I've heard on the matter being something shown to the public \"soon\". So, I'm left with little but speculation for now. Still, we can have fun dreaming together, can't we? Handheld gaming PCs are currently in a bit of a weird space, as far as I'm concerned. Sure, there are plenty to choose from, but it's quite telling that the Steam Deck still crops up with regularity as one of the top recommendations. Its APU is really starting to show its age in 2026, and while it still makes a fantastic value proposition, I'd primarily recommend it as an indie gaming machine if you're looking for smooth performance.

You're possibly going to be disappointed, then, to know that you're almost certainly not going to see any such lappies coming to market. The reason why is quite simple: it all comes down to the number of available PCIe lanes in the platform controller tile. Intel has two variants of this chiplet: one with 12 lanes (four are Gen 5, eight are Gen 4) and the other with 20 lanes (eight Gen 4, twelve Gen 5). The important thing, though, is that every Core Ultra 300-series processor that has the big 12-core Xe3 iGPU uses the 12-lane platform controller tile. AMD and Nvidia's mobile GPUs are designed to use at least eight PCIe lanes. That doesn't mean you can't fit a discrete GPU alongside a 12-lane PTL chip; it's just that it will leave just four for everything else inside the laptop. The majority of NVMe SSDs require fou…",
