It's made a pretty penny already, enough to fund two years of further development, and crucially, it's actually good . PC Gamer senior editor Christopher Livingston said in his impressions that the game \"has a long road ahead\" but \"what's here and working works well.\" The Hytale Team seems keen to keep the momentum up, as just four days after release, players have already been treated to a sizable update . It kicks off with a patch note containing the two most beautiful words in the English language: \"added dinosaurs.\" It's a good sign that the team has its priorities straight. But that's not all. There are some new character creation options, a slew of bug fixes including several crash fixes, and some balance changes addressing some fundamental-sounding problems: \"weapon attacks should now check for line of sight,\" for example. Some placeholder assets and animations have been traded for more polished ones, and \"cautious wildlife predators\" have been adjusted so that they don't attack you unless you give them a reason to. You can find the full patch notes…",

Serious enough to pull a gun in the middle of a store, apparently, as NBC reported happening during a robbery in Manhattan on January 14. No one was hurt, fortunately, but the trio of robbers brandished handguns and smashed open several display cases full of merchandise at the Poké Court on 13th Street. They stole what store owner Courtney Chin estimates is $100,000 in merchandise. The thieves remain at large. Now, I know what you're thinking. This crime, though unfortunate, is sort of novel and maybe even a little funny because a Pokémon store was robbed and not a bank or an art museum. That's why you're reading it on PC Gamer, after all. Typically, the only heists we cover involve Payday 3 or the latest crypto nonsense ⁠—who the heck steals Pokémon merch at gunpoint? But a brief trip down the rabbit hole informed me that this Pokéheist is embarrassingly mundane. Earlier this month , a similar robbery in Los Angeles involving the creature collector netted some armed thieves triple the payday of the above case. The same weekend, another ro…",

It seems to be paying off, as developer Moon Studios announced Thursday that the game has moved one million copies on Steam in early access, though it is about to share at least one thing in common with Diablo: 4-player co-op . The co-op announcement comes with a lavish trailer showing the feature off, and states it will launch Jan. 22. I haven't tried the game myself yet in solo play or otherwise, but seeing a gaggle of heroes take on a huge boss together certainly makes it pop. The game's model for co-op, which was detailed in a lengthy explainer video from Moon Studios in Dec. 2025, is \"similar to how realms work in Minecraft, the only difference being you don't have to pay for a subscription.\" What that means is that rather than Dark Souls invasions, Diablo 4's quasi-MMO open world, or other ARPGs' multiplayer systems where a single player's save file is used, No Rest for the Wicked will distinguish between persistent multiplayer saves and offline single-player saves.

MMORPGs are monstrously complicated things—they run on huge, easily DDOSable servers, they have economies that can easily get knocked off the rails, are designed to run for decades, and require constant balancing and fine-tuning. If you work on an MMO, you are Sisyphus trying to get a boulder up a hill, except you also have a bunch of angry forum users calling you an idiot the whole way up. Part of my job is understanding these complicated machines, and as I look at games in 2026, I'm starting to notice a trend that's really come to a head in these past few years: The main existential threat to MMORPGs of the modern era is getting the dang difficulty right.

That was announced in a press release Thursday and reflects a continued partnership between Netflix and Sony Pictures Entertainment, the latter of which will distribute the film. It's part of a \"landmark global Pay-1 licensing deal\"—the Pay-1 window being the bit of a movie's rollout right after its theatrical run and home video release—which the release calls an \"industry first.\" The deal includes streaming rights to a host of Sony Pictures films, set to \"roll out gradually starting later this year as individual territory rights become available, with full global availability on Netflix in early 2029,\" the release states.

People still speculate on a possible XCOM 3 daily online, and the flood of imitators has only gotten bigger the longer the series has remained dormant. Personally I think I'll be waiting with baited breath all year to find out when I can get my hands on cheekily named spiritual successor Star Wars Zero Company .

Both games are pretty good sneak-a-thons, worthy of respect simply for how seriously they take stealth. While Styx can technically fight enemies face to face, he is utterly terrible at it and will almost certainly get killed. Hence, evasion, trickery, and shanking guards in the back are the best ways to progress.

The sequel, Brigador Killers, has been in development for ages, which surprised me as I assumed it was just Brigador on a larger scale. But Stellar Jockeys recently released some new footage of the game, which shows it is a very different affair from the original, almost like a mix of Syndicate and OG Grand Theft Auto. As it turns out, that isn't far off Stellar Jockeys' own summary of the experience, with the dev having previously described it as \"Hitman: Contracts meets GTA2\". The main difference is that Brigador was a dedicated mech shooter, whereas Brigador Killers lets players explore missions on foot.

Perhaps that's why I'm excited for the latest comedy adventure of the same name from Size Five Games, which has just announced that it'll let you embark on a mission of planetary destruction later this month. Earth Must Die wraps you in the silken robe of VValek Lizardtongue, a megalomaniacal alien nepo baby who has just inherited the kingdom of Tyrythia from his father. Unfortunately, he's instantly lost control of his realm due to the invasion of robotic Terranoids that killed his father in the first instance. Naturally, Vvalek decides to take his frustration out on Earth, for reasons we'll presumably discover while playing. Like Size Five's previous game Lair of the Clockwork God , Earth Must Die is inspired primarily by the comedy point 'n' click adventure games of the '90s. But it boasts a much more modern animation style and an absolutely stellar voice cast that includes major video game voice actors and some serious British comedy talent. Said cast includes (but is not limited to) Final Fantasy 16 lead Ben …",

Yet like any properly edited work of fiction, there were originally a lot more words in CD Projekt's brilliant RPG. Hundreds of cut voice lines lurk within The Witcher 3's game files, ranging from simple one-liners to dialogue choices and even entire cutscenes. Under the forensic eye of PC gaming's modding community, however, nothing remains hidden for long. Over the last few years, The Witcher 3 mega-mod Brothers in Arms has restored hundreds of these cut lines (alongside other features like missing NPCs, restored books and journal entries). Brothers in Arms has been regularly updated since its release in 2021, with a new update reinstating even more missing dialogue from CD Projekt's cutting-room floor. These newly restored lines and cutscenes were highlighted by YouTuber xLetalis . The most notable is a new romance scene between Geralt and Yennefer that occurs during the quest The Last Wish. It revolves around a dialogue choice for Geralt where he chooses whether to say \"I love you\" to Yennefer. In the original version, if he chooses not to sa…",

Forbidden Solitaire wastes no time before getting weird. I was only a few minutes into playing the demo when I was offered some upgrades by an eyeball in a wall. It followed my cursor around as I hovered over gems that I thought would be slotted into rings on the giant hand in the middle of the screen. But when I bought one, my character jammed it right into his flesh. Forbidden Solitaire is solitaire if you could cheat by shoving gems into your hand because an eyeball told you to. My first upgrade let me undo my last move, which ended up being pivotal when I fought the fleshy mass of human skulls later on.

Or if you used Claude to generate a few code snippets? Or if someone in marketing used ChatGPT to make a spreadsheet?\" It seems that Valve has also been contemplating these questions and has made a tweak to its AI disclosure form for developers. In its submission form, Valve now specifies that game publishers must disclose pre-made generative AI assets only when used in marketing materials or content that \"ships with your game, and is consumed by players.\" That's via a screenshot of the form shared by Simon Carless' GameDiscoverCo. In other words, Steam's disclosure requirement is not concerned with generative AI tools used behind the scenes for efficiency gains (presumably including coding helpers) or office work, but with things like final art, sound, and writin…",

Currently, I think it's more leaning into the aspect of social facilitation in that sense of our design.\" Technically, it's possible to make money in Arc Raiders as a trader right now, but it's a slow, manual process to group up with customers, load into a match, drop items or blueprints on the ground, and sell those items later. An auction house would cut out the in-person interactions, but Watkins reckons that would undermine Arc Raiders' intentional emphasis on finding items yourself. \"We put a lot of very, very deliberate effort into making the game about the items,\" Watkins said. \"We previously explored and even partially built a trading system like [an auction house].

The tech in question is Google's Fast Pair system, which allows compatible devices to connect super quickly (i.e. one tap and you're done). As reported by Wired , researchers at KU Leuven University in Belgium analysed a range of different audio devices and discovered that the Bluetooth protocols used were vulnerable to being remotely hacked. Rather than just your phone being hooked up to your spangly new headphones, somebody else could join the connection, entirely undetected. Once in, they could do something as innocent as change volume levels or, far more worryingly, listen to what the microphones are picking up. Worse still, if the device supports Google's Find Hub tracking network feature, the location could be monitored.

If you just want to know the nine kinds of quest, then here they are: murder, kill, the infamous fetch quest, collect, delivery, the often maligned escort quest, talk, puzzle, and timed. Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains. We all know what a fetch quest is—go here, get this item. A collect quest is different in the same way a kill quest is—gather a set amount of an item, like 20 nirnroot. A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person. An escort quest is similar, only you need to deliver a person instead of an item, so they're often trickier. All of The Last of Us can be considered one long escort quest. One that sounds obviou…",

PLC or Penta-Level Cell flash chips aren't a new thing, as Intel, Toshiba, and SK Hynix all started working on their development a little over six years ago. Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable. Flash memory cells work by using a large voltage to effectively ram electric charge across an insulated gap. Once there, it can remain stored for very long periods of time before requiring a top-up. Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information. That only requires the voltage sensors with the flash chips to read one voltage, which is very quick and simple to do. However, because it's …",

Or, for $50 more, you can buy the Sony Inzone H9 II. Having seen the $350 price tag before receiving my review sample, I braced myself for the arrival of some really high-end audio gear. I thought of the Maxwell's aluminum and steel chassis, the space-age drivers, and the feeling that your money had gone on something boutique. I anticipated the delivery with relish. You can imagine my surprise when what I pulled from the box looked… fairly ordinary. Dull, even. More than that, the weight threw me for a loop the second I wrenched the set from its cardboard insert. The Inzone H9 II feels astonishingly light. Almost to the point of suspicion, if I'm honest. I'm used to ultralight gaming mice for premium prices, but light-as-a-feather wireless gaming headsets? Initially, it feels a little flimsy. Hollow, even. Then there's the headband. It doesn't look (nor feel) like the sort of plush skull-rester you might expect for this sort of cash. It's essentially…",

However, the meteoric rise in the demand for AI chips, backed by hundreds of billions of dollars, would appear to have pushed Apple aside in favour of Nvidia, according to a new report. This is what is being claimed by Tim Culpan , a technology reporter based in Taiwan. With years of experience at Bloomberg behind him, he is as good a source as you're going to get, unless any of the aforementioned parties decide to spill the beans directly. It certainly makes sense, though, because while the phone market is dominated by Apple , and is currently enjoying a marked rise in market share, the number of wafers it requires from TSMC will surely be less than what Nvidia is asking for. You only have to compare the physical size of their chips to realise this. Apple's latest A19 processor, as used in the iPhone 17, is manufactured via TSMC's N3P process node. It has a die area of around 100 square millimetres, which means a standard 300 mm wafer can yield many hundreds of dies. At the moment, Nvidia uses TSMC's N4 node for its current produc…",

As I use Notepad daily, I was already aware of the new additions, but it's thanks to Windows Latest that I know everyone using Windows 11 should see them, too. Well, perhaps not the AI text streaming, because that's apparently still only for Copilot+ PCs (ones with a CPU that has a 40+ TOPS NPU in them), though Microsoft says it will eventually roll it out to all Windows 11 systems. The table function is blessedly simple in form and function, and if you're already familiar with tables in Microsoft Word, you'll have no problems using this one. You start by clicking on the icon in the menu bar, then dragging out the initial table you want to use.

Magical Truck Adventure is classic Sega arcade stuff: bright and bubbly and immediately throwing all sorts of stuff at the screen within seconds. You take control of one of two kids operating an old-fashioned train handcar, chasing down a pair of crooks who've stolen your magical jewel and decided to flee by rail, making them incredibly easy to catch. At least if you're in good shape: the physical arcade machine requires you to constantly pump the handcar's lever to maintain speed, while a pair of pedals allow you to lean left or right off the rails and jump over the barrels and other random obstacles they hurl your way.

Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth contained within itself a whole Pokémon subsystem and Animal Crossing-style island building as mere side activities; why shouldn't Dark Ties tempt you to spend 20 hours doing runs to level up sidekicks, unlock new weapons, and earn stat-boosting gear like you would in any other roguelite? That's the gist of Hell's Arena, a new underground fight club hiding down a Kamurochō back street in the expansion starring Yakuza 3 villain (antihero?) Yosh…",

Kennedy will co-star with newcomer Grace, and their sequences will be roughly even in length, with game director Koshi Nakanishi describing Requiem as essentially two games in one. Grace's parts will resemble Resident Evil 2 and 7, and will be \"really entrenched in the horror aspects of the gameplay\". In other words, expect to do a lot of creeping around in the shadows, a lot of urgent crafting in corners, and every bullet expended will count. Leon's parts will predictably channel the \"thrilling tension\" of Resident Evil 4, as well as its action focus. If you've ever wanted to deliver a roundhouse kick to a shambling zombie nurse, have I got good news for you. \"Each part is ordered to offer the ultimate balance of tension and release,\" Nakanishi explained. It's an interesting approach to blend the two primary Resi gameplay styles together, and this hybrid presentation was settled on when the team realised they couldn't have it both ways with just Leon. \"We actually tried to make a genuine horror game with Leon,\" Nakanishi say…",

If you like metroidvanias I'm begging you to play it . 2021 was a huge year for metroidvanias—think Axiom Verge 2, Ender Lilies—but this was better than all of them. The creators of that underrated gem, LABS Works, has been working on Lovish ever since, which was originally meant to release this time last year. It's not a metroidvania this time, but rather a single-screen platformer mixing simple Astalon-style combat with puzzles. I played the demo last year and goddamn does this game feel good . While the puzzles generally boil down to \"grab key, reach exit\", the final game promises over 50 levels, so who knows where the team will take it. At the end of every level there's a randomized \"event scene\" pulled from \"hundreds of outcomes\", which include interactions with a huge cast of characters, as well as loot and/or boss battles.

Or maybe those will just be modifiers applied to existing maps, but Watkins' main point is that Embark isn't interested in adding maps just to have new places to do the same old thing. \"The ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot avai…",

Until now: JRPG studio Compile Hearts, best known for the Neptunia series, has revealed Okada is working on a new \"school life RPG\" alongside fellow Atlus veterans. And in case the significance of Okada's input was unclear to you, Compile Hearts has you covered: they describe the game as “Okada’s ultimate message to those who will lead the next generation”. Compile Heart launched a teaser website today featuring an oblique, sci-fi trailer loosely reminiscent of the Megami Tensei universe, albeit with a slight horror bent. A name wasn't revealed nor a release window, but Compile Hearts has promised a proper reveal on January 29. Okada is joined by writer Tadashi Satomi, who is credited as a scenario writer for Persona 2 and Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga and its sequel, among others. Aside from Megami Tensei, he's also responsible for writing The Caligula Effect series, as well as Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising. The composer for Digi…",
