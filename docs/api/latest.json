      "body": "AMD's Strix Halo chip, otherwise known as the Ryzen AI Max , has always been technically interesting. But it hasn't really added up for gaming. Until, perhaps, now. It seems the variant we always wanted to see, which majors in graphics rather than CPU grunt, is set to be released. Chinese PC specialist SixUnited has a couple of new Ryzen AI Max models listed on its website (via Videocardz ), and indeed, a SixUnited tablet running one of the \"new\" APUs has popped up in the PassMark database . The most exciting model is the Ryzen AI Max+ 388. That combines eight CPU cores with the maximum 40 graphics compute unit count available from Strix Halo. Currently, the only way to get a version of Strix Halo with all 40 RDNA 3.5c CUs is to go with the very top Ryzen AI Max+ 395 model. That's a very expensive APU and comes with fully 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, which is arguably overkill for mobile gaming, especially within the confines of a handheld. In practice, Strix Halo has therefore thus far been of more interest as a tool for running local AI models on a limited budget than for gaming. But what if there was a cheaper model that kept the 40 graphics CUs and 256-bit memory bus, but cut the CPU d…",

The complaints are multitudinous, but the general opinion is that, despite the delay, Football Manager 26 was not ready for release. \"The game just isn't finished. There's still over 13k bugs on the forums,\" writes user Ally . \"The polish the game has for a full priced release is an absolute scandal, misaligned text, inconsistent UI design, buttons not working, freezing, poor optimisation.\" User Saruwatari concurs . \"From the most basic functionality to the actual match engine, there's not a single area of this game that is not ridden with bugs.\" Beyond the game's technical problems, the UI is by far the most cited issue, with players bemoaning how fiddlier it is than previous iterations. \"You have to click a lot more to get the …",

It's China's latest bid to break away from US-made tech, and follows news back in August that data centre operators were being instructed to source at least 50% of their chips from domestic manufacturers . Now, data centres that are less than 30% complete are being instructed to remove already installed chips if they're foreign-made. One facility in a northwestern province that planned to deploy Nvidia chips has allegedly already been suspended before even breaking ground as a result of the latest guidance. However, it's being decided on a case-by-case basis whether data centre projects at a more advanced stage can keep their foreign-made chips. Reuters' sources say it's not yet clear if this guidance will be a nationwide decree, or only apply to certain provinces. It's also not yet c…",

Ever-smaller transistors and ever-larger chips have made this possible, but with the physical limits of both impacting the growth of computing, new methods are required to continue the growth. One semiconductor research team claims to have achieved just that by stacking not chips or dies, but individual transistors. The work by the team at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia was published in Nature Electronics (via El País ), and as is always the case for such academic research, it's all very complicated. Basically, though, it comes down to the idea that chip makers are looking to go up , rather than using smaller transistors or wider dies, to keep Moore's 'law' alive. Processors such as AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilise hybrid bonding techniques to stack dies on top of each other, to increase the number of transistors in the whole package, so there's more cache. All SSDs today rely on multi-layer NAND flash memory to improve capacity, performance, and reliability. However, none of these methods f…",

The publisher wants the ageing sequel to continue as the primary platform for virtual soap operas for the foreseeable future, rather than replace it and its many expansions with a full-on sequel. But the bugs piling higher than a locust swarm in a grain silo threatened to undermine the game's foundations. The first batch of bugfixes landed with immediate effect, addressing issues like deformed pets and vanishing ghost children. Slightly later than planned, the second QoL patch has now arrived, fixing more than 150 problems raised by the community on the EA forums and social media. As with any systems-heavy game, The Sims 4's complex web of interactions often produces patch notes that read more like a comedy script than an actual changelog, and this latest update includes some classics of the genre. For example, EA has tweaked \"relationship decay\" on couples who have a baby because it was \"too fast and destroying relationships\" (which frankly sounds realistic to me) while Sims have also been instructed to put items lik…",

Now, Bethesda would like you to know it's gearing up to break your mods once more, but at least it's a limited subset of them this time. With Fallout 4's 10th-anniversary edition gearing up for launch in the next week, the studio's warned players that it's going to break any main menu mods they might have come November 10, presumably because Todd Howard just gets a sick thrill from it. Or, well, possibly also because FO4's anniversary version will entail changes to the game's main menu, and so mods based on futzing about with the original version of that main menu will encounter stuff they don't anticipate in the new version and spark out like a robot fed a logic problem. Which is, you gotta admit, fair enough. I'd imagine the tweaks to the main menu relate to the \"new in-game Creations menu\" that Bethesda is adding to FO4, but that's not all that's coming.

Remember, these numbers are for the third quarter of 2025, alone. But from a PC Gaming perspective, the really good news is that the figures weren't all about selling AI chips to the likes of OpenAI. Sure, AMD's data centre revenue was up 22% year-over-year to a record $4.3 billion, making it the largest single contributor. But combined client and gaming revenue increased even more, up 73% year-over-year to $4 billion.

      "body": "Final Fantasy 14 's G'raha Tia is the sexiest man. Also, in unrelated news, his English voice actor Jonathan Bailey has been named the sexiest man alive by People Magazine . You might be shocked as I was ( appalled as I was, mortified as I was) to discover that People Magazine, a publication for normal, well-adjusted readers, made no mention of the fact that Jonathan Bailey has voiced a catboy in a videogame since 2017. It mostly focuses on what he likes to do on a day off, what he'd tell his 15-year-old self, and how a perfect date night for the man would go. Where's my G'raha lore, People? For shame. Anyway—it's really nice to see Bailey continue to meet with success. He was getting work beforehand, mind, but his international stardom's grown exponentially since 2020. Which I have to admit is probably due to him starring in Bridgerton and not because he voiced my favourite scion. He also starred in 2024's Wicked movie, which is based on a musical you might've heard of. I'm confident his new appellation won't go to his head, though. One of the things I like about Bailey, aside from his performance, is that he doesn't regard his work as G'raha with any less importance than his sta…",

But although the newest crossover, a Dragon Ball Z collab, isn't as pink and cutesy, I don't doubt a huge number of players will be thrilled to step into the shoes of Goku. As announced in a post on the official Minecraft blog , the Dragon Ball Z DLC features a \"hard-hitting adventure that will test your mettle, allow you to strike down villains, and see if you can go over mine-thousand.\" So rather than just adding a set of skins and some new NPCs to the survival mode of Minecraft, it will add an entire arena for you to fight against the series' most popular characters and change the entire survival crafting experience we're used to into a fast-paced fighting game. Each of the roster's 11 characters come with unique abilities to use in battle as well, which will unlock as you defeat each one. However, it's not all about fighting. The DLC also adds arenas for you to explore which have been recreated…",

In order to even get the drive up into their home rack, Plummer ordered a hydraulic scissor lift. \"You don't so much install one of these as you do birth it like an ocean liner\". To get the drive operational with his choice of OS (Unix), Plummer did a low-level format to handle future data, partitioned the disk into different regions for storage, and then created file systems on those partitions.

Having spent enough time with the console to create an alarmingly accurate mould of the DualSense controller with nothing but my palm prints, I think I'm qualified in saying this: the PS5 is a bit chunky, innit? YouTube maker channel Not From Concentrate apparently shares this sentiment, having shrunk the standard, bulky console into a comparatively svelte 6-litre chassis (via Videocardz ). While the base version of the PlayStation 5 is a comparatively chunkier 10.4 litres, the slim—with the detachable disc drive that looks kinda like a zit to me—is only about 7 and a half litres. So, yes, you do lose those eye-catchingly swoopey white wings but you do gain back a whole lot of space around your TV. This isn't Not From Concentrate's first attempt at a tiny PS5 build , but this latest project features support for full size M.2 form factor SSDs, and enjoys a much bigger potential storage capacity for all of your games as a result.

Its next season will make sweeping changes to how monsters fight back and how players customize their gear, and there's even more reworks coming in its next expansion. A big question that has come up as the game transforms yet again, is how often this is going to happen, and if it will continue for the foreseeable future. Speaking in an interview with Diablo streamer Raxxanterax , associate game director Zaven Haroutunian touched on this concern. \"The intention is not to replace everything just because we can,\" he said. Instead, the team tries to get a \"holistic picture of the whole game,\" and look at \"what is not pulling its weight, what is not helping support the player experience in a positive way.\" Haroutunian says monster types were one of the things that went untouched since the game launched and that they needed to be redone before a dungeon with leaderboards could be added. The Tower dungeon coming in the next season relies on the new monster types to gauge your completion progress, encouraging you to seek out tougher enemies for more points—something that just wouldn't work wit…",

Blueprints are one of the rarest drops in Arc Raiders , as they unlock the ability to craft weapons permanently instead of waiting for them to show up in the shop. The Anvil is a great blueprint to secure early on thanks to the gun's high damage and its Arc armor-penetrating heavy ammo. It's like carrying a pocket Ferro that you don't have to reload after every shot. Because blueprint spawns are somewhat random, there's no surefire place to get an Anvil blueprint. There are, however, raider containers that have a high chance of containing weapon blueprints. Thanks to the investigative work of the community, these caches can be tracked down with consistency. Where I found the Anvil blueprint I found the Anvil blueprint in a convenient hidey hole on Dam Battlegrounds that seems to always spawn raider containers. The raider cache spawns in a gap under where the raised highway on Dam Battlegrounds ends. The spot is between Raider Outpost East and East Broken Bridge.

No amount of editorials about why Telltale mattered could bring those games back. Which is why it's a pleasant surprise to see that Dispatch has done so well. Its developer, Adhoc Studio, just posted that it's sold over a million copies in 10 days , and it's not even done yet, with the final two episodes of its six-episode run due out on Wednesday at 9 am PST.

What's maddening is that New World itself was not a failure. It was a beneficiary of the early pandemic boom in online gaming, hitting a wild Steam concurrents peak of 913,634 after it launched in 2021. The MMO settled into much lower numbers by early 2022, but was far from a flop, and got an expansion in 2023 and a console port in 2024.

That's the overarching vibe, at least. But there are other things Arc Raiders makes abundantly clear. For instance: the Leaper. Embark Studios could have named this four-legged, spidery walking robot, one of the first truly serious threats you'll encounter on the surface, anything. Marauder. Devastator. Wriggler. Chuckles. I assume the studio went with Leaper because it did not need to get fancy to make these particular robots seem imposing.

S. Anderson since the late 2000s when he'd become a fan of the series.

Demonstrating his utter wrongness yet again is the Emulated Vintage Gaming YouTube channel, which recently posted a 10 hour long video of a lore-accurate recreation of Frodo's epic journey from Bag End to Mordor in Lord of the Rings Online . 'Frodo walks from the Shire to Mordor,' as it's called, is not as dramatic or exciting as Peter Jackson's famed film trilogy: It is literally a recording of Frodo walking— walking , take note, not running, although he does get to ride here and there when the books say so—along the route originally followed by the Fellowship. At various spots along the way, Andy Serkis chimes in to describe the scene via audio clips taken from the Lord of the Rings audiobooks, which as chosen line up remarkably well with the events happening on screen. But even though it lacks the cinematic oomph of an Oscar-winning Hollywood film trilogy, the video is an undeniably impressive undertaking, and I dropped a line to EVG to ask what inspired him to do such a thing. \"Escapism, mainly,\" the channel owner, who asked to go unnamed, replied. \"Like anyone …",

Dwarves, meanwhile, received new toys to stem the tide of besieging goblins, like autocrossbow turret emplacements and metal-fortified walls. Overnight, the fantasy settlement sim has rewritten decades of player defensive strategy. One of the interesting complications added by the Siege Update, however, is an unintentional one. Shortly after the update went live, players started reporting on the Kitfox Games Discord that, inexplicably, dwarves in their forts were dying of starvation and dehydration. And not just any dwarves: The moms were refusing to eat, and their babies were the culprit. (Image credit: Kitfox Games) The problem, you see, is that moms are like horses—in Dwarf Fortress, at least. In DF, mothers always hold their newborn babies until the infants reach an age where they can walk, play, and feed themselves. To achieve that, the game actually uses the same systems that let soldiers ride war mounts: While we're shown a dwarven mo…",

It's not the only multiplayer game boasting huge player counts at the moment, either. Battlefield 6 managed a massive 747,000 concurrent players earlier in the month, off the back of a mostly-well-received launch. Of course, there's no one single reason why both of these games attracted so many players to their respective worlds. Battlefield 6 is the latest entry in a long and storied series, whereas Arc Raiders has taken the extraction shooter formula and refined it down to an easy to learn, hard to master point, to name just two. But I'll tell you one thing I think has made a major difference to those player uptake numbers—low hardware requirements.

If you're wondering \"who the heck is Rokky?\" then it's a new distribution platform that aims to connect publishers with various digital storefronts around the globe.

The question is, of course, at what point does lower latency become undetectable to human senses? According to MCHOSE itself, the 16 kHz version of the Ace 68 Turbo only improves latency over the (presumably cheaper) 8 KHz variant by 0.02 ms, with the Turbo sitting at 0.06 ms rather than 0.08 ms. So, we are talking about hundredths of a millisecond. Can anyone actually feel that? Cue an army of twitch gamers pointing out the huge benefits of 8 kHz mice and how they couldn't possibly slum it with—eugh!—a 4 KHz rodent. Or whatever. Likewise, it wasn't that long ago that the idea of a, say, 500 Hz monitor seemed a bit silly. Surely anything beyond about 240 Hz was beyond human perception?

      "body": "Internet Archive, a non-profit library dedicated to archived websites, music, books, apps, and all kinds of information on the internet, has been subjected to multiple lawsuits since its foundation in 1996. And one aimed at its library has reportedly had a major effect, according to what its founder told Ars Technica . Internet Archive might be most well known for its website archiver, The Wayback Machine, but, in 2020, its Open Library was sued by four major book publishers. Effectively, the Open Library is a digital library, where the Internet Archive would 'loan' digital versions of physical books it owns, to emulate a library. These books would be lent at a 1-1 rate with what it owned. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it created the National Emergency Library in response to libraries shutting down, which removed its prior lending restrictions. In June last year , Hatchet, HarperCollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House won their suit against Internet Archive's Open Library, taking out 500,000 books from the library. The Internet Archive lost its appeal just a few months later , in September 2024. \"We survived… but it wiped out the library,\" Internet Archive founder Brewst…",

By this point, you'll have already been sent to track down everything from lemons and apricots to prickly pears , olives , and a cat bed , yet somehow mushrooms—fungi you'd have thought would overrun old buildings in the post-apocalypse—are among the most annoying to find. Don't worry, though, your search for random food is almost over, and once you know where to look, mushrooms aren't too bad to collect. You'll likely just need to do a few repetitive runs to farm them up. Where to find mushrooms in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) The best places you can find mushrooms are: Inside Hydroponic Dome Complex and on the surrounding trees on the Dam Battlegrounds map. On trees south of Little Hangar in the north of the Spaceport map, just outside the East Container Yard. Generally, mushrooms are located on trees or in dank areas in Nature locations. This is why you'll find multiple spawns inside Hydroponic Dome Complex (often in the little planters) and on the trees surrounding this location …",

But maybe for all the wrong reasons. We'll have a full review in due course. However, the literal out-of-the-box experience with this Kickstarter-funded device is worth a few immediate impressions. This handheld is extraordinary by several measures. First up, it's absolutely massive. The screen is 11 inches. But it comes with a centimetre-plus of bezel all round, plus a pair of huge clip-on controllers. The upshot of which is that the Abxylute 3D One pretty much dwarfs the laptop on which I'm typing these words. It's so big I have serious reservations about how realistic it is as an actual handheld device. I'm not sure I'd want to game with this beast in my actual hands for very long. Moreover, the comparison between gaming handhelds and gaming laptops is often unflattering, in performance terms, for the former.

Beating them all for sheer out-of-this-world coolness, though, is Doom on a satellite, orbiting the Earth. Well, it was . The European Space Agency (ESA) deorbited its OPS-SAT device back in May 2024, but before it was turned into dust motes, Georges Labrèche (engineering manager at ESA) contacted Ólafur Waage, a Norwegian software engineer , to see if he fancied a little challenge. Waage is no random coder, though, as he's a highly experienced game developer , working for Massive Entertainment—makers of Far Cry 6, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, and countless others. The challenge was simple on paper: port Doom to run on OPS-SAT. This satellite was an experiment by the ESA, which could be used by members of the public directly over the Internet. Essentially, if your access was approved, you could upload code to the little satellite (just 10 x 10 x 30 cm in size) and have it do stuff for science. Of course, there's…",

Well, EA is trying to allay some of those fears (via Polygon ). In a new FAQ for employees from October 30, the company promised that it was still \"in a strong financial position\" despite the small matter of $20 billion in debt and that it will \"maintain creative control\" over its projects even in its new era of private ownership. It also promises to maintain \"a thoughtful, steady approach to AI,\" after stories circulated about the new owners planning to make heavy use of the tech . What does that mean in practice?
