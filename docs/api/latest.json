Users will also be able to create new photos and videos using Nano Banana and Veo directly from their TVs, if needed. The updated Gemini experience will initially launch on select TCL devices before expanding to additional Google TV platforms. Gemini on Google TVs is a significant upgrade from Google Assistant, enabling users to issue complex natural language commands that feel perfectly suited for a TV. You can ask questions like “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?” or issue commands like “Find me something to watch with my wife. I like dramas, but she likes lighthearted comedies.” At CES 2026 , Google is upgrading Gemini with new functionality for TVs, alongside expanding it to new platforms.

This hike comes as a result of the increasing prices of internal components, especially DRAM and NAND modules. The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series. So the next obvious step is to speculate on prices, but confusion prevails on that front as well.",

But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

This year at CES , SwitchBot is going all in on generalist smart home products with an actual robot. Meet the onero H1, SwitchBot’s first humanoid robot.

The display combines built-in sensor data with local weather information, including indoor temperature and humidity, air quality, current conditions, and a six-day forecast. It also offers calendar syncing, smart home automations, and AI-powered weather briefings. This year at CES , SwitchBot is introducing a new, information-first display to its smart home lineup, and it’s the kind of device designed to save you from checking your phone (or forgetting your umbrella). The new SwitchBot Weather Station features a 7.5-inch E-Ink display that keeps key household and weather data visible at a glance, without the glare or distractions of a tablet-style screen. It’s meant to live on a counter or entry table, surfacing the information you want before heading out the door. As LCD smart displays continue creeping into more corners of the home, SwitchBot’s E-Ink Weather Station feels like a quieter alternative and a calmer way to keep tabs on your environment.",

The page reveals that Privacy Display will be located in the Settings app, in the Display section. An animation showing how the feature works was also spotted on the page. Samsung has been developing a new feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra called Privacy Display. This feature is designed to dim or hide the display when viewing the screen at an angle, preventing strangers from taking unwanted peeks. Back in September 2025, we spotted code within an alleged build of One UI 8.5 that provided some details about the feature. The following month, more information was revealed when the potential UI for Privacy Display leaked . Another leak has now dropped, and it shows us how this function will work.

Located about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo (the Maiden), NGC 4388 is a resident of the Virgo galaxy cluster. This enormous cluster of galaxies contains more than a thousand members and is the nearest large galaxy cluster to the Milky Way. NGC 4388 appears to tilt at an extreme angle relative to our point of view, giving us a nearly edge-on prospect of the galaxy. This perspective reveals a curious feature that wasn’t visible in a&nbsp; previous Hubble image of this galaxy &nbsp;released in 2016: a plume of gas from the galaxy’s nucleus, here seen billowing out from the galaxy’s disk toward the lower-right corner of the image.

Pre-orders begin today for $199, with shipping starting in May. 2025 was a surprisingly big year for Pebble fans. Last March, former Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky unexpectedly launched two new Pebble smartwatches : the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

The phone adds Proton apps inside a locked-down Vault, while still allowing wider app access through a Wild Web section.

Swiss phone maker Punkt is back at CES 2026 with a familiar message and a slightly more refined pitch. The company has unveiled the MC03, its latest privacy-focused smartphone, aimed at people who want more control over how their phone behaves and how much data it shares. All without completely abandoning modern apps and services. The MC03 builds on the idea behind the earlier MC02 , but Punkt says this new model is more clearly split into two areas. There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows.

Smartphone owners may feel insulated from these swings, since we don’t buy or install mobile RAM ourselves. However, the same forces driving up PC memory prices are quietly reshaping the smartphones we may plan to purchase next year. Here’s what you need to know.",

Cloud-based gaming is bigger than ever right now, whether you’re using services like Xbox Game Pass or just streaming games on your Switch . But despite this clearly being a viable business model, Google just couldn’t figure out how to make it work, and now we’re quickly coming up on the three-year anniversary of the company shutting down Stadia . While that was a very public failure for Google, the company still tried to make the best of the situation by giving Stadia hardware a new lease on life — and if you haven’t taken advantage of that yet, there’s an important deadline we’re running up against.

Reading mode now lives permanently in the three-dot menu and keeps the address bar visible while reading. The update requires Chrome 143 and a manual flag toggle for now, suggesting a limited test rollout. Reading mode has been available in Chrome on Android for a while, but using it has never been particularly reliable. It only appeared on certain pages , relied on Chrome deciding whether an article qualified, and could vanish just as quickly as it showed up, which made it easy to forget the feature existed at all. That looks like it might be changing. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Today, a new report includes some key details about the project, which could be some kind of AI-integrated pen. According to a tweet from industry tipster Smart Pikachu , OpenAI’s forthcoming gadget will “likely” be produced by Foxconn, the contract manufacturer that assembles products like the iPhone and recent Pixel phone models. The tweet goes on to say that the initiative could take the shape of “a pen” and/or “a ‘to-go’ audio device.”",

The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers. We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",

Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020. The date, combined with the bubble-like appearance of the galaxies and the superheated gas seen with Chandra observations (represented in purple), inspired the scientists to nickname the galaxy cluster the Champagne Cluster, a much easier-to-remember name than its official designation of RM J130558.9+263048.4. The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters.
