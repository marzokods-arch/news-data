      "body": "The most notable thing about this year's list of PC Gamer's highest review scores is what doesn't appear on it. Many of the games that are in the running for one of our Game of the Year awards aren't represented, including Elden Ring Nightreign, Battlefield 6, Europa Universalis 5, Arc Raiders, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Those games all received favorable scores by our standards, just not quite favorable enough to pass the bar I've set here, which is 89%-and-up. Clair Obscur received what was probably our most controversial score of the year at 70% —still a recommendation for the French RPG, though not the shining praise it got elsewhere. (Including from some of PCG's other writers.) Reviews aren't a measure of popularity or an attempt to arrive at the average opinion, so I don't consider these notable absences a bug. There's a lot to appreciate about the two most-played new games right now, Battlefield 6 ( 82% ) and Arc Raiders ( 86% ), but to get a really high score, a game has to inspire an individual reviewer to go out on a limb and champion it, perhaps even pushing back on editors whose responsibility it is to ask, \"OK, but is it actually a 92%?\" As 2025 draws to a clos…",

Patch 0.4.0 will be out in \"early December,\" according to a post on the official forums. \"We will reveal the livestream and release date very soon, so keep an eye on the news,\" it reads. That also means that the current season, or league, will be ending in a few weeks and everyone's characters will be sent to live on the standard version of the game before the new update hits. It's a short post for what will likely be a big patch. Creative director Mark Roberts told PC Gamer in a recent interview that the developer wasn't expecting to rework the endgame experience, which is one of the reasons Path of Exile 2 won't have a full release this year. The first step in that rework already happened in a recent patch , but the bulk of the changes are still yet to come. The g…",

Another expert noted that its tone resembled \"a high-school drama club's Elizabethan improv night.\" That sounds pretty bad. As a result, Silksong's Steam rating briefly fell to \"mostly negative\", and ever since a fan group called Team Cart Fix has been working away in the background to improve the Chinese translation. The fruits of their labour have been available as an unofficial mod for a while, but now, in Silksong's new Patch 4, the work of Team Cart Fix has been officially implemented in the game. \"Their translation builds from elements of the original Silksong translation, retaining existing names for most characters and places, except in instances where the original translation was incorrect, or inconsistent with Hollow Knight,\" Team Cherry writes . \"Most importantly, this is a translation by fans who are well-v…",

Blizzard released a roadmap at the start of the year and pretty much everything on it has come and gone. A few things have shifted around—like leaderboards coming earlier than expected next season—but the new expansion for 2026 still hasn't been announced. In a recent interview with Diablo 4 streamer Rob2628 , the developers gave a pretty clear hint on when the expansion news will finally arrive. Rob brought up an image recently datamined from the game that reads December 12 in Chinese, which happens to be the same day (taking time zones in account) as this year's The Game Awards show. He asked associate game director Zaven Haroutunian and lead live game designer Colin Finer if Diablo fans should watch it. Haroutunian, leaning close to his webcam and smiling, replied, \"Everyone should be watching it.

As promised by DICE lead producer David Sirland last week, the quality-of-life update will address the gun dispersion issues, incorrect vehicle spawns, the unstoppable lock-on missile , and most notably, the \"drone hammer\" bug that let players levitate on command. That last bug fix could be a particularly big ideal, as folks were using the levitation exploit to get high up on maps that have no air vehicles and land on out-of-bounds rooftops on Siege of Cairo. This is also the first major update for Redsec, Battlefield 6's free-to-play battle royale mode. That knocks a few big problems off the to-do list, though to be honest, my biggest gripes with Battlefield 6 are problems that will take a lot longer to address: the lack of big maps and the terrible UI. Sirland acknowledged both topics in his AMA last week, but gave no timeline or indicated they were huge priorities. The good news is we're getting one new big map next week: Eastwood . Update 1.1.1.5 arrives on November 11 at 9 AM UTC. Here are the full patch notes: PLAYER Fixed an issue where dispersion would be higher than intended when going from sprint t…",

The many different ways you play and participate in ARC Raiders have completely blown us away, going far beyond what we ever imagined. You surprise us, you outsmart us, and you keep us on our toes.

Still, Arabella's patter with Withers is a charming, unexpected bit of writing that punches above its weight in shading more depth into both characters: Withers clearly has a soft spot for children, and Arabella has no problem chopping it up with an immortal watcher. Seeing more of that relationship is certainly welcome.

Taking a leaf from the 'Windows where it shouldn't be' chapter out of the modder's playbook, one solo tinkerer has built a throwback handheld gaming PC that's rocking Pentium inside. Built by maker Changliang Li , his Windows 98 handheld gaming PC plays all the contemporaneous hits, like StarCraft and Tomb Raider II (with of-the-era frame rates, too). Contained in a 3D printed, plastic shell spray painted an authentic shade of yellow that harkens back to its forebears, the homebrew handheld even features a Logitech rollerball mouse (via Hackaday ). As for mouse clicks , those are tied to a lonely little trigger button on the top right-hand corner of the console. It's a control scheme that looks as nightmarish as it is extra, but that's not the most interesting facet of the project. Given how svelte APU chips have to be to fit inside even the bulkiest of today's best handheld gaming PCs , it's worth remembering how bulky 90s desktop mainboards used to be—so, how does this throwback build achieve such a reasonable form factor?

The anniversary has got Bethesda creative chief Todd Howard in a reflective mood, and he's revealed some interesting details about the creation of the game and what the RPG maestros learned from it. One of the main things Bethesda learned is that cinematic, Mass Effect-style dialogue systems are a bad fit for Bethesda games. In an interview with GQ , Howard was asked what he thought the best game he'd worked on is. Responding diplomatically, Howard pointed to several features of multiple games, while also mentioning that some things \"didn't resonate\" with players. After a bit of coaxing, Howard revealed that Fallout 4's dialogue system was one of them. \"We spent forever on the dialogue system in Fallout 4,\" Howard said. \"'How do we do an interactive conversation in an interesting way? How do we make that gamey? But it really did not resonate. It was also hard on our designers to write that way.\" Elaborating on why the dialogue system didn't resonate, Howard explained …",

But BG2 didn't emerge in a vacuum, and in a recent chat with Slandered Gaming it emerged that—while we can thank BG2 for a lot of our favourite RPGs since—we have a whole other game to thank for BG2. That'd be Final Fantasy 7, which lit a fire under BG2 director James Ohlen to go all out with the game's structure and companions, per Trent Oster—who worked on the original Baldur's Gate and has since become CEO of Beamdog, the studio behind the BG1 and BG2 Enhanced Editions. \"So, James had played Final Fantasy 7, and they had character interaction and romance, and he was scared shitless,\" recalls Oster.

It launched in early access a year ago, but it's been on my mind again thanks to Arc Raiders , the current new hotness. Before Arc Raiders' explosive launch , our reviewer, Elie, was telling me why they were digging it so much, and it became clear that it coincidentally shared a lot with what I remain convinced is the genre's high point.

You'll first have to find the EMP trap in Victory Ridge (West Broken Ridge) and then go to each switch location in turn to power it down. All that said, here's how to complete Straight Record in Arc Raiders and locate the three power switches.

As obvious as it sounds, it's worth pointing out that you get these Firing Cores from Arc Sentinels, which are sniper turrets attached to ceilings in just a few specific locations, and are different to the regular turrets you commonly encounter. You're less likely to run into these naturally compared to almost all other Arc types. With that in mind, tracking them down for their cores proves to be a time-consuming task.

But there may be another reason behind those layoffs, namely that the player count for Dune: Awakening is dwindling. In fact, for the first time since Dune: Awakening launched, the number of players recently dropped below that of Funcom's other survival MMO, Conan Exiles, which released way back in 2018. The shift was spotted by Reddit user m3d1t8 (via GamesRadar ), who posted a screenshot showing that, at the time it was taken, 7,458 players were exploring Arrakis, while 7,706 players were enjoying Conan Exiles. \"The unbelievable has happened and Dune now has fewer active players than Conan,\" m3d1t8 marvelled, adding. \"I remember two months ago someone foreseeing that Dune would dip below Conan and thinking no wayyyy.

However, company CEO He Xiaopeng has since attempted to expose the Iron's mechanical innards, both on-stage and off (via Mashable ). After offering a sneak peek of what lies beneath the Iron's soft shell on social media , Xiaopeng then took to the stage for a more drastic demonstration. For the banishment of all doubt, the Xpeng robotics team took a pair of scissors to the Iron, cutting away not only its soft outer shell but its artificial muscles as well, completely exposing the metal rod supports and servos below. The Iron is very clearly not a person in a morph suit—however, that doesn't mean it's the future either.

With that said, there is no information regarding its contents, or when to expect it. Only that there will be another update in due course. In fact, the video opens the floor to players to share what they'd like to see when REPO receives its next drop rather than the decision being down to the devs. Since we've just received a fresh batch of monsters, I can't imagine we'll be getting any new creatures any time soon, but a lot of people are keen to see new locations over anything else. As part of the monster update, REPO received a bunch of new valuables too, each corresponding to their location rather than being a random selection available through each map.

      "body": "TSMC is a huge player in the tech industry. Being the world's largest producer of semiconductors, it has clients from Apple to Qualcomm, all the way to Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, fresh off the company being valued at $5 trillion , recently went out to Hsinchu County in northwestern Taiwan to acknowledge TSMC's role in Nvidia's success. \"Without TSMC, there is no Nvidia today\", the Nvidia chief said at TSMC's Sports Day last week ( via Focus Taiwan ). This is certainly true. You see TSMC chips in everything from the latest Blackwell GPUs (like the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 ) to the AI chips that have helped prop up Nvidia's worth. Huang told the crowd, \"You are really the pride of Taiwan, you are also the pride of the world, and you know that you are also my pride\". Huang was born in Taiwan and has Taiwanese citizenship, which might give extra reason for that last part. TSMC is in a unique spot for Taiwan, being one of the biggest companies in the country. The looming threat of tariffs has caused some worries around supply, but it has a fab in Arizona, with more expected to come, and a $100 billion investment was made in the US earlier this year. This is to say, TSMC is i…",

Elsewhere, a French website Dealabs (via Gamespot ) provided further evidence of the symbols' authenticity, discovering the words \"crossbuy-tag\" within some CSS files on the PlayStation Store. Since the term \"Cross-Buy\" has been used by Sony since the PS-Vita days, Dealabs also checked when the new symbols were added to the store, and discovered they first appeared in June this year.

The man has a point. Valve stands apart from its competition in being a private company.

Unlike Epic, Amazon, Ubisoft, or EA (though, uh, I suppose that last one's set to change ), Valve only really has to answer to its president, Gabe Newell, and he's busy buying yacht companies .

The Aliexpress-bought Wi-Fi lightbulb had the glass structure sawn off with a serrated knife, exposing the tiny BL602 RISC-V chip inside, before the board was soldered to a surrogate microcontroller with an appropriate USB port and a few extra wires. This looks to have enabled the now Frankenstein-ed bulb board to run Vimpo's own Minecraft server implementation, called Ucraft. Controlling the bulb-based server with the help of a few other devices, including a small external display and a full-sized keyboard that frankly dwarfs every other piece of hardware involved, results in a very-playable looking implementation. If you'd like a poke around in Ucraft's files, Vimpo has uploaded their work to GitHub .

Arc Raiders has been on a monumental run since it launched a couple of weeks back. Hitting 100,000 concurrent players in just 30 minutes and briefly surpassing Battlefield 6 in concurrent players a few days ago, it seems like the gaming world has been enamoured with Embark's new extraction shooter, and I can't see the enthusiasm waning anytime soon.

Helldivers 2, in contrast, has an all-time peak of just 458,709 , and that's including my squad.

This is a world where one of my team is an alien and another is a demon. Maybe ghosts are real too? I'd hate to write off someone who turns out to have Sadako in their cellar. Dispatch is an adventure game whose creators include a bunch of ex-Telltale staff, so like The Walking Dead one of the main ways it adds interactivity is with choice and consequence. Which superhero do you go on a date with? Who do you drop from the team? But where Telltale games also retained rudimentary walk-around-and-look-at-stuff scenes from their point-and-click ancestors like vestigial limbs, Dispatch ditches them in favor of being more like an interactive cartoon—with high-quality animation and acting—until suddenly it drops you into a shift working as a dispatcher.

On November 7, Owlcat shared the game's main theme from composer Paweł Perepelica, who previously scored Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous and Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader for the studio. It's hard get crazy excited about music from an upcoming game, but Osiris Reborn's main theme kinda goes. That combination of a very space opera, orchestral sound with more cyberpunk synths puts me right back in that 2007, saving the galaxy headspace. It doesn't hurt that Mass Effect and The Expanse draw from the same well of gritty, '90s and aughts, military-inflected, Sci-Fi Syfy Channel sci-fi⁠—even if Mass Effect tempered it with a more wide eyed, mid-20th century sensibility.

It boasts a low barrier to entry due to non-prohibitive system requirements , and those requirements are so low fans have been putting it through the wringer to see just how old a GPU can run it . More recently, YouTuber Fully Buffered (via Tom's Hardware ) got the game to run on an AMD FX-9590 CPU , first released in 2013, revealing that the game's stated minimum required specs are a bit misleading. Fully Buffered broke down his process in the above video, where he shows the game running on the 12-year-old chip to a quality standard he calls \"not terrible.\" It peaks at around mid-40 FPS at lower resolutions, though input lag kneecaps the feasibility of playing this way for very long. The poor GPU, an RX 5700, is shown hovering around 30% utilization in Task Manager, its potency shown a hard ceiling by the comparatively ancient processor. Regardless, it's remarkable that it runs at all—and not just because of the severe bottleneck. As the video highlights, Battlefield 6 requires Trusted Platform Module 2.0—a fe…",

It's still in early access, but it's free from the usual gamut of cash shop items and battle passes; and if that sounds good to you, you might want to grab it on sale before its impending price increase this Tuesday, Nov. 11. Titan Quest 2 is a hack-and-slash a la Diablo or Path of Exile inspired by Greek myth. It's only going up by 5 dollars, but it's on sale until then for $26.99. When PC Gamer online editor Fraser Brown gave the game a spin , he said \"stepping into the sandals of my Greek hero felt like travelling back in time to a simpler era, when you could enjoy an ARPG without intense number crunching, theorycrafting or engaging in live service systems.\" In fact, he said in his impressions the game was occasionally so placid that it didn't quite live up to the grand stakes of Greek legend—though the game has been upping the ante with new regions and bosses since its early access launch.

Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. When I started playing Minecraft, the way most people would dress as the characters involved a large cardboard box atop their shoulders, and then wearing a colour-coordinated outfit to match the character. It was simple but incredibly effective. After all, all you really need to identify a Minecraft character are its main features, and for the most part these were on its head and face.
