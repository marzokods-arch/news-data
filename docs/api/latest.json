      "body": "The future of Prince of Persia has never seemed more fraught, as Ubisoft's money men announce a major reshuffling at the company . Jobs have been lost and multiple games have been cancelled, including the long-delayed and much-wanted remake of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. While the fate of Ubisoft's many studios is the more pressing concern (including staff already going on strike), along with the threat of a pivot towards even more live service games and generative AI, a gamer-level problem is that one of Ubi's most iconic adventures exists in a surprisingly sorry state. Fortunately we're PC gaming nerds, and we know how to solve such problems. Where to buy Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time If you don't already own a modern digital copy of Sands Of Time, you've got a few options. The first and most convenient is Steam , where the game goes for around $12 (£9). At the time of writing, the Ubisoft Store has the game discounted down to under $3 (£2), although, yes, you'll have to download it through their app. You can launch it through Steam after doing so.

The letter's signatories, led by Labor Caucus co-chairs Steven Horsford, Debbie Dingell, Mark Pocan, and Donald Norcross, say they have \"serious concerns\" that the acquisition will lead to layoffs, studio closures, wage suppression, and an unwelcome concentration of sports and entertainment brand ownership that could lead to \"anticompetitive coordination.\" Median worker pay at EA has declined steeply year over year, the letter states, a trend that suggests the company \"may already face limited competitive pressure to retain or reward talent.\" It goes on to say that EA has eliminated more than 1,700 jobs since 2023 and warns that even deeper cuts could result if the acquisition is closed because of the massive debt financing involved, \"which creates strong incentives for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting mea…",

So when I stumbled across the Isometric NYC city map project, I was at first properly stoked—and then deeply conflicted. Isometric NYC is the one-man effort of Andy Coenen, attempting to render all of New York City in an isometric pixel art style distinctly reminiscent of the SimCity series . But rather than laboriously building this city pixel-by-pixel, Coenen has instead leveraged multiple AI agents to create this city map. The entire process required much more work than dashing off a handful of prompts, but you are perhaps beginning to understand my sense of conflict. Coenen himself is a software engineer currently conducting AI research at Google DeepMind . He explains that the original idea for Isometric NYC was to use Google's \" Nano Banana to generate a pixel art map from satellite imagery tile-by-tile,\" though Coenen ultimately used…",

My favourite part of the feature isn't the info on the games I played, but how long I've had my GOG account. It's been active for six years, back before I was even a videogame journalist.

This should help give new players an easier time as they get to grips with all the horrors Topside.

The original ROG Azoth was a triumph that walked the tricky line wonderfully, packing in nice-to-haves such as lubricated switches, reliable wireless connectivity and hot-swappable powers into a smart, compact chassis. This new ROG Azoth 96 HE takes some of what Asus has built up to this point and tears it up. For instance, it's not mechanical in the same sense as its predecessors (or siblings, I suppose), as Asus has opted to go for its ROG HFX V2 Hall effect switches for gaming precision and power, rather than the increased tactility of a traditional mechanical switch. These have been upgraded over the older V1 switches kitted out to other Asus keyboards with Hall effect powers and were first seen on the Asus ROG Falcata , with optimisations such as a shorter overall travel (3.5 mm vs 4 mm) that's more noticeable in use than you'd think, plus a larger magnet for more precise customisation. It's now possible to set the actuation or reset point in increments of 0.01 mm, which is not somet…",

In a YouTube AMA ( spotted by GamesRadar+ ) Downes says he never wants to see AI used to replicate his voice. \"That's where we cross a line that gets into an area that I am uncomfortable with,\" says Downes. \"I'm not a proponent. I don't like it, and I would prefer that it not be done.\" Perhaps conscious that he works in an industry where AI use is increasingly widespread, and does offer limited use cases, Downes does go on to slightly soften his stance outside of the topic of his own voice. AI can have \"many, many positive effects on not only showbusiness but humanity in general\" says Downes, but \"can also be something that deprives the actor of his work. I'll go on the record with that.\" It's not quite Neil Newborn, Astarian in Baldur's Gate 3 among many other things, coming out and saying of AI : \"It's shit… AI sucks.\" But at least it shows…",

So if you’ve ever wanted one of AMD’s thundering 16-core Zen 5 chips in your portable(ish) PC, this is your chance. It’s fast, though not 9950X3D fast. An unfair comparison considering the desktop chip doesn’t have to deal with the constrained thermal envelope and limited power draw of a laptop, and the 3D V-Cache really does make a difference. Despite the rainbow keyboard and presence of an RTX 5080 GPU, you’ll be surprised to hear this this isn’t a gaming laptop. MSI positions it as “engineered for the demands of STEM professionals,” which probably doesn’t mean gardeners, and then takes a puff on some burning leaves to huskily exhale the phrase “it operates like a high-tech brain”. Yeah, man. The Vector A18 HX may well “deliver the performance and reliability engineers need to excel in every challenge,” but luckily for us it also delivers the kind of frame rates that make PC gamers very happy, and is so obviously a gaming laptop in an unconvincing disguise with its 240 Hz display, seven heat pipes, and two fans to keep it all cool.

But, reaching an ugly peak in Forza Horizon 5, there's been a frustrating trend to carve away at that feeling of career progression in favour of more freedom. You could immediately take part in almost any event and get a supercar in minutes in FH5. In fact, you could easily have a whole garage of supercars in no time—for free—thanks to the Wheelspin system. Not exactly what I'd call a career mode, and it quickly diminished any satisfaction from performing well to earn money and save up for your first fancy ride. This leads me to the one line from Xbox's recent Developer Direct , which finally opened the hood on Forza Horizon 6 , that instantly brought me on board: Torben Ellert, design director of FH6, said, \"You'll start out as just a tourist in Japan.\" Ellert explains that \"your first goal is to join the Horizon Festival by completing the Horizon qualifiers.

Anyway, this is all to say that I think the most recent update to the Steam client—itself essentially a packaging of a bunch of fixes that have been pushed to Steam's beta branch recently—is, stealthily, very much about prepping for Valve's black box. I say this because Steam's January 21 client update practically vibrates with controller fixes and updates. Support for the Nintendo Switch 2 wired controller has been re-enabled, there are new settings for joystick responses, fixes for gyro aiming, and plenty else besides (find the full list down below).

I purchased the Peerless Assassin 120 SE V2, a version of the cooler with six heatpipes, for £26. It's currently $33 on Amazon US . Thermalright has around 40,000 variants of any one cooler, all with names using a combination of around ten words, and spanning nine pages on its website . I opted for one of the cheapest available at the time, but if you wanted something prettier, there are many more to choose from. It arrived in a nondescript brown cardboard box, which slightly tempered my expectations for the cooler within. Though I shouldn't have judge a cooler by its box here; it's a mighty impressive unit once you remove it from the packaging. It's much larger than the other budget options I've reviewed recently, including the Arctic Freezer 36 and Cooler Master Hyper 212 Pro . It's a dual-tower cooler, one…",

If you're wondering why that's a big deal, it's not to most gamers . If you have a Windows 11 PC with relatively new hardware, you should be able to enable all with little problem. However, Secure Boot, as shown with the launch of Battlefield 6 , tends to draw criticism. That's for three major reasons. The first is that Secure Boot is a kernel-level security measure, and anti-cheat software that uses it will effectively get privileged access to the inner sanctuary of your PC. Secondly, older machines may not support Secure Boot or might not even have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is used to store cryptographic keys. This means older machines are left in the dust. However, one of the biggest complaints levied at Secure Boot is on behalf of Linux gamers. While Linux does have something called Secure Boot, that's not w…",

When Hooded Horse signs devs, it's right there in the contract. \"It's one of those things that we have a union of being aligned with our developers and with players,\" says Bender. \"Players don't, by and large, want gen AI.\" This isn't just a ban on gen AI art in the finished game, but in the earlier stages too.

Basically, if something's bothering you—like, say, the recent transmog updates—it's not going to stay that way for long. In case you're unfamiliar, WoW's recently rehashed its transmog (a glamour/outfit system) to work on specific outfits you buy slots for with in-game gold. This has the upshot of not requiring you to visit a transmog specialist every time you get a new piece of gear, while reducing flexibility—due, in part, to the gold cost. Given you'll be saving money on not doing repeat visits to your favourite ethereal, Blizzard reasoned that this new way of doing things ought to be more expensive.

Lunar Lake is particularly at-risk from the ongoing memory crisis, which has seen memory in tight supply and prices skyrocket, due to its use of on-package memory. Take a look at the package and you can see two LPDDR5X chips nestled besides the processor. This has benefits for efficiency and size, but has caused some headaches for Intel. One issue from the get-go was price. Extra chips, more packaging steps, and securing memory all add to the cost of production for Lunar Lake versus other chips. As such, Lunar Lake has not offered the sort of margins that Intel would like, and buying more memory at today's prices would make matters worse. \"Th…",

After a while, you then start experiencing all kinds of problems, until eventually your gaming PC no longer fires up: the CPU is dead. That's happened to some owners of ASRock motherboards, but it's also apparently occurring with Asus models, and the company has launched an investigation into it all.

That's no surprise, but with the ongoing memory crisis making upgrading your processor and motherboard a very expensive ordeal, we had worried for both Intel and AMD's forthcoming generations. In Intel's Q4 earnings call, the company's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, confirmed the upcoming release window for Nova Lake: \"Along with our next-generation Nova Lake coming at the end of 2026. We now have a client roadmap that combines best-in-class performance with cost-optimized solutions giving me confidence that we are on the path of 45% market share and profitability in both notebooks and desktops over the next several years,\" Tan said (transcript via SeekingAlpha ) Nova Lake could be a big improvement over Arrow lake. I'm not getting my hopes up just yet, but it's rumoured to include a big last level cache (literally called bLLC) that will act as an analogue to 3D V-Cache on AMD Ryzen chips. Moreover, VP John Pitzer said he thought Intel would hold a leadership position with the launch of Nova Lake .

Alas, Armored Core: Mobile 3 is not likely an instalment the masses will embrace. It was originally released for flip phones in 2007, and further complicating matters, it was a Japanese exclusive. While that's not exactly the case now—you can easily go and buy Armored Core: Mobile 3 on Steam right now—few will have the patience to play it without English subs. Indeed, no major efforts have been made to modernize this ancient artefact, though it does appear to have controller support. Here's the trailer: If that's not enough to discourage you, it's pretty cool to have this curio made available again. It takes place between Armored Core Nexus and Armored Core Last Raven, both of which were offshoots of Armored Core 3.

The new game is in the hands of Forza Horizon studio Playground Games, which has very little in common with the old Lionhead except for—perhaps crucially—its Britishness. In an interview published by Xbox, Fable game director Ralph Fulton discussed how the studio dealt with taking on a storied series from a once-venerated studio. \"One of the things I said to the team was, ‘Look, we’re not Lionhead—we can’t try to make a Lionhead game.’ This has to be a Playground game because I’m a really firm believer that the personality and the character of a team is visible in the work they do and the games they make.\" Fulton went on: \"And I think you can see Lionhead in that original trilogy. It would be pointless, I think, for us to try and ape that. And that’s really at the heart of the reboot question, right? It felt imperative to me that this was a reboot because we’re starting again as Playground Games, and making Playground’s Fable.\" One sacrosanct part of the Fab…",

In DreadBound's first trailer, I clocked instantly deploying spike traps, oil slicks to trip enemies (or set them on fire), Ravenholm-style circular saw projectiles that you can embed in walls and use as platforms to reach high places, and an homage to my favorite quick melee in all of gaming, the Dark Messiah kick. Rather than the handcrafted levels typical of immersive sims, DreadBound will feature \"a cursed city that changes every time you die.\" That gave this Roguelikephobic gamer some pause, but roguelike and immsim, when attempted in the past, have often proven to be a chocolate and peanut butter genre combo.

And it's setting the bar high. \"Although our game is a new beginning,\" said game director Ralph Fulton, \"I think what we're making is really faithful to the spirit of the classic Lionhead trilogy that we all love.\" The core of the new Fable is freedom, choices, and consequences: Setting off in the wake of disaster as Albion's first hero in a generation, you'll explore a seamless open world, visiting new and familiar locations alike including Bowerstone, \"a huge city full of contrasts: rich and poor, nobles and commoners, royalty and criminals.\" Your character will be fully customizable in both appearance and abilities, with access to melee and ranged combat options as well as powerful magic spells. There's also plenty of \"normal, everyday stuff\" to do in Albion: Jobs, romance, home ownership, becoming a landlord and making life miserable for your tenants, which of course will be reflected in their opinions…",

It's real pretty, but Starhelm is also making some exciting promises on the gameplay front: Shadowglass is planned to be an immersive sim drawing on the stealth game GOAT, Thief: The Dark Project.

Beast of Reincarnation was first unveiled last June, and its unique visual identity really speaks to me. The beautiful Japanese countryside, mystical elements, and samurai protagonist (complete with wide-brimmed kasa ) remind me of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, but the postapocalyptic world is also suffused with overgrown, rusted megastructures and gangly automatons that call to mind Square Enix's beloved Nier series. And let me be clear: Nier is beloved to me . The NieR connection isn't just visual: Beast of Reincarnation is similarly set thousands of years into Earth's future, where humanity is struggling against a plague of evil magical plants, as well as a distinctly Yoko Taro-flavored race of transhumanist robots gone wrong. \"The Golems are beings created when former humans transferred their souls into mechanical b…",

The studio says it's blending in-depth photogrammetry and field recordings captured from across Japan with new audiovisual tech like dynamic tire wear and improved environmental acoustics. It even says it's paid particular attention to modeling how cherry blossom petals react to passing cars. It's in Japan, see. Horizon 6 is, we're told, bigger—in a lot of ways.
