Whether I get extraction camped or betrayed by some randomer who lied about being friendly, death is never too far away in Arc Raiders, especially when people have Trigger Nades.

I had innocently wandered up to the extract to call it, only to be met with a flash of light and sudden death as some rat had placed a couple of Trigger Nades on the call button and scuttled away into the bushes to wait for their victim.

Turns out, that 'next-gen' AMD CPU option is one of the not actually all that new Ryzen AI 400 chips, specifically the AMD Ryzen AI 9 465.

Notably, Dell isn't offering discrete graphics options with the new laptops, the implication being that the iGPU in the new Panther Lake CPU makes that unnecessary. Putting aside the fact that killing off the XPS brand never seemed like a good idea, Dell's new laptops certainly look like a promising return for the XPS line. Initially, Dell is launching the XPS 14 and XPS 16, with a 13-inch model to follow. Key attributes for the XPS 14 and 16 models include extremely high quality build quality, the \"best battery life in the industry\" and optional tandem OLED displays. Chassis-wise, the laptops have an all-new design that has some similarities with previous XPS laptops, but does away with the capacitive function keys that proved so controversial, returning that top row of buttons to the keyboard proper. Dell has also added subtle etching on the otherwise seamless glass trackpad panel below the keyboard, again addressing a design issue with the previous XPS design, which left users guessing exactly w…",

Well, you get something like the new Asus ROG G1000 : a hulking monster of a rig with three holographic fans.

The G1000 boasts one 380 mm fan with 720 LEDs and two 215 mm fans with 404 lights. These don't blast air around the PC; instead, they spin up to a point where you visually can't see the blades in motion and via a button on the top panel (or through Asus' Armoury Crate software), signals are sent to the lights to create patterns, animations, and so on before your eyes. I'm doing a poor job of describing it, so watch Asus' video above to get the full picture (if you pardon the pun).

Hongxing is a pretty well-regarded hardware leaker, though, so there's at least some air of credibility to this, though there's also a chance this could be referring just to the China market.

Perceived motion blur on a monitor, to simplify a little, is essentially caused by the perception that pixels are still hanging around in their previous position after they've moved on to their new spot. That's not really what's happening, of course. This can either be caused by a a slow pixel transition to a new value, or it can be caused by our eyes still holding on to the previous frame for a little too long after the image has changed.

      "body": "Intel has finally taken the last wraps off its Panther Lake-based Core Ultra Series 3 range of mobile chips, and it's making some pretty impressive claims about their performance. Before the expected AI NPU TOPS figures, Intel's VP of PC products, Dan Rogers, dedicated a fair chunk of the company's CES 2026 presentation to the gaming chops of the 18A-based silicon. Ah, it's nice to have a win over the endless AI guff, isn't it? Anyway, headline news is that Intel is claiming up to a 77% integrated graphics performance boost over the previous Lunar Lake-based Intel Core Ultra 9 288V with the top end chips. That's a pretty bold statement, given how impressed we were with Lunar Lake's gaming performance overall. (Image credit: Future) Intel has also promised much improvement in its GPU driver stack, which, if true, could make these mobile beasties a force to be reckoned with for slim and light gaming machines. Key to the claimed performance figures are the architectural changes under the silicon hood. Next to some newly-redesigned P and E-cores lies what Intel calls a \"massive GPU\" for the high end Core Ultra X7 and X9 chips, complete with built-in ray tracing support. The iGPU in qu…",

Though, I'm guessing your mileage may vary. MFG (or Multi Frame Generation if you're not into the whole brevity thing) was introduced at CES last year as one of the fancy new features of the RTX Blackwell GPU generation. It follows the now-familiar pattern of the original DLSS Frame Generation style of using a mixture of frame interpolation, optical flow calculations, and AI image generation to smooth out your gameplay. Except with MFG on RTX Blackwell chips you're adding in up to three completely generated frames in between each actually rendered one, and now using a new optical flow AI model instead of dedicated accelerator hardware with an enhanced display engine to help frame pacing.

If I give you one thing to walk away with, it's the following: the consumer business is important to Dell.\" The whole briefing felt very much like a mea culpa from the massive PC box shifter, but it looks like the company is putting its product where its marketing mouth is, what with the return of the XPS brand, reining back its effusive AI marketing, and throwing cheaper Alienware notebooks out into the wild.

And when it comes to the newly launched Ryzen 7 9850X3D, that 'little' really isn't very big at all. The listed specifications for the Ryzen 7 9850X3D are entirely unsurprising, not least because all the previous leaks and rumours on the new chip all tallied on the point of it just sporting a small increase to the boost clock. It's literally just a Ryzen 7 9800X3D , with a 7.7% overclock. (Image credit: AMD) It's not the first Zen 5 X3D processor that AMD has released that's faster than the 9800X3D, though. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D has two core chiplets (CCDs), one with 3D V-cache, and one without. When it comes to boost clocks, the latter can hit 5.7 GHz, whereas the former topped out at 5.5 GHz in the tests I carried out in my review of the 9950X3D . This suggests that the CCDs rolling off TSMC's production lines are generally very high quality, resulting in a surfeit of CCDs that, when they've also gone through the V-cache packing routine, are more than capable …",

They've either rebadged old chips or just expanded current ranges with a few more models. However, the Ryzen AI Max series of APUs has picked up two extra processors, and one of them could well be the best chip to fit into any top-tier handheld gaming PC. As a quick refresher, Ryzen AI Max processors (aka Strix Halo ) comprise one or two core chiplets (CCDs) plus a huge input/output chiplet (IOD) that houses a pretty beefy GPU. It has 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units (2560 shaders), with 64 MB of Level 3 cache, and a unified memory bus that's 256-bits wide. (Image credit: AMD) Up until now, the only entry in the series that sported the full 40 CUs was the very expensive Ryzen AI Max+ 395 . That all changes with the two new chips: the Max+ 392 and Max+ 388. The former has two CCDs for 12 cores, 24 threads in total, whereas the latter uses a single CCD sporting 8 cores, 16 threads. The current Ryzen AI Max 385 is also a single CCD chip, but its GPU only houses 32 CUs. With the Max+ 388, you're getting the best Strix Halo processor for gaming: 8 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores/CUs.

It's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.\" Sarzynski also pointed out that while some players ended up losing Jackie very quickly, others (including, possibly, yours truly) \"manage to squeeze 20h out of Watson,\" Cyberpunk 2077's opening area, where players are confined before embarking on the big Arasaka heist.

It's a 360 Hz 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide, for a start. That puts it in the upper echelons of gaming monitor desirability right from the off, as QD-OLED panels feature in some of our favourite displays . It's got a 0.03 ms response time, as you'd expect from an OLED display, which, combined with the super-speedy refresh rate, should make it a pretty lust-worthy monitor for anyone with a fast-paced multiplayer game obsession. High up on the spec sheet is what's referred to as \"next-generation V-stripe QD-OLED panel technology\", which HP says provides much improvement to the picture quality with less text fringing. V-stripe refers to a particular type of sub-pixel layout that puts the green sub-pixel above the red and the blue, creating an inverted \"V\".

Maybe it's that January arrives to see us flush with holiday cash and looking to link up with friends instead of spending more time with relatives, but the first couple months of the year always seem to be dominated by surprisingly huge co-op hits. My incontrovertible evidence: 2025: REPO (February) : 271,571 concurrent players 2024: Palworld (January) : 2,101,867 concurrents 2023: Sons of the Forest (February) : 414,257 concurrents 2022: *crickets* 2021: Valheim (February) : 502,387 concurrents Admittedly I couldn't really find something that fits for 2022. (Lost Ark blew up huge in February 2022 to the tune of 1,325,305 concurrent players, but it's a free-to-play MMO so that feels like cheating.) Still, the trend is mostly true: early in the year there's almost always some big co-op hit that busts the doors off Steam. These games are usually pretty inexpensive, especially in comparison to the eye-watering $70 price tags of some games these days, and they're often early access, survival-ish, basebuilder-y games…",

The company is seemingly all but ditching the Office name—which it introduced four years before Corsair existed, and which drove more than $30 billion in revenue just last quarter —with a catchy new name: \"Microsoft 365 Copilot app.\" Copilot is, notably, a thing that already exists!

He didn't ask for this, but that's just how it goes when you turn in an S-tier performance in a sequel to one of the most iconic videogames of all time. Alas, the durability of that performance does not mean that we'll be seeing Toufexis-as-Jensen returning anytime soon. After wrapping up 2025 with a message on X outlining projects he has coming in 2026, including Marathon and three others that are under NDA, he concluded,\"No Deus Ex, because the people in charge are psychopaths.\" (Image credit: Elias Toufexis (Twitter)) That's a bold statement, but one I'm not inclined to argue with: If you can finish Jensen's Deus Ex trilogy, and choose not to, what other conclusion am I expected to reach?

We've all been there. Late on Sunday, reports started emerging on Reddit and elsewhere that players were unable to login to League of Legends, with their attempts stalling out indefinitely at the game's initial loading screen. While Riot shortly said it was \"looking into the issue,\" players quickly narrowed in on the root of the problem after checking the client's error logs: Windows was rejecting its connection attempts because of an expired SSL certificate. SSL—short for \"Secure Sockets Layer\"—is a security protocol for establishing encrypted connections between a server and client.

What I can tell you is that it \"delivers ultra-fast wireless performance,\" alongside lower power consumption, and the flexibility of hot swappable switches. So, if TMR isn't your thing for whatever reason, the MX 8.2 will allow you to swap between both magnetic and mechanical switches. If you stick with the Cherry MK Crystal Magnetic switches, you'll enjoy \"ultra-smooth linear input with 0.01 mm precision\" alongside an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate. The wireless, tenkeyless MX 8.2 Pro TMR keyboard will cost about $250 when it releases on January 29, though it won't be lonely in the lineup for long. The K5 Pro TMR keyboard—a follow-up to the wired Cherry Xtrfy K5V2 from 2024—will drop later in the Spring.

Rosen was a former US airman stationed in post-war Japan and the Far East, and after his service ended in 1952 stayed in Japan, first founding the company Rosen Enterprises, Inc., which sold Japanese art in the US market and also had a successful business in photo booths called Photorama. In 1957, the company's focus changed to importing coin-operated amusement machines to Japan, which proved lucrative, and establishing its own venues. \"Right off the bat, the machines were tremendously successful,\" Rosen told Next Generation Magazine in 1996 . \"At this point, I was opening up arcades with these shooting and hunting games throughout Japan, and we were fortunate… I don’t know [how many we had], but by the time I left, there wasn’t a city in Japan that didn’t have one of our arcades.\" In 1965, Rosen Enterprises merged with Nihon Goraku Bussan, which used Sega as a brand name for coin-op machines: the name comes from a contra…",

You need to layer up properly so all your pointy metal armour bits don't hurt your delicates. It could have been even more persnickety. In a chat with PC Gamer , Warhorse co-founder and KCD2 executive producer Martin Klima recalled a scrapped system that would have seen Henry gain and lose weight depending on how much you ate, preventing you from wearing certain items of clothing and armour. \"Currently in the game as we released it, all men wear the same clothes you do… basically, you can put on anything that you find,\" Klima said. But earlier in development, Warhorse toyed around with a different system: \"Some NPCs would be fat and some would be thin, and then the clothing they wear would be either too large or too small for you.\" But ol' Henry would be malleable. If you found a great set of armour you weren't sufficiently husky enough to wear, you'd have been able to chow down to reach the right size. \"When you…",

However, WD decided to separate from Sandisk ; WD would focus on the lucrative HDD business and Sandisk would become its own entity focused on SSDs. The split happened in February last year. It all went off without a hitch; the only problem being the branding. Sandisk, now independent from WD, had the company's name on most of its best products. Today, that all changes.

Asus reports the glasses can cover 95% of the \"human focus area\" with its 57-degree field of view. The one spec that gives me pause here is the FHD resolution (aka 1080p). With a screen being so close to your eyes and intended to give such a huge screen digital experience, this feels very low given how large the virtual screen will be. Still, the display is impressive, with the Xreal R1 AR being the first 240 Hz gaming glasses. A Micro-OLED screen should look mighty impressive, but font fringing is a worry on OLED panels, especially at lower resolutions. These are designed as gaming glasses, so that should be less of a worry, but it's certainly something I'd consider if I wanted to use them in a productivity capacity too.

At launch, that math held true. In three days, Monster Hunter Wilds had sold a triumphant 8 million copies—the fastest-selling launch in Capcom's history. 10 months later, the story of Monster Hunter Wilds has a very different tone. On Steam, its review rating hangs at a middling Mixed, having intermittently plunged to Mostly Negative when updates either neglect or worsen the game's profound performance issues. By July, its sales had collapsed—and after news broke that it had gone from 10 million launch sales to less than 500,000 in a quarter, Capcom's stock price plummeted alongside.

Regardless, here's one more bit of evidence for the 'Howard doesn't hate Obsidian' pile: in a chat with Game Informer (via GamesRadar ), Howard said that, when it came to a non-Bethesda studio making a Fallout game, it was Obsidian or bust. \"They were the only choice,\" said Howard. \"They had done something similar with Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well.\" In 2004, Obsidian put out Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2—a follow-up to BioWare's KOTOR 1 that more than a few people (myself included) came to regard as their favourite of the two games, and that despite the fact Obsidian had barely over a year to make the whole thing. So Bethesda knew Obsid…",

      "body": "There are two obvious reasons you could already be excited for Code Vein 2. One: it's a soulslike made in-house by the publisher of FromSoftware's Dark Souls series. Two: anime melodrama. If you love characters scream-crying through their emotional beats more than reading FromSoft flavor text like \"If the soul is the source of all life, then what distinguishes the humanity we hold within ourselves?\" , this action RPG holds great potential for you. I can't say that the anime Dark Souls angle grabbed me in the three hours or so I spent playing it at a preview event in December, but Code Vein 2 is also, depending on how you choose to play it, Dark Souls But You Have a Gun. Now that's got some pull. It feels like wielding a forbidden instrument. Illicit. I'm harnessing a power typically reserved for comedic punctuation. Do I just think that because I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark at a young age and instantly formed a new personality the moment Indiana Jones Smith & Wesson'd that sword guy into oblivion? Who can say. Anyway: Playing Dark Souls With a Gun rocks. I spent a good chunk of my time with Code Vein ignoring the timing of my multi-hit combos and reading attack patterns by sta…",

The DLC is split into levels in which you need to find clues and solve puzzles, but its open-world nature means you can explore at your own pace too. You're able to venture through Mirkwood forest, the Starcourt Mall, and even throw yourself into the Upside Down if you're feeling brave. It's actually scarier than the Nether, especially when you've got a pack of demogorgons on your tail. As you make your way around the world and solve the various puzzles tucked away, the world will \"evolve\" to give you new areas to explore as well. To coincide with the setting, most of Stranger Things' iconic characters are available to play as too, and each comes with unique abilities to help you make your way through Hawkins.

The game got a poor reception, including from us. Steven Messner scored the game 55% in his Anthem review and called it \"deeply flawed and frequently frustrating,\" though very pretty indeed (I am often described the same way). BioWare pledged to \"reinvent\" the game around a year after release until another year later in 2021, when EA execs said 'Actually, hold that thought', and cancelled development entirely. Despite all that, the game's servers have been up and running for all that time; the world's slim supply of Anthem-heads have been able to get their fill for years. But it's all about to come to an end. Anthem's servers are set to finally judder to a halt on January 12, 2026, putting an end to any way to play the game. That's seven days from now, if you've still not wrapped your head around what year it is. Which, hey, same. BioWare had its fair share of con…",

For the unfamiliar, Troika is a very 'realheads know' sort of studio: Its games presaged the similarly buggy (and occasionally unfinished) early work by Obsidian, which was also founded by ex-Interplay devs. But, also like Obsidian, Troika's games were ambitious, imaginative, and unforgettable. They had strong word-of-mouth reputations on RPG forums, and all three of its games have received essential fan patches and laudatory reappraisals, with the Big Kahuna arguably being the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines . \"We had a lot of feature ideas, we did not edit ourselves at all, and we were a small team,\" Cain summarized at the beginning of the video. \"Every time Troika went to make a game, whether it was Arcanum, or Temple of Elemental Evil, or Bloodlines, there were just so many things we wanted to do.

Scattered throughout New Vegas' Honest Hearts expansion, Clark's journals are an autobiographical account of the bombs falling and his experiences (and eventual death) in the world that followed. It includes the loss of his family, his adventures as a solo survivalist, and run-ins with various others, like a group of children that he becomes caretaker for in his old age, unwittingly laying the groundwork for a new tribal culture you meet in the present day, the Sorrows. For New Vegas lead writer John Gonzalez, it was one of the only things he wrote for the RPG's lauded series of DLCs before leaving Obsidian in March 2011 to work on Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.
