Casablanca Studios will open in Miami as a “creative sanctuary,” with plans to open outposts in other parts of the world as well, says Ricky Montaner. “There’s so much music and content we’re competing with, that it’s vital in some way to try to have a platform for artists who will surround themselves with peers who will elevate their craft,” he adds. “It’s like a little oasis. We’re doubling down on our creative process. That’s why we bought this studio.

Syncing won’t resume automatically — you need to reconnect your Google account to Movies Anywhere to restore it. The fix closes the last major fallout from the feud, which had already been resolved elsewhere weeks ago. If you use Movies Anywhere to keep your movie purchases in one place, there’s some low-key good news to end the week. After disappearing during YouTube TV and Disney’s contract spat , syncing for Google Play and YouTube purchases is finally working again. As reported by 9to5Google , Google Play and YouTube have now been restored as Movies Anywhere partners. Disney owns Movies Anywhere, and the service dropped Google support during the dispute, resulting in a break in cross-platform syncing. Now that Google has been reinstated, things are mostly back to normal. You just have to take one extra step.",

      "body": "AI artist Xania Monet returned Friday (Dec. 19) with her prickly &#8220;Say My Name With Respect&#8221; single, which claps back at critics like Kehlani , who previously slammed AI artists. Monet, who is operated by writer Telisha &#8220;Nikki&#8221; Jones, is looking for the industry to put some respect on her name and not undermine the powerful art that&#8217;s being released into the world, regardless of its approach. &#8220;Funny how you went to the media first/ Talking about my pen like you know my work/ You don&#8217;t know the nights I cried to write/ Or how many songs healed somebody&#8217;s life/ You say I ain&#8217;t real/ You say I don&#8217;t create/ But your voice shake a little every time you create because deep down you know I&#8217;m destined to shine,&#8221; Monet sings. Monet doesn&#8217;t list Kehlani by name, but appears to be taking aim at the &#8220;Folded&#8221; singer, as well as others who have condemned AI artists. She continues: &#8220;You keep saying I&#8217;m not a real artist, right/ But somehow my songs still change somebody&#8217;s night/ People say my lyrics saved them, that&#8217;s real art.&#8221; It will be interesting to see if and how Kehlani …",

NBCUniversal’s streaming video service, Peacock, offers two tiers of subscriptions. After its steepest price hike a few months ago, the ad-supported Premium tier costs $10.99 per month, while you will have to shell out $16.99 per month for the ad-free Premium Plus tier. As if the existing ads in the Premium tier weren’t enough, Peacock has the bright idea to add even more ads to the Premium tier — this time, showing ads right when the app starts up.

Instead of Windows 11 or an ROG Ally-style Xbox interface, this Legion Go 2 version is expected to run SteamOS. SteamOS is likely to improve users’ experience with better power management and a console-like interface. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 gaming handheld was first showcased at the CES 2025 conference, but it didn’t make it to the market as late as the October. So, an upgraded version makes little sense. However, Lenovo may be looking to expand options for potential buyers by offering another variant that runs SteamOS instead of Windows. As per a recent leak, Lenovo may be gearing up to reveal this new variant of the Legion Go 2 at CES 2026, exactly a year after the first reveal. Windows Latest says the step to introduce a new variant stems from the unoptimized Windows experience on the small screen. While Lenovo had the option to choose the Xbox full-screen experience (FSE) , as did with the 2025 variants of ASUS ROG Ally and Ally X. However, it appears to have gone with SteamOS for its advantages, including lower hardware requirements, better power management,…",

YouTube says the change is meant to make it more straightforward to tune Shorts recommendations. Along with almost every other element of the platform, YouTube has been tinkering with how feedback works on Shorts for a while. The experimenting continues, and some viewers are about to see another switch-up. This time, YouTube is testing a new take on the Dislike button that affects both its placement and exact meaning. In a post on the Google Support forums , YouTube says it’s experimenting with folding “Dislike” and “Not interested” into a single thumbs-down option for Shorts. Rather than sitting on the main video UI, the button will now be tucked away behind the three-dot menu. Depending on the test group, it may appear as “Dislike” or “Not interested,” but the action itself remains the same.",

While some issues with open earbuds are unavoidable (such as the lack of noise canceling), HUAWEI has taken major strides when it comes to comfort, sound quality, and features.

It had to be, owing to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5’s improved architecture , OnePlus’ abiding emphasis on internal cooling tech, the new highly responsive 165Hz display, and the brand’s general fidelity to users who expect more than just the basics from their phones. But my colleagues’ initial reactions to the phone shook that conviction. In their initial testing, my colleague Robert Triggs found the new phone running at nearly scorching temperatures . That’s a good thing if you’re near the North Pole, helping Santa pack gifts for kids. But for the rest of us mere mortals, those temperatures — I’m talking about nearly 53°C (127°F) on the surface, were bothersome, and especially harrowing for mobile gamers who intend to use it for several dozen minutes, if not hours, holding the phone in their hands while fragging foes in leading FPS games.",

Compared to existing foldables, it may be wider than Google’s Pixel Fold, but not as thin as the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Apple is expected to announce the device by late 2026, though shipments might not stabilize until mid-to-late 2027 due to production ramp-up issues. The Galaxy Z TriFold is attracting all the proper attention this year, but Samsung has its task cut out for next year. While the Galaxy Z Fold 7 impressed, and the Fold 8 is expected to continue that streak, Apple is also rumored to launch the iPhone Fold, giving stiff competition to Samsung’s foldables. We’ve heard about the iPhone Fold’s unconventional shape, and new leaks are now shedding more light on the iPhone Fold’s exact dimensions and its potential design.

OnePlus’s R series has typically provided great options in the mid-tier/value flagship space, but the 15R breaks that trend. It removes OnePlus’s iconic alert slider for an annoying AI button, has downgraded cameras compared to the 13R, and no wireless charging — all on top of a steep $700 price tag. The OnePlus 15R isn’t the worst Android phone you can buy, but it’s also incredibly easy to find something much better — even from OnePlus itself.

For a lot of people, the appeal is that you can open the Camera app, tap the shutter, and trust Google’s software to do the rest. That ease of use is one of the Pixel’s biggest selling points, but it also means many features find themselves sitting unnoticed in the background. Earlier this month, my colleague Joe Maring dug into that side of the Pixel Camera app, highlighting seven hidden settings that many owners either forget about or never discover in the first place. The list covered everything from composition tools and focus controls to storage and Motion Photo tweaks, all aimed at showing just how much flexibility is hidden beneath the surface.",

With One UI 8.5 rolling out in beta , Samsung has quietly improved one of its most popular customization tools , Theme Park from the Good Lock suite, with a major update that gives Galaxy owners more creative control than ever. One of the most noticeable changes is how themes are organized. You can now bookmark your favorite creations using a heart icon, as spotted by SamMobile . This might seem minor, but it really helps if you often switch up your phone’s look using Good Lock .

The issue predominantly affects phones in the Pixel 7, 8, and 9 series across the stable and beta channels, though a few Samsung users are affected too. The issue has apparently existed for over a year, and Google has acknowledged it, but hasn’t fixed it. The Google Pixel devices are intended to be a role model for the ideal Android experience. Ironically, however, these devices, including the premium ones, suffer from far more bugs than most other popular Android devices. While most of them, thankfully, get fixed in a matter of weeks , there has been one protracted bug that hasn’t been resolved in over a year. And it’s driving people up the wall. For months now, owners of several Google Pixel phones have been experiencing issues connecting to the head unit in their cars. According to several reports, Pixel phones don’t automatically connect to the car’s units immediately and require users to do it manually. For some, manual connections also fail, and the workaround they have figured out is to turn the media audio toggle…",

For the first eight minutes after liftoff, the crew and their indicator nearby will still be pushed into their seats by gravity, and the force of the climb into space. When the main engines of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s core stage cut off, gravity’s restraints are lifted, but the crew will still be strapped safely into their seats – their zero gravity indicator’s ability to float will provide proof that they’ve made it into space. Artemis II marks the first time that the public has had a hand in creating a crew’s mascot. The Mission Over…",

Emoji play a core role in how people communicate online, allowing us to express ourselves with playful images and symbols rather than just text. New emoji arrive each year to expand our expressive range, and to ensure they appear correctly on everyone’s device, regardless of the platform, they are codified in the Unicode standard. The latest version — Unicode 17.0 — dropped on September 9, 2025, introducing over 160 new characters.

It’s a system-level component, meaning it can’t be uninstalled without root access and can only be toggled off. Even when disabled, the system reportedly attempts to restart Lock Glimpse every few seconds, resulting in unnecessary background activity. Nothing’s latest software experiment is turning into an unexpected headache, and it’s testing the patience of some of the brand’s loyal fans. The trouble is with Lock Glimpse, a lock-screen feature in Nothing OS 4.0 , which started as an optional addition but is now sparking real concern about battery life. Lock Glimpse first appeared in beta builds of Nothing OS 4.0 . On paper, it sounds harmless enough. Nothing frames it as a discovery-focused lock screen experience. You wake your phone and see rotating images paired with short headlines, each linking out to a web article. The pitch is that it adds variety and context. The reality, according to many users , is that it feels a lot like ads wearing a minimalist disguise.",

Google rolled out Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 earlier today for Tensor-powered Pixel devices. While it includes expected features like flashlight brightness controls and navigation button order settings — changes we anticipated from recent Android Canary releases — it also brought a surprise: the return of the expandable location indicator in the status bar.

The plan was to license Horizon OS to hardware partners, with ASUS and Lenovo initially confirmed as two. Meta now says those plans are on pause as the company focuses more on its own hardware efforts. It feels like mobile tech is at an inflection point right now when it comes to all things extended reality (XR). While the idea behind glasses-based augmented reality and mixed reality has been around for years, it’s only recently that the hardware and software powering these solutions have matured to the point where all this actually feels like it might just be commercially viable. As we look forward to what’s next from Google and Android XR , it sounds like Meta’s own XR plans are going a bit sideways. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Previously, users could only share audio from the specific Chrome tab they were presenting. Google Meet can now share your system audio, allowing meeting participants to hear sound from any app or source on your computer. Google Meet is a free and simple video conferencing program, but it’s not without limitations. The software supports sharing Google Chrome tabs, system windows, and even the presenter’s entire screen to create a collaborative experience with meeting participants. However, Google Meet was historically less versatile when it came to sharing system audio. In an update, Google is tweaking Meet to handle audio sharing better, adding support for sharing device audio with the group. While presenting a specific app window or your computer’s entire screen, Meet can now share your device’s complete system audio with meeting participants. This makes it possible for users to play audio from an app that’s running in the background during a Meet call. Before the change, Google Meet users had to present a specific tab to share audio from a site with the group.",

A few years ago, taking an Android phone into an area without cell service meant you were completely cut off — unable to text friends, family, or even emergency services. Today, however, you wouldn’t be so disconnected thanks to satellite connectivity , a feature that links your phone directly to satellites orbiting Earth. Google introduced platform support for satellite connectivity in last year’s Android release, though the feature was initially limited to emergency messaging. The technology has advanced significantly since then, however, paving the way for features like WhatsApp calling and live location sharing even without cellular coverage.",

The deal reflects Verizon’s rent-instead-of-own strategy, following its exit from tower ownership last year, which has become the industry norm for all major US carriers. Network improvements are likely to be real but fairly incremental, with limited short-term impact for most users. Earlier this year, T-Mobile formally acquired US Cellular’s customer base , retail footprint, and some of its spectrum in the process. That said, the company behind US Mobile continues as Array. Going forward, Array’s core business is to license its massive collection of former US Cellular towers to other companies, with T-Mobile signing a deal in May to use over 2,000 of them to boost its own coverage. Now it seems Verizon is making a deal of its own , committing to the use of over 4,400 new towers in the deal. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The tablet is priced at $399.99 in the US, with pre-orders open now and general sales starting December 26, 2025. Alongside the OnePlus 15R , OnePlus is also refreshing its budget Android tablet offering with the new OnePlus Pad Go 2 , which features a larger display, a newer processor, additional software updates, and more. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 features a 12.1-inch 2.8K (2,800 x 1,980 resolution) 120Hz LCD with Dolby Vision support, offering a peak brightness of 900 nits. The display size is larger than its predecessor, but the Pad Go 2 retains the squarish 7:5 aspect ratio for a book-like layout.

The new OnePlus 15R tries to keep that streak going, playing to OnePlus’s strengths of performance and battery life while costing less than its flagship sibling, the OnePlus 15. But with a fan-favorite feature gone, OnePlus’ software heading in the wrong direction, and areas like camera quality and wireless charging being left on the back burner, it makes this year’s OnePlus R phone a much less attractive option — especially with another price increase that pushes it all the way up to $700.",

Available globally from today, it gives advanced users a way to host Homey locally on devices like a Raspberry Pi, NAS , or small home server, rather than relying on dedicated Homey hardware or cloud-only control.

When you want to share something on your screen but don’t want to — or can’t — get a link to the content, you can just take a screenshot . If what you’re trying to capture is too long to fit on screen, you can take a scrolling screenshot to capture more than what the display shows.

That backdrop is what led us to ask you a blunt question about your expectations in a recent opinion piece by my colleague Rita. Specifically, we wanted to know if you think that the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will underperform their competitors in 2026.

My welcome mat says “Welcome-ish” for a reason! Of course, I live in a town where occasionally I get door-to-door reps for various things. I usually just ignore them until they go away, but when someone with an AT&amp;T logo on their shirt showed up at my door, I decided to answer it just to see how the experience would go. One of my main areas of focus here at Android Authority is cellular service coverage, so I figured it would be nice to have a better idea of what people are up against anymore. And, oh boy, was this an experience.",

The company has started rolling out a new firmware update for the Galaxy Ring that aims to improve battery stability. Since its launch last year, the Galaxy Ring has been praised for its comfort and how well it works with Galaxy watches and phones, as mentioned in our review. At the same time, battery behavior has been a recurring sore spot. Some users reported that the ring’s charge percentage would drop faster than expected .",

It now uses the same search interface as on every other Android device. Google says the change enables quicker access to AI Mode. For a long time, the unique search interface has been a characteristic part of the Pixel experience. Instead of launching the Google app, as it does on other Android devices, tapping the search bar on Pixel phones has traditionally opened a unique search overlay that also enables searching for apps, local files, and contacts, and offers a shortcut to search the web in a relatively modern interface. Unfortunately, if you liked that interface, you’d be disheartened to know it is going away. Instead of the unique interface, Google is replacing it with the search screen we’re used to seeing on other non-Pixel devices.",
