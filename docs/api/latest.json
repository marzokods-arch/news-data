Some dabbled with the idea of virtual sheriffs, while others took to naming and shaming on Reddit, but now they've taken to using a new tool. The Speranza Watchlist has been circling raider groups for about a week now, as some celebrate finally having a concrete way to report evil players, while others lament that they've been wrongly accused of some heinous crimes: \"Bro, I have 219 reports on an account that I haven't been able to use for the past week.\" (Image credit: Embark) I too had an outrageous bounty levied against me. With an evil rating of A, a certified menace, I'm apparently the worst of the worst. With over 400 reports against my name. Which is ridiculous considering I haven't even encountered 400 people during my time in Arc Raiders. But none of that really matters, because The Speranza Watchlist isn't real.

Stxy: Blades of Greed is now set to launch on February 19, 2026 , a relatively brief pause that will give Cyanide time to \"polish everything up, tweak the bits that need tweaking,\" and ensure that Styx's big comeback lives up to expectations. And what are those expectations? For that we'll throw back to Shaun, PC Gamer's number-one Styx guy, who noted that Master of Shadows and the follow-up Shards of Darkness both earned review scores in the upper 70s, \"which sounds about right.\" Styx is also enough of a headliner to be the marquee guy in our recent quiz about videogame goblins , which reminded me (consider this a freebie answer if you haven't taken it yet) that Styx did not emerge into our world fully formed, but was actually a supporting character in the 201…",

Grivel said when he left Ubisoft in October 2022 that after 11 years at the company, \"it is now time for me to go on a new adventure.\" That adventure, according to his LinkedIn profile, took him immediately to Electronic Arts, where he spent a year and a half working on Battlefield 6 as studio design director at Ridgeline Games. That came to an end when Ridgeline closed in early 2024 as part of major cuts at EA , and so Grivel tripped back to Ubisoft to work briefly on \"an unannounced project in conception phase.\" He left again at the end of 2024 to join Worlds Untold—just in time for that studio to fall victim to major cuts at NetEase . And now he's back where it all began. \"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!\" Grivel wrote on LinkedIn (via GamesRadar ). \"A very special team and project to me.\" If you're hoping that Grivel follo…",

They've already taken things to the next level of in-game photography, such as placing ziplines for aerial tracking shots, filming actions from multiple angles, and using equipment like smoke bombs for special effects. There are some really nice shots across the three short films, and it goes to show just how cinematic Arc Raiders' animations and overall gameplay are, especially when the Arc machines are added into …",

But today's File Explorer tests prove that there's more to it than that—Microsoft simply still has some work to do to make Windows 11 as good as it can (or even should) be. Microsoft is currently testing preloading File Explorer in the latest Insider Preview Build 26220.7271, available on the Dev and Beta channels. Windows Latest took the new improvement out for a spin, and the results are underwhelming at best.

Microsoft is testing loading File Explorer into local memory before you ever need it, so it loads faster when you do. Testing shows that Microsoft has succeeded, but only on paper. (Image credit: Microsoft) Windows Latest ran a bunch of test on a virtual machine limited to 4 GB RAM. Without preloading, launching File Explorer accounted for 32.4 MB of RAM, and enabling the feature nearly doubled RAM usage, bringing it up to 67.4 MB. That's negligible usage, of course, even on …",

      "body": "قال الإسباني بيب جوارديولا مدرب مانشستر سيتي الانجليزي لكرة القدم الإثنين، انه غير مؤكد من موعد عودة لاعب خط الوسط مواطنه رودري إلى الملاعب. وكان رودري الحائز على الكرة الذهبية لافضل لاعب في العالم لعام 2024 غاب في الموسم الماضي عن المستطيل الاخضر لفترة طويلة جراء تعرضه لاصابة في ركبته، كما لم يلعب سوى مرة واحدة وثم لدقائق فقط، بقميص سيتي في مبارياته العشر الاخيرة بسبب مشكلة في العضلات الخلفية لفخذه. ويتجدد غياب ابن الـ 29 عاما بعدما تم استبعاده عن الرحلة إلى فولهام الثلاثاء في المرحلة الرابعة عشرة من الدوري، في حين تحوم الشكوك حول مشاركته في المباراة المقبلة في ملعب الاتحاد أمام سندرلاند السبت المقبل. قال جوارديولا، ردا على سؤال في مؤتمر صحافي الاثنين لم يستمر سوى بضع دقائق، حول إمكانية مشاركة رودري \"لا، ليس بعد\". وعندما سُئل عن إمكانية مشاركته في نهاية الأسبوع، أجاب مدرب برشلونة وبايرن ميونيخ الالماني السابق \"لا أعرف\". كما تحدث جوارديولا عن حارس المرمى الإيطالي جانلويجي دوناروما الذي حصل على بطاقة صفراء للمرة الرابعة في مسيرته القصيرة منذ انضمامه إلى سيتي قادما من باريس سان جرمان الفرنسي في الفوز القاتل على ليدز 3-2 السبت. وكان الألماني دانييل فاركه مدرب ليدز اتهم دوناروما بالتظاهر بالإصابة لايقاف اللعب والسماح لغوارديولا بمنح تعليمات مهمة للاعبيه. وبات الحارس الإيطالي على بُعد …",

Along the way, though, the inevitable topic of AI and what it means for human labour and creativity reared its head. It sounds like Houser isn't quite as starry-eyed about the tech as so many other people who continue to occupy corporate C-suites. Asked if AI is going to lead us to the sunlit uplands so many tech 'visionaries' are promising, Houser is unequivocal: \"I personally don't think it will, because I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it—which is really superficial—the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models.

And before that... you get the picture. But, it seems that AMD is now quietly looking to dethrone its own top chip with a slightly improved version, dubbed the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. The CPU has just appeared on AMD's driver page (spotted by Olrak29 ) with zero fanfare and zero details. Love that for us—we get to speculate a bit. The truth is, we've already had some leaks about the 9850X3D in the last few months, so we have an idea of what to expect, but none of it has come directly from AMD. At least we now know the processor exists, so chances are that the specs are real, but you never know with these leaks. Previously, another Twitter leaker, ch11eddog , said that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D would come with a 120 W TDP, eight cores and 16 threads, 96 MB of L3 cache, and a boost clock speed of 5.6 GHz. That gives it a 400 MHz advantage over the 9800X3D.

Oh, and with that comes the warning that the new AI features are prone to \"hallucinate\" and \"introduce novel security risks.\" As to the details, Microsoft says security flaws include \"cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.\" In other words, you could download, say, a PDF which contains hidden text instructing your Windows agent to execute nefarious tasks. And it might just carry out those instructions. So, surely Microsoft has some mitigations in place? Up to a point. Firstly and mercifully, these new agentic features are not enabled by default. However, once switched on, they're enabled for all users, all the time. They are at least labelled as \"experimental agentic features\", and a warning is delivered during the setup process.

This is especially the case with Baldur's Gate 3, where performers like Neil Newbon and Amelia Tyler have gone on to become evangelists for the game. Speaking with our friends over at GamesRadar during the Golden Joysticks, Karlach's VO, Samantha Béart, says they've noticed this discrepancy first hand: \"There's a weird disconnect between, maybe, developers' attitude towards where we fit in the ecosystem—where we're not actually part of the team—versus the players, who very much see us as the forefront.

Besides, that is, the standard routine of a new realm opening up in the Dream Castle, and needing an extortionate amount of Dreamlight to get there in the first place.

Tactics RPGs about students who fight demonic analogues of small-town problems at night, yet have to balance that with school and social obligations by day? I'd say sign me up, but even the shorter ones take 80+ hours and the longer ones demand well over 100. I tried Metaphor: ReFantazio and gave up in boredom during the second dungeon. They are not games that respect your time. So Demonschool, which seems to basically be a Persona game in all but name and the fact it can be wrapped in under 40 hours, should have been an instant slam-dunk. Our reviewer, Mollie Taylor, liked it well enough , praising the intricacy of its battle system and the wit of its dialogue, but had an important reservation. At launch, it suffered from \"some wonkily-threaded narrative beats\" and \"some general visual bugs and systems that felt a little obtuse at times\". No problems that couldn't be patched it seems, which made me put it on the \"wait\" pile rather than the \"play immediately\" pile. With every update it shifts a little closer to that second pile, and the latest, which Demonschool developer Necrosoft is calling its second big post-release patch , seeming like a s…",

I mean, I can't draw hands and feet either, but at least I know not to draw four toes on one foot and five toes on the other.

Blue & Blood is an ambitious total conversion mod that reimagines the game from the other side of the law—not as a young gangster clawing his way up, but as a cop teetering on the edge of corruption. The mod drops players into the boots of the LSPD’s most infamous unit, CRASH, in a story that blurs the line between justice and vice. The result is something gritty and unmistakably GTA, and it’s being built by two people: Cascavel, a veteran roleplayer and modder, and giacobbe, a software engineer with a lifelong love for the series. Roleplay roots For Cascavel, Blue & Blood was born out of San Andreas Multiplayer. He spent years on a text-based server called Los Santos Roleplay, crafting characters and stories with hundreds of others in real time. \"That experience made me appreciate strong writing and believable characters,\" he says. That storytelling instinct followed him into modding. Cascavel began with pedestrian models, launched a successful Blender tutorial series, and explored total conversions like Frost…",

You know, those song soundbites that involuntarily bury into your brain before vomiting their way out of your mouth for hours, days, or even weeks on end. There was that time I got really into humming the Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare every time I accomplished a task. Or when I couldn't stop walking around singing just the drop from Tekken 7's Infinite Azure stage. My current one? The first verse in Heartbeat, Heartbreak from Persona 4. Or singing the chorus while hitting the Narukami Shuffle to the best of my ability. I'm still working on that part, my shuffle game is weak. Almost all of us will experience an earworm at some point in our lives, and there's a good chance at least one of them will be a song from a videogame. I mean, next to regular ol' music, videogame soundtracks are some of the stuff we'll listen to…",

But take solace—there are thousands of people just like you who wouldn't trade those virtual Swiss skylines for anything. In fact, it seems like there are more than ever. Over 13 years after its release in 2012, Euro Truck Simulator 2 has surpassed its all-time concurrent player count peak on Steam, according to SteamDB . At time of writing, an hour has passed since the game hit a new all-time peak of 72,678, and while the number is flickering a bit, it's rare to see such a seemingly niche game so hoppin' over a decade after it came out. There are a few apparent reasons for this. The game just got two new DLCs on the same day: Nordic Horizons , which takes players through northern Scandinavia, and Forest Machinery , a smaller-scall add-on that piles on doodads like wood chippers and mulchers.

Then there's supernatural seafaring adventure Davy x Jones . Originally launched in August, Davy x Jones is a roguelike FPS where you play a headless freebooter named Jones, battling through the underworld in first-person combat while accompanied by a chatty skull companion named Davy. Davy x Jones enjoyed a pleasant, if quiet reception on its early access release, with players praising its imagination but criticising its rough edges. But the shooter has just had its hull thoroughly careened, with a massive update expanding and overhauling its fundamentals in significant ways. Chiefly, the update doubles Davy x Jones' scope by adding a second mode of play, letting players helm a \"living ship\" as they explore the underworld in third-person sailing. Said ship is actually a hybrid with a wooden hull and a cosmic space whale. I…",

A striking example was recently provided by Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto, who revealed that Master Chief's suit design was revised nine times before Bungie settled on his final look. Lehto, who is an alumnus of Ohio's Kent State University, was speaking to Kent State Magazine (via GamesRadar ) about the impact his education had on his future career. During that interview, he chatted about the process Bungie went through to design Master Chief's armour. \"The creation of the Master Chief is something that I went through so many wringers to try to find the right look, the right feel, the right stature for such a character,\" Lehto explained. \"We tried a lot of things.\" Some of these initial designs have made it to the Internet, such as Shi Kai Wang's early concept for Master Chief. Apparently, Bungie felt those early designs were too stylised, and Lehto's later concept borrowed elements from the M1 Abrams tank and the lines of an Apache helicopter.

Favourably compared to Katana Zero , it received near-universal praise for its crisp pixel art, Bionic Commando-esque platforming challenges, and surprisingly involved storyline. Two years on from Sanabi's launch, Wonder Potion has now released an expansion for Sanabi. Titled Sanabi: A Haunted Day , it’s a prequel spinoff in which you play as a different character from the main game. Also, it's completely free. Sanabi: A Haunted Day puts players in the role of Major Song, who has a minor role in the base game. As mentioned, the DLC takes place before the events of Sanabi, with Song investigating a sprawling robots scrapyard which the DLC's Steam page says is plagued by \"strange phenomena\". Alongside the new location, Song has a completely different moveset from the base game's protagonist. While she lacks a grappling hook, she is nonetheless capable of \"agile aerial manoeuvres\" such as an infinitely replenishable mid-air jump.

They were a perfect encapsulation of Warhammer, grim but also a bit silly, heroic but also earthy. Eventually they'd get their own novels, but first they appeared in a compilation of short stories called Trollslayer. Honestly, I don't think the Felix and Gotrek stories worked as well once they were expanded out to novel length. With a few exceptions, almost all of their best adventures were short stories like those collected in Trollslayer, which is why I'm interested in the special edition Games Workshop recently announced .

He said as much in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel yesterday—the same channel where he routinely shares insights and commentary from his entire body of gamedev work, including everything from the original Fallout to Wildstar and The Outer Worlds. The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't. To summarize, his argument is thus: canon is \"whatever the owner of the IP says it is,\" an individual's interpretation is personal and freeform and therefore \"you can't be wrong,\" and authorial intent is another matter altogether that usually differs from team member to team member, and may even diverge greatly from canon.

While chatting about the nuts and bolts of their in-development Grand Theft Auto project, modders-turned developers Cascavel and giacobbe cited Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper, Mafia, and Schedule I as sources of inspiration for their standalone game. Although details are scarce, the pair describe it as a systems-driven game with a strong narrative core—something that blends the charm and loop-based depth of life-simulators with the grit and atmosphere of crime dramas. \"We’re being tight-lipped for now,\" says giacobbe. \"We started overly ambitious—it would’ve taken us years. So we’ve refined the idea into something more realistic and achievable. Right now, we’re focused on building our MVP gameloop while balancing our modding commitments.\" The duo cite Schedule I in particular, a solo-developed breakout hit, as a major motivator. \"It wasn’t the financial success that inspired us,\" adds Cascavel, \"but the f…",

No, I'm not talking about Unreal, I'm talking about Half-Life: Element 64 , a fresh mod that released a demo today on Steam . After spending some time with that demo, I can say it's more of an asset flip into an original game with new levels and music than a mod merely tweaking Half-Life's mechanics. There's no train ride, no resonance cascade, nothing waiting for you in the test chamberrr ; it drops you into a level select hub not unlike Quake, HEV suit and all, and from there you'll be blasting away head crabs and vortigaunts in a matter of seconds.

At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth.

After buying a roll of nano tape, however, I've adopted a revolutionary philosophy: My many organizational sins can't hurt me if I simply stick them to the bottom of my desk where I can't see them. Is it a form of voluntary self-delusion? Maybe. But nano tape is the only thing granting my workspace some semblance of order. I know, I know—tape isn't everyone's idea of an exciting PC gaming deal, but what's a better gift to buy yourself than peace? Especially when peace is just $9? We're curating all the Cyber Monday PC gaming deals right here Unlike your traditional, run-of-the-mill, loserly tapes, nano…",

But Desert Strike, and its sequel Jungle Strike, were rare exceptions, and I distinctly recall us pad swapping as we picked our way through the latter's fiercely tricky night mission. It seems plenty of other people are nostalgic for EA's twin-stick chopper, as a spiritual successor to the Strike series is making waves on Steam (must be the rotor wash). Released last week, Cleared Hot has racked up a 98% 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating out of 1,200 reviews —not bad considering it's an early access title based on a genre that had its heyday more than 30 years ago. The main appeal of Cleared Hot is how it takes the template laid down by EA and upgrades the action with modern spectacle. Now, when your hellfire missiles thud into tanks and structure, they burst in a glorious, physics-powered shower of debris.
