The most popular ones simply won't work when Midnight arrives as part of Blizzard's plan to level the playing field for all players. Unsurprisingly, this hasn't gone over well with everyone. Some addon developers have called it quits , while others have expressed concerns over Blizzard's new rules. Professional world first raiders aren't sure what their jobs are going to look like in the next year and more casual players are worried their favorite classes are being over-simplified as a result. In a lengthy post about this new era of addon support, game director Ion Hazzikostas explains why any of this is happening now, what exactly is changing, and how things will move forward as the Midnight beta continues. \"We take none of this lightly,\" he says, adding that Blizzard has \"never designed [encounters] FOR addons,\" but it has \"inevitably had to design AROUND them for the past several expansions.\" Basically the problem was this: When a boss marks five players with ticking bombs, addons can just tell those people where…",

For more than four years, Romero has been politely but pointedly correcting every inaccurate memory and anecdote Petersen's shared on Twitter (now X) from his time working at id Software. Nearly each tweet begins with some variation of \"Hi Sandy, hope you're doing well\" before nuking the original statement from orbit. Petersen joined id during the development of Doom in 1993, working on several of the game's levels and designing more for Doom 2. He also worked on Quake before leaving the studio in mid-1997, about a year after Romero's exit. That makes for a good bit of overlap, though of course Romero was with id from the beginning, having co-founded the studio in 1991. Romero, notably, has talked about having hyperthymesia , which he credits for giving him a vivid memory. I don't know if his recall is perfect , but each time Petersen trots out an id…",

The only series in the style that's truly won my heart is Age of Wonders, the fourth of which you can try for free this weekend until Monday, Nov. 17. If you're not familiar, Age of Wonders marries the deep strategy of 4X to turn-based tactical RPG gameplay. It also grounds a lot of the map-painting in intuitive, tangible roleplay scenarios: You don't play a faceless nation, but a customizable ruler and culture, gathering magical artifacts, schools of magic, skills, and provinces as you explore the world. You can play as anything from classic fantasy dwarfs to gothic, power-mad molemen, and territory is won with turn-based battles made up of your custom troops.

No reason for the postponement or trading halt was provided, but these things are rarely the result of good news. They often arise from events like unexpected major news announcements or regulatory problems that can have the potential to trigger panic selling. (Image credit: Ubisoft) There's no sign that's the case here, but Ubisoft is in a unique and precarious situation right now. The company's share price is in the toilet, and it recently entered into a deal with Tencent to establish a new \"creative house\" called Vantage Studios that will assume control of the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six properties.

Those doubts were a distant memory by the end of the second episode, thankfully, and the rest of the eight-episode run only served to cement this as a brilliant piece of interactive TV. I am genuinely sad that it's over and desperately hoping for a second season. Turning on the charm (Image credit: AdHoc Studio) Dispatch has rizz for days. With such a large cast, many of whom have more experience streaming than voice acting, like Jacksepticeye and MoistCr1TiKaL. I expected there to be at least a couple of duds, but nope!

This week, as it boasts record-breaking quarterly profits, the Korean publisher has followed that strategic shift by launching a voluntary resignation program for its domestic employees, according to Business Korea reporting (via Automaton ). The program, announced internally, offers substantial buyouts for domestic Krafton employees based on their length of employment at the publisher. Severance packages range from 6 months' salary for employees with one year or less of service to 36 months' salary for employees who've worked at Krafton for over 11 years. The voluntary resignation program follows a November 4 earnings call in which Krafton announced a record quarterly profit of 1.052 trillion won ($717 million).

This week I've been: pondering whether this Expedition project is actually worth it right now. I finally finished my Expedition project in Arc Raiders, \"Now I can actually play the game\" as I saw one Reddit-user aptly state. It was a pretty long process, considering I started it immediately at level 20 and now I'm level 33. It saw me desperately rummaging through apartments in Dam Battlegrounds praying for a Humidifier drop, farming Leapers with Wolfpack grenades, and searching high and low for Cooling Fans. The surprise fifth and final stage practically emptied my 256 item vault to fulfil its conditions, dumping crafting mats, weapons, gadgets, and trinkets en masse into my Expedition pod to reach its value capacities. Disregarding the four previous stages, you need a grand total of $830,000 worth of various loot items, and that's a whole heap of stuff . And it doesn't even count towards the loot value at the end of the season that determines how many of the five bonus skill points you get on your next character. For those that …",

The game is also included in Ubisoft's Game Pass-esque subscription on the platform, but it's an odd value proposition when the studio's games so frequently end up on such steep discounts. The promotion is angled to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Ubisoft Connect, as shared in a blog post Monday. I mostly know the app as the cobweb-covered desktop icon I occasionally use to launch Steep or a Rayman game, or as the benign growth I find tacked onto any Ubisoft-published games I try to launch from Steam (a platform Ubisoft has unsuccessfully tried to jump ship from before), but I suppose I can't complain about the cross-play and cross-save.

It was a rip-the-band-aid-off opening for a presentation that quickly moved on to what Ghost Ship's doing in the meantime: launching a new season for Deep Rock Galactic, its first since 2024, while it continues work on the roguelite spin-off for next year. \"At Ghost Ship Games we've realized we can't have our cake and eat it at the same time, and do everything ourselves,\" Pedersen said. That's why the studio is following the Dead Cells playbook, partnering with another developer nearby in Copenhagen to create season six, which will come to Deep Rock early next year. The big draw for the new season is a spooky biome littered with the giant bones of ancient beasts, with a new enemy species to go with it. There are three types of Ossirans lurking in the Ossuary Depths, including a flying pest called the Scrab, the Pit Jaw, a \"living bear trap\" that can grab you if you walk over it, and the Bone Collector, which will pop up in other biomes.

But apart from the over-abundance of still-somehow-funny 'GabeCube' comments, what I've seen perhaps the most is people questioning why the Steam Machine has just 8 GB of VRAM. It's not a new phenomenon; people have been complaining about graphics cards having just 8 GB of VRAM for years now. The problem really rose to the forefront with the RTX 4060 Ti , which initially launched with just 8 GB of VRAM to the chagrin of some . Nvidia then released a 16 GB version with a much higher price tag, which people also didn't like—many seemed to just want a 16 GB version with the 8 GB's price tag. The complaint is that 8 GB of VRAM isn't enough for gaming in 2025 in many cases. And this much is true for at least some games to run at higher settings, such as Hogwarts Legacy and The Last of Us Part 1 —this was resolved in The Last of Us Part 2 , though. Even when games don't seem to be trying to use more than 8 GB of VRAM, that might be because they're choosing not to stream as many or higher-re…",

Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: I'm considering whether I'd like a cube under my TV while hopping on a flight to help with the next PC Gaming Show, which airs December 4 . In 2017, I wrote a big report about why Steam Machines failed to take off, and the main thing Valve's hardware partners told me was that SteamOS just wasn't ready for the big leagues. The custom Linux distribution didn't support enough hardware or games, and only super-nerds had much enthusiasm for ditching Windows, especially as Windows 8 was being replaced by the much better-liked Windows 10. As a result, the original Steam Machines were never taken seriously as an alternative to desktop PCs or consoles like the Xbox One. Manufacturers started putting Windows on them to get them out the door. \"Nobody …",

Reddit user akia_Gecko has also uploaded a video to YouTube showing those log file writes by the AMD graphics driver in response to minor window movements. And it certainly looks pretty scary. As akia_Gecko says, \"every time you move a window or resize a window on your desktop, those files get modified multiple (hundreds!) of times.\" Of course, SSDs can be read almost indefinitely, but writes cause actual wear. Hammer an SSD with enough writes, and you'll kill it eventually. However, it does not necessarily follow that AMD's graphics driver will obliterate your SSD.

For a second, it appeared on Dbrand's site a day after the Steam Machine announcement, with zero details other than a sign up form for email notifications and a smattering of \"coming 2026\" text, which suggests it's an idea someone might have come up with on the spot. However, The Shortcut says that Dbrand has already emailed about the case , and it really does appear to be in the works: \"After yesterday’s announcement of the Steam Machine, we asked our Industrial Design team the only sensible question: Can we turn this thing into a real-life Companion Cube?\" said Dbrand. \"Yes.

There are many more reasons for that than Marathon, of course: Destiny 2 is in a big slump , while the studio has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs , and its CEO recently departed . But the mood music around Marathon is not great and with Concord in the rear-view mirror, one of the biggest live service flops in the industry's history, you sense a certain caution in the Sony executive suite. Marathon was announced with a (fantastic) trailer in 2023, but was indefinitely delayed earlier this year after \"passionate\" feedback. There was also, for good measure, a plagiarism scandal . Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao now says the company is \"fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule\" which means by March 2026: \"We will assume that we will launch this within this [financial] year, and that is …",

If you jumped at the opportunity to start customising your character with accessories like I did, then you'll be thrilled to hear this too. Both DLCs will add five remix tracks and ten accessories each to the game. The first will arrive this month, adding five Dance Dance Remixes to the game alongside its mystery accessories. And, outside of the DLC content, all players will receive a cosplay set for Saki Hanami from Idolm@ster, which is potentially one of the greatest outfits I've seen yet in Katamari. I hope this also means we can expect more cosplays in the future, as I'd probably sell my soul for a Miku outfit. With that said, this outfit in particular is only available for the Prince, so you won't be able to dress any cousin up in full cosplay.

Tune in via YouTube , Twitch , Steam , X , Bilibili —pretty much anywhere you can watch a video. How we selected the nominees Once a year, we send a messenger to The Council's secret lair and present them with a list containing the PC Gamer staff's top unreleased games. This is a long list of 100 games we're excited about. Some had fantastic teaser trailers, some have more Steam wishlists than ever believed possible, while yet more have flown under the radar of all but our most eagle-eyed writers and editors, and some are from fantastic developers who've already released our favourite games. That long list awaits you below, and you may notice there are fewer than 100 games on it this year. …",

Last of all, you need to find a Ventilation Shaft with a power switch where you can start the electricity flowing again.

I've bought almost every Meta headset to date, and unboxing the first one in the Summer of 2020 is definitely a highlight of my VR journey so far. However, Meta's dominance in the market is soured somewhat by Meta itself. Meta AI remains the unwanted present that just keeps on giving, the \" legendary misadventure \" of the metaverse is a multibillion-dollar digital eyesore, and, of course, it has laid off tens of thousands of employees in the process. And this all makes me feel that, frankly, Meta is too comfortable. The Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S are fantastic bits of hardware, but the closest device I've found to its dominance is the Pico 4 Ultra . Even then, Pico's hardware isn't available in the US and mostly just apes Meta, with very similar specs. Even if the Pico 4 Ultra were to take off and steal back that oh-so coveted market share from Meta, Pico's parent company, Bytedance, is just as data hungry, making it perhaps not the competitor one would want. Valve is a multibillion-dollar company too, but it stays in its lane more and seems content as a corporate entity to just se…",

And that's not going to happen next year or the year after that. It's probably going to be more than that.\" Two years on, Valve is still happy to say it plans a new second-gen Deck.

The game's sequel was released on PS5 earlier this year , with the inevitable PC version yet to be given a release date, while two film adaptations— one live action , one animated —are in the works. Now Hideo Kojima has announced yet another Death Stranding tie-in is being developed for Disney+, and this time it's an anime. Death Stranding Isolations is the working title for the anime, which is due on Disney+ in 2027. Side note: every time the name is mentioned the press release puts \"(Working Title)\" after it, so I hope it's clear this is a working title. Hideo Kojima will act as executive producer on the series while Takayuki Sano, who has a list of anime credits longer than Kojima's Hollywood phonebook, is on directorial duties. The lovely art that accompanied the announcement is by Ilya Kuvshinov (Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045). The anime tells a distinct story within the universe, following a young man and woman on adventure and told through a \"traditional, hand-drawn 2D animation style\" by \"some of Japan’s top animation talent at E&H production\".

Understandably, the idea of having to play through multiple iterations of a game to fully complete it was intimidating, and many people I talked to just didn't have the time for it. Aside from offering to play it through for them so they could just sit back and watch or promising that it didn't feel like a slog when you're actually embroiled in the story of Silent Hill f there wasn't a whole lot I could do to convince them, until now.

The long strap version has also been priced at $230 , a figure that has drawn much ire and ridicule from the online community.

While contributing to the community's efforts in unlocking the map is the main goal, of course, it's not selfish to consider the fact that you also earn Merits for donating materials. Merits are an event currency that you'll be able to spend on a new reward track in the next phase of the community event, once the Stella Montis map is actually available. Not only did these donations not put a single dent in my stash, but I also didn't even have to play the game; I just clicked 45 times on the main menu. The crucial part is that the maximum amount of Merits you can earn (during this phase, at least) is 900, so you'll have completed your personal contribution after donating 225 materials. In other words, just 45 clicks, or 46 if you're counting the button to open the event page.

It was only when I got to try a Steam Deck for the first time that I realised Steam Machines weren't dead at all and now they're back again entirely. So what went wrong the first time, and will the new ones fare any better? To fully understand the significance of the Steam Machine's rebirth, you need to go back to the year 2012. This period is important because it's when Microsoft released Windows 8 , a version of the PC operating system that was supposed to be an OS for all devices, but mostly just succeeded at pissing people off. Developed over four years, Windows 8 wasn't just a mild tweak of Windows 7, with a fancy new GUI slapped on top.

Curiously, Steel Frontiers is confirmed for PC, Android, and iOS but not PS5, though as Guerilla Games' Jan-Bart van Beek mentions in the video embedded above, it has been \"built specifically for mobile\". It's also well worth noting that this NCSoft-developed project is distinct from Horizon Online Project, which is an online spin-off Guerilla Games itself is making. Based on the footage, Steel Frontiers looks pretty good for a mobile game, though that depends on whether you think the Horizon series in general looks good. There are few obvious compromises made when it comes to the equally lush and decrepit open world, and the mechanical beasties look as ornate as usual. Some loose things I can glean from the video footage: there are mounts, both flyable and grounded. You can leap from your mount onto a Tallnec…",

But how well do you know our loyal, four-legged friends? If you saw 10 different dogs from 10 different games, do you think you could tell me their names, or at least the games you know them from? In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a dog, and all you have to do is type in its name. To make things a bit easier, you can guess either the name of the dog or the name of the game . So, if you can't quite remember a dog's name, you can still make a guess about what game they're from. Sink your teeth into this quiz, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

Are you wearing the Ryder skin in its black and orange styling? Well, you might be shot on sight. \"Pro tip. Every time you see someone wearing this specific outfit, do not ask questions, do not bother [talking to] them, do not ask them if they need help,\" YouTuber Onepeg said in an X post over a streamer using the Ryder skin. \"Just f***ing murder them.\" The exact skin in question is Ryder, one of the outfits given away on the first Arc Raiders battle pass. More specifically, it's the orange and black version of the Ryder skin with its helmet goggled off and its headgear toggled on. The supposedly untrustworthy subject might also have goggles. It looks like this: (Image credit: Embark Studios) At first, I was inclined to chalk this up to streamers saying things out loud without worrying about their accuracy, but interestingly, this specific instance of fashion profiling seems to be corroborated by other players and streamers.

It's probably the biggest PC hardware news we'll see in 2025, but Australians can be forgiven if they feel a little unenthused. After all, Valve is famously slow to release its hardware into Australia: the Valve Index took a year, only to be thinly available at some EB Games outlets. Worse, the Steam Deck took more than two years. But never fear: No such antipodean delay is in the cards for Valve's new line-up. Here's confirmation straight from Valve: \"All three products will ship in all the same regions we currently ship Steam Deck (US, CA, UK, EU, AU ) as well as regions covered by Komodo: Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\" None have a specific release date nor price at the moment anywhere in the world, but are targeting early 2026. \"Specific launch timing and pricing to be shared sometime after the first of the year,\" Valve writes. That means for Australians, the Steam Frame, Steam Machine and Steam Controller will all be purchasable directly from Steam at the same time as all those other regions.

Before we entered the building, we were already discussing one of the products yet to be announced, the Steam Frame. For many, this announcement will not come as a complete surprise, as intrepid detectives glean information from even the slightest breadcrumb left by Valve in the months ahead of the launch. This time, a trademark for the name 'Steam Frame' gave away the Deckard project's real name ahead of our visit, but Deckard rumours have been rife for years. Some more accurate than others, but generally not miles off when you piece it all together. But is this some sort of clever scheme by Valve to drum up support or test out the popularity of ideas on dedicated fans? No, apparently not. That's right from the horse's mouth, too, and if you take this as further proof of some sort of grand plan, I have a bridge to sell you. Stood in a room surrounded by Valve engineers that drew the short straw in having to talk to press, I raised the question, how do they feel when someone gets near-definitive proof of something like the Steam Frame early?
