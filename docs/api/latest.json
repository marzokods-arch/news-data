It is in no way merely a cover for me to revisit the topic of PC Gamer's official 2025 GOTY vote which I am definitely not still salty about here in 2026. * According to this very website , Blue Prince is the Best Designed game of 2025. True! But that award reflects that it was the runner-up to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which narrowly beat it for the top game of the year prize. To that result, I say: \"Rigged!!\" Okay, not rigged. But I believe I'll be vindicated by history in declaring this miraculous detective game, designed largely by a single mind over the course of eight years , as the game of 2025. I fought hard for Blue Prince to get PC Gamer's top GOTY honor, because I really don't think there's anything else like it out there.

But in a new interview with GamesIndustry , Kiciński and GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski said there's room for it to flourish and find success, even in a marketplace so utterly dominated by Steam. The core of the strategy seems simple enough: Throwing hands with Steam is a bad idea, so don't do it. \"Steam is obviously a Goliath,\" said Gołębiewski. \"So for any company to try to tackle Steam is a very hard battle. We've seen Discord launch their store, we've seen Epic Games launch their store—and thanks to the lawsuit with Apple, we know how much it has cost them to launch this battle against Steam. \"So the fact that GOG is expanding, developing, and still kicking, I think it's a testament to the fact that GOG really has its space on the market with its mission of making games live forever.\" Gołębiewski said Steam is \"doing an awe…",

Originally planned to roll out in December, the DIY microtransactions didn't end up going live until January 9 , immediately after which things started going sideways. Steal the Brainrot, one of the most popular third-party games on Fortnite, moved very quickly to take advantage of the new policy once it went alive, and it was not especially gentle in its approach.

Now, breaking ground on a new fab to actually manufacture memory chips might be a bit beyond the wit of even the most enthusiastic DIY'er. But where there's a will... The modder, who goes by the handle VIK-on, used a pair of 16 GB DDR5 laptop SODIMMs as a starting point. The next step was to source a compatible PCB with the aim of combining all 32 GB onto a single homebrew DIMM. Reportedly, the total cost of the build was $218, about a third of the going rate in Russia for a 32 GB DDR5 stick. Nice. VIK-on also looked into using even cheaper 8 GB sticks to source memory chips, but it seems the chip packaging raises problems when it comes to creating 32 GB sticks.

Moore said: \"Our viewpoint is that we are trying to help consumers around the world.

And we want to make sure that, as a company, we help fulfill that TAM as well.\" \"This is not a Micron issue, it's an industry issue, where us and our peers or our competitors are all rushing to service these segments as much as we can, and there's just not enough supply to go around … Memory manufacturers are scrambling to build newer production lines, yet constraints of the process eventually forces them to push the timelines ahead by several quarters, which means that for the average consumer, the DRAM shortages could persist for quite some time now, or at lea…",

It'll really depend on which direction Larian swings the needle—D&D's action economy has a heavy reliance on crowd control, given you only have one action per turn (alongside a bonus action and movement).

Anyway, over the weekend (Sunday, to be exact), Steam broached the 42 million concurrent user limit, hitting a new record of 42,042,778 users online at the same time (per SteamDB ). Not a bad way to kick off the year, if you're a titanic videogame storefront. Which, yes, on the one hand, is hardly a surprise. Steam's growth has been relentless and undaunted for ages.

Huang reflects on the AI naysayers in a recent interview with No Priors (via Business Insider ). The Nvidia leaders and No Priors hosts Elad Gil and Sarah Guo venture down a lot of paths during the nearly 80-minute conversation, including what happens to jobs under an AI future, and when we might see a 'god AI'. One key point is the various narratives around the ethics of the machine learning tech. Huang argues the world of the future is one where AI leads to more jobs: \"People say, 'gosh, all of these robots that we're talking about. It's going to take away jobs'. As we know very clearly, we don't have enough factory workers. Our economy is actually limited by the number of factory workers we have.\" Huang therefore argues that robotics will lead to a huge repair industry, and that will naturally lead to more jobs.

I'm certainly the guilty party here. I've made my mates cosplay as sock puppet lawyers , run around wizard towers as magical minions , and try to contain SCPs like the dog and peanut (iykyk). But one of the best pitches I've ever made to the group chat has to be Peak , not just because it's a fantastic co-op game but because it's fantastic value for money. (Image credit: Aggro Crab, Landfall) \"We had this joke of, like, how much is a game really?” co-creator of Peak, Nick Kaman, says in an interview with Game File . \"In a player’s mind, what does it mean to spend five bucks? Well, that’s five bucks. But six bucks? Well, that’s still five bucks. Four bucks is also kind of five bucks, three bucks is two bucks.

As we understand it, somebody at the CES show rifled through the driver files of a laptop demo'ing Intel's new Core Ultra Series 3 chip and found references to the increasingly mythical G31 GPU . Someone downloaded the graphics driver for a Panther Lake laptop model and discovered that the folders include firmware for the BMG-G31Driver link: https://ftp[dot]hp[dot]com/pub/softpaq/sp165501-166000/sp165849.exe pic.twitter.com/S0Jr8v1AN2 January 10, 2026 We have, of course, seen what feels like countless references to B770 or G31 over the past year or so . But the card stubbornly refuses to make an official appearance. It could be that Intel has never been planning to release such a GPU for the consumer market, and all of these rumours and leaks are for nought. But if the B770 is real, why didn't it appear at CES? There are a number of theories. One possible factor is the ongoing memory price crisis, and Intel ma…",

Even then Anthem had its diehards, and the patches and updates that followed addressed some of its more significant flaws. Not enough to save it unfortunately, but enough to guarantee a small but dedicated community of Freelancers who have suited up and returned to Fort Tarsis for the final day before EA pulls the plug on Anthem for good . Our Lauren Morton is one of the players who logged on to say goodbye. \"It's not empty,\" she says, \"but it is quiet.\" There are Twitch streamers running missions until the end, and high-level veterans \"waving and jumping and emoting\" around the Launch Bay.

But there is one specific bird sound, a tremolo warble that I know from Age of Empires, which I seem to hear more than anything else. Mostly it's in pop songs. It plays repeatedly over the outro of Anaconda by Nicki Minaj , and you can hear it in Babylon by Lady Gaga . It's in Pacific State by 808 State and Animals Beat by Skrillex . It's in multiple tracks by Aphex Twin. I think it's in Michael Jackson's Thriller, but that might be a different sample of the same call, and I'm halfway convinced it's been used in heavily processed form in Lana Del Rey's Million Dollar Man . According to Who Sampled , it's in at least 190(!) tracks. Basically, anywhere someone wants things to sound a bit wild and maybe like you're in the jungle, this is the go-to bird cry.

It seems Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse are keen to maintain that momentum in 2026. In a Steam update , Hooded Horse's CEO Tim Bender provided a detailed rundown of what's coming to the management sim this year. The most immediate planned change is a new upgrade level for the Burgage Plot—Manor Lords' basic homestead that can be expanded and tailored to a variety of uses. Burgage plots currently have three upgrade levels, but Slavic Magic is adding a new level, which exists between 2 and 3. \"Its goal is to more smoothly bridge the gap between early and late-game housing\", Bender explains.

It's actually the free chocolate you get from Valve for making all that money on its digital sales platform. As Gamesradar noted in its report on this, there's a video on YouTube where games marketing consultant Chris Zukowski talks about Valve's coveted \"chocolate tier\": a special class of studios that, once they get up to around $800,000 in annual revenue, receive a box of fancy chocolates as a gift from Valve at the end of the year. That Gamesradar article mentions an interview Game File (readers may encounter a paywall) conducted with Peak developer Aggro Crab. Co-founder Nick Kaman confirmed Aggro Crab has been itching to join the chocolate-chowing inner circle since it released Another Crab's Treasure , its most successful game before Peak. The team didn't receive a gift from Valve in 2024 despite pulling in the right amount of cash from that game, which stung; when Kaman emailed Valve about it, he got an apology. The team's unrest was compounded by the fact that Aggro Crab shares a building with Mega Crit, the Slay the Spire developer—as you m…",

That being said, I have bad news, #SlorkNation: Valve has melted Slork's wet, slippery body into Sunday dinner. Let me back up. Slork was a hero concept first accessible via console commands in Deadlock's private test. He was later added to the hero labs, a feature where characters with placeholder art could be used to queue up for normal games during scheduled hours, assuming you had a certain number of games under your belt. At this point, Slork had been renamed to the decidedly less hilarious Fathom. Deadlock has spent the last year shifting forms like the MOBA version of an Animorph, and the hero labs mode was removed as the game became increasingly polished and all play was subsumed into a single ranked queue. Four of the eight hero labs characters were added to Deadlock's core roster permanently. The others, including Fathom, were simply removed. That brings us to now, a moment wherein the Deadlock community …",

The prevailing theory in that thread is swimming, which makes sense; both Original Sin games and Baldur's Gate 3 all funnel players onto a beach through their intros, and shores flanked by inaccessible water has sort of become the studio's signature the same way Bethesda seems fixated on starting each Elder Scrolls game in a prison.

This problem came to a head last year, with Riot promising to cut back on supplementary utility powers to reorient Valorant back around gunplay. This initiative is set to continue through 2026, with Valorant's latest patch introducing a new gun as Riot promises more extensive weapon reworks in the future. That new gun is called the Bandit, a semiautomatic pistol designed to fill the gap between the silenced Ghost and Valorant's high-powered revolver, the Sheriff. The Bandit gives players a higher rate of fire than the Sheriff and superior damage compared to the Ghost, able to deal instant kills on headshots against lightly armoured players. Riot believes this should add some extra spice to those early, pistol-heavy rounds.
