Speaking to The Register , one of the co-authors of the paper, university professor Miklós Koren, said: \"We know that developers have adopted vibe coding very fast.

For AMD Ryzen processors, you honestly wouldn't need anything better, and although Intel's chips can handle faster DRAM, they'll still be just as happy with a kit like that. Now, the same set of memory costs $480 at Amazon , and should you want RGB lighting or DRAM from Corsair or G.Skill, then you'll be handing over a lot more cash. You can pay less, of course, as this 32 GB kit from PUSkill is $300 at Amazon , for instance. No, I've never heard of that brand before, either, but one reason why it's so much cheaper is its speed and timings.

Mechborn is definitely that, inserting cards and turn-based fights into a world of giant mechs battling kaiju.

With music that has more than a touch of the Pacific Rim theme to it, and surreal monsters right out of a '90s anime, it wears its influences on its sleeve—but it does them justice. A roguelike deckbuilder lives or dies on its mechanics, however, and heading into a run with an early build of the game, I was at first worried Mechborn might be style over substance. The very easy early battles make the game seem formulaic—faced with a deck full of 5 value attacks and shield cards, a choice of a starting item that grants a passive bonus, and very familiar buffs (strength adds to my damage, you say?), it can feel like Slay the Spire in…",

AMD is smart enough to understand this, to understand the way the cosy old days tug at the heart strings of PC gamers, especially in a difficult time where the past we yearn for is fully rose-tinted. So we shouldn't be surprised to see the red team taking us back a decade with its thoroughly nostalgic new CPU, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. It's taking us back to a different time when one processor company was so dominant it could stand to release barely iterative versions of its top processors because it had precisely zero true competition. Welcome to AMD's very own Skylake era, an era where Intel's gaming processors are so far off the pace AMD can replace the best gaming CPU over a year down the line with a new chip and not actually make any changes beyond a clock speed tweak. Yes, we've waited 15 months for an upgrade to the old Ryzen 7 9800X3D and all we get is a 400 MHz overclock.

      "body": "2025 was a bumper year for Korean memory specialist SK Hynix. In fact, the latest financial results show it was the company's best year ever . Do I even have to explain why? OK, it's AI, of course . But first, the bald numbers. SK Hynix raked in 97 trillion KRW in revenues in 2025. That's about $67 billion dollars in old money. Profits, meanwhile, hit $33 billion, giving the company stellar operating margins of 49%. Compared to 2024, revenues climbed by 47%. However, profits slightly more than doubled. Long story short, SK Hynix didn't just sell more stuff. It made more money on every sale. This does not exactly come as a surprise. The prices of pretty much all memory-related products have been spiralling upwards of late. But the cost of producing memory products has surely not increased as much. The result, pretty obviously from SK Hynix's published results, is that a lot more money is being made on each memory chip. So, apart from the obvious upside for SK Hynix's shareholders, is there any good news here? The company did talk about the investments it is making in production capacity. \"Having successfully completed the preparation stages to mass produce HBM4 – for the first time…",

Despite how many trips you've undoubtedly taken here, it doesn't make scoping out locations to find cover spots any easier. Similar to the With a View and Prime Specimen quests, you'll also have to nab an item to complete Combat Recon. In this case, it's a Spotter Relay, which is better than having to take down the Bombardier itself, I suppose. If you don't already have one, just look for the Bombardier's recon drones at Marano Park, Plaza Rosa, or Parking Garage. Below, I'll go over the exact locations you need to visit to complete the Combat Recon quest. Take note that you can do these in any order, so head to whichever area you're closest to when you spawn in.

That doesn't mean World of Warcraft isn't going to keep trying, mind you. The Worldsoul Saga is one of Blizzard's most ambitious moves yet—committing to a three-expansion story arc where everything's been more-or-less planned out, giving them the chance to tell larger, bigger-reaching narratives. Narratives where someone is gonna bite the dust at some point, most likely. That's per an interview by PCG contributor Heather Newman, written for issue 420 of our magazine that'll be hitting shelves soon. Heather spoke to both game director Ion Hazzikostas and design director Maria Hamilton about Midnight , the midpoint of the Worldsoul Saga—and both WoW leads emphasised that the team is winding up for some big swings. \"There will be important characters that do not survive the trilogy.

I'm flying, I'm flying.\" TheBurntPeanut new meta from r/ArcRaiders It's a pretty funny clip, and honestly, on the tamer side of things I've seen The Burnt Peanut do in Arc Raiders, but it does demonstrate how the snap hook still has some movement tech for players to take advantage of.

Though the company may have just won a very important customer: Nvidia. According to Digitimes , citing supply chain sources, Nvidia has signed on with Intel Foundry to manufacture some parts of its forthcoming Feynman chips. Nvidia will reportedly use Intel for only some of its chips, namely the non-core bits. It's said to be choosing between Intel Foundry's 18A or 14A process nodes, dependent on whether Intel has high enough yields to reliably produce enough chips on the latter. TSMC, the top dog in Taiwan, will still be leading the charge with the most important silicon, the GPU itself. Most likely on its A16 process node. Feynman is the next major architecture on from Rubin and Rubin Ultra, which is set to arrive from 2028. Revealed at GTC last year , named after physicist Richard Feynman, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said very little about the tech specs of the new chip, but a slide behind him titled \"Nvidia Paves Road to Gigawatt AI Factories\" depicted the chip paired with a Vera CPU, IO, and network chip…",

Currently, just three keyboards are supported: Razer Huntsman V3 Pro , Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Mini, and Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8 kHz. In fact, although it could possibly be some peculiarity of my setup, it's in such a beta state that I couldn't get it working with the Huntsman V3 Pro. I installed the firmware for the keyboard through the separate firmware updater, and it was working with traditional Synapse, but no luck with Synapse Web; it just says \"no compatible devices found.\" It's not a problem with my browser, either, because Corsair's web hub works for me, and that seems to use the same WebHID protocol. YMMV here, though. Once the wrinkles get ironed out and hopefully more devices are added, it should be a massive boon for any Razer users who don't want to deal with what, at times, can feel like local bloatware.

Inscape was a dab hand at sicko-friendly adventures in other words, which can probably be attributed to its proximity with the film and music worlds (it was funded by HBO and Warner Music Group).

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. In the 1980s and early 1990s if you wanted a videogame with a decently written story, adventure games were the only place to find them. Back then RPGs were mostly dungeon crawls, or full of olde worlde thee-and-thou guff. Immersive sims didn't exist. Visual novels were rarely translated into English. Other genres would give you a paragraph of text and a pat on the back, then send you on your way. Because point-and-click adventures evolved out of text adventures they brought some of text's wordiness with them. When you wanted to adapt a book to a videogame, whether it was The Hobbit or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, adventure games were the way to do it. Studios like Infocom, LucasArts, and Sierra valued characters, settings, and themes more than anyone else. Of course to talk to those characters, explore those settings, and understand those themes first you'd have to solve the puzzles. Adventure games were infamous for gating progress with puzzles that mad…",

Mom's advice before she expires: \"Don't think of them as human beings, think of them as Americans.\" That's all Steph needs to hear before throat-slashing her way across the border and making her way to Las Vegas where she runs into Cooper Howard and an unconscious Hank MacLean. I guess when Hank woke up he admired her cutthroat (literally) attitude and made her one of Bud's Buds, which secured her a cryopod in the Vault. Alas, things are not going great for Steph in the present. She's getting a lot of pushback from Overseer Betty of Vault 33, and even worse, from her soon-to-be husband, Chet, who she didn't even bother informing about their impending wedding.

There's also a sweet new mount, the Ladybug Buggy, \"a heavy-duty, tank-style mount equipped with a pressurized water cannon\" that can blast enemies and rinse away Tang.

According to publisher No More Robots, Valve needed to know more about this orgy. In fact, Valve needed to see this orgy. For reasons . \"Up until a few days ago, it was unclear if we were actually going to be allowed to launch Earth Must Die on Steam, as Valve had told us that they were 'unable to verify' the context of the alien orgy,\" says the publisher. \"We were required to record and send footage of said orgy for their verification.\" Yes, yes, verification and context.

Highguard 's gone from one controversy to another since its announcement at The Game Awards, from its awkward reveal to the developers being weirdly silent until launch . A not-insignificant number of people immediately wrote it off, calling it dead on arrival—the next Concord , if you will. Unsurprisingly, this, frankly, unjustified hatred of the very concept of Highguard being a game that exists has gone on to plague its launch. Despite pulling in nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch, it's currently sitting at an incredibly low 33% 'mostly negative' reviews. If you've ever played a truly terrible game, a real 33%, then you'd know Highguard is far from that . I can understand why people have been so quick to judge—Highguard is an awkward hodgepodge of genres that was poorly unveiled, and a sharp departure from the developer's penchant for movement shooters. I, for one, wish he had a spiritual successor to Titanfall, and Highguard isn't that. However, Highguard deserves its fair s…",

I'm sorry to tell you that up until yesterday, Fallout: New Vegas has been unforgivably bad. The dirt-worst. This is, of course, because up until yesterday New Vegas had absolutely no bespoke sneaking animation for its canine companion Rex. Unlike the game's human companions, whenever the player dropped into a crouchwalk while accompanied by Rex, the daft mutt would simply… remain standing, plodding along behind you like you were on a jolly in the park and not on a stealth mission of immense importance. No longer. Thanks to a modder named Wombat , Rex's crippling leg-bone issues are a thing of the past. Once you've got Dog Sneak Animations installed, dropping into a crouch (so long as you're out of combat) will have your pooch friend join you, shuffling along the floor flat on his legs like he's sidling up to you to say sorry for eating the sofa cushions. Spiritual leaders are calling it the thing that might finally unite humanity. It is, frankly, rather adorable, and a great entry in that list of mods that fix things you literally n…",

That studio's Warhammer project now lies in the unreleased MMO graveyard, but there is perhaps a silver lining for fans of the genre: Emmert has returned to his old job as CEO of Cryptic Studios, the creator of D&D MMO Neverwinter, Star Trek Online, and Champions Online. On a call with PC Gamer ahead of the announcement, Emmert said that there's no hard feelings between him and NetEase over the Jackalyptic closure—\"strategies change, and I totally get it\"—but that he was \"down in the dumps\" until he got the call asking him to come back to Cryptic as CEO. \"I've been on cloud nine ever since, and it was just meant to be, I think,\" Emmert said about his homecoming. Cryptic, which Emmert co-founded 26 years ago and previously led as CEO from 2011 to 2016, has itself only survived the 2020s by the skin of its teeth. In 2021, Cryptic wound up in the hands of Embracer Group, the holding company notorious for aggressively acquiring dozens of game studios and then doing its best impression of a malfunctioning cartoon contraption with b…",

Digitimes claims that Samsung is planning on more than doubling the price of its NAND chips in the first quarter of this year, \"amid tightening supply and surging demand driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence applications.\" The site further says that, \"SK Hynix has implemented NAND price increases of a similar magnitude, while Sandisk has previously been reported to be planning a 100% NAND price hike in 2026.\" That means three of the biggest players in NAND chips for SSDs all plan to double their prices, or thereabouts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Digitimes also notes that Samsung recently reported very strong financial results, with revenues up by over 22% to roughly $65 billion for the final quarter of 2025.
