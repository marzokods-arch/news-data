Today, attention turned to next week's Renegades launch, in the form of a live stream breaking down what to expect from the Star Wars-themed expansion. Although I wrote previously that I had no interest in cosplaying as Darth Vader , I have warmed up to the idea of injecting some Star Wars flavour in the form of blaster weapons, some quasi-Jedi on Sith beef, and of course an ersatz lightsaber. Still, there are plenty in what remains of the community with doubts about the wisdom of smushing two sci-fi franchises together. I found it reassuring to hear the game's narrative director Alison Lührs admit that the first thing the Bungie team asked when they sat down with LucasFilm in San Francisco was: 'What's the bad version of this?'\" I guess it made sense to get the image of Jar Jar Binks hurling a Nova Bomb out of the way early.

Some grumbled about a lack of depth and incentive to keep returning to the dungeon again and again, and seven years later developer Digital Sun is ready to show us what it’s learned from those criticisms. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is now available in early access on Steam. I spent several hours with it over the past week, and it already feels like a more focused and refined version of the original. The premise remains unchanged: you play as Will, a shopkeep-slash-dungeoneer who is looking to turn his spoils into cold hard cash. The core loop involves diving into randomized dungeons, fighting the monsters there, filling your backpack with loot, selling it for a tidy profit, and doing it all again. Inventory management itself is a puzzle, as items interact with each other in your backpack, forcing you to think carefully about how you use the limited space.

It encourages players to get on the move by listening to episodic post-apocalyptic stories, interval training while actively 'running from zombies,' and supplies rewards from workout sessions to upgrade their survival base. Alderman co-created the app and wrote its years' worth of voice-acted, episodic stories that have amassed over 10 million users since 2012.

Troubled projects include Saudi Arabia's ambitious (some may say preposterous) city construction project Neom , with its plans for a 105 mile, glass-walled city called \"The Line\" being massively scaled back .

You can find Thomas in everything from Hogwarts Legacy to Elden Ring , but it all began with a 2013 Skyrim mod that replaced all dragons with the resplendent blue engine, as well as adding sound effects from the show. That Skyrim mod was down to game developer and modder Trainwiz (and friends), who notes in his Bluesky bio that \"Mattel is out to kill me.\" This is because toy giant Mattel owns the rights to the Thomas the Tank Engine characters, and doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humour about Thomas mods. Thus, we arrive at a new frontier for Thomas-based heroics. Trainwiz has popped up with a new mod for Morrowind that \"replaces cliff racers with Thomas the Tank Engine.\" Cliff racers are flying creatures that appear all around the Vvardenfell region of Morrowind, and occasionally swarm the player. The reason that you can now get got by countless flying Thomases? Take it away Trainwiz: \"I am incapable of learning lessons whenever it involves corporations, because I fundamentally do not view toy company CEOs or media CEOs as people.\" Expanding on this thought on t…",

Bits like whipping a fish out of the water so you can quick-scope it in midair with a bolt-action rifle for bonus XP. The description on the How to Fish Steam listing doesn't do it justice: \"You and your friends are out drinking and boating. You crash into a small island where you have to fish using everything from fishing rods to assault rifles,\" it explains. \"Sell your catch, earn money, buy better fishing gear, and defeat boss fishes to unlock new islands and finally make it back home.\" We've been living in a post- Ridiculous Fishing world of absurdist angling for years.

The Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition launched on November 10 as an all-encompassing collection of DLC and add-ons, but a related update to Fallout 4's Creation Club menu rolled out for everyone who owns the game and caused issues with certain existing mods. Shortly after tanking Fallout 4's \"very positive\" review average on Steam, Bethesda said it was investigating reports of new bugs, performance issues, and crashes introduced with the Creations Menu Update that went out alongside the Anniversary Edition . The studio issued a hotfix on November 17 for its biggest troublemaker, Fallout 4's Creations Menu, and shared plans for more on November 24, followed by another update sometime in December. Bethesda made good on some performance fixes last Friday, on November 21, when it published a follow up Steam blog with patch notes to address stability and crash issues. Though that's not the fix some modding diehards want, with threads on Reddit from players who sound like they'd rather the update just not exist to begin with. And …",

Now? Well, kind of the same thing again. As captured by the good folk at Posta Entretenimiento , Cox was recently asked how he felt about his Game Awards nomination for best performance, and almost immediately disavowed 95% of the credit. \"I'm thrilled for this nomination,\" said Cox. \"I've said this before, and I think it's important to say that there's an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla, who did almost all of the motion capture for that role, in that game.\" What bearing does that have on Cox's TGA nom? \"So, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him.\" Which is really quite charming, and in an industry where so much vital mocap work ends up becoming kind of invisible—we all know Geralt's voice actor Doug Cockle, but far fewer of us could name Maciej Kwiatkowski, who does his mocap—it's definitely an important point to make.

Which is precisely what a new variant of known malware ClickFix has been caught doing: Tricking users into thinking that an innocent Windows Update requires them to paste a malicious command into the Run window (via Bleeping Computer ). Researchers at security services provider Huntress have detailed the novel new method in a blog post , and it's quite the feat of social engineering. Essentially, a browser window containing a full-screen version of what looks to be a Windows Update screen launches, with the familiar blue background (although with a suspicious-looking font). After the update is \"complete\", the last step prompts the user to hold the Windows key and R, opening a Run instance.

Quantic Dream's new MOBA Spellcasters Chronicles did have the leg up in that I had to play it to write this. I've been excited to dive in since my first small glimpse of the action, and all it took was a game-and-a-half to fully implant itself into my brain.

Taking control of a spellcaster, I started with a limited number of summonable grunts and abilities, both things I'd build into as time went on and I levelled up during the match. Every character can also sprint along the ground or fly in the sky for an unlimited amount of time, making it easy to get a good grasp of the battlefield.

That's according to CNBC , as the news outlet got a look at a presentation reportedly given to employees by Google AI infrastructure chief Amin Vahdat earlier this month. A slide entitled \"AI compute demand\" informed the team that \"Now we must double every six months... the next 1000x in 4-5 years.\" CNBC also reports some direct quotes from the meeting, which was also said to be attended by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai . While Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have been pouring huge sums of money into data center expansion in recent months to boost their own AI serving capabilities, it appears that Google's lofty expansion goals might not be receiving the same budget.

After a limited bit of rearranging of the order, you can decide whether to buy or sit out. Buy, and you'll invest all your money into the stock, let the cards play out, and then sell it—hoping its value at that stage is higher than when you started.

You can find the full changelog on GOG . Also, it's not alone. Alongside the Cold Fear re-release, GOG's adding Ubisoft's 2012 action-adventure game I Am Alive to its storefront and lineup of preserved titles. That game has gotten a spit-polish too, with support for online achievements, cloud saves, high refresh rates, modern controllers, and various bugfixes and such.

A lengthy piece about a $4,000 laptop, brimming with hardware, glowing with accolades and triumphs on its legendary performance and impressive build quality. Yet on my first bout with the Gen 10, it left me sorely disappointed, more so because of my own hubris and oversight than because of the laptop itself. The thing is, I didn't know it then, I didn't understand what it was capable of, and after multiple weeks of testing, re-testing, and really getting under the skin of the Legion 9i, I am now a convert. Hands-down, it is, without a doubt, one of the best gaming laptops I've ever had the privilege of playing with. Albeit with a few minor caveats to that glowing recommendation. So, let's start with the specs first, because it's a whole cornucopia of madness depending on which side of that big Atlantic fish-pond you live on. The model I have here for review is the 18IAX10, complete with Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and RTX 5080 16 GB (capped at a beautiful 1…",

Look at those things. \"Ready up with this controller-meets-clog design that reimagines the iconic Xbox controller with fixed buttons and joysticks into the perfect shoe for couch co-op and kicking back,\" goes the Xbox marketing blurb, like it's describing something perfectly normal and not an abrogation of humanity's duty to treat the Earth's fruits with care and respect. The part I find most displeasing, personally, are the analogue sticks, which arise like malignant fungal nodules from the dorsa of both of your feet.

At a time when layoffs abound, projects are cancelled at a moment's notice, and work in the games industry is more difficult to find than ever, designers being able to show potential employers the work they've done is vital. Hence, diligent, accurate crediting is important for any creative's career, as well as just being the decent thing to do. In most cases, a credit is formulated as the developer's name and the nature of their role on the project, whether that's a fixed job title or a specific type of work they contributed on a part-time or freelance basis. But with the credits for Demonschool , developer Necrosoft Games went one step further, adding paragraph-long descriptions for every role on the project. This was highlighted by Necrosoft's design director Brandon Sheffield, who posted an image of some of Demonschool's credit to demonstrate their approach. \"Often you see credits in games where you don't know what the credited developer was actually responsible for.

You know what else scores 4310 points in that test? Nothing. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D ? 3332. The Core i9 14900KS? 3238. The Core Ultra 9 285K ? 3214. When Apple claimed the ARM-based M5 had the best single-core performance in the world, it sure meant it. But can it game? While you used to be able to buy desktop Macs with Radeon cards in them, we haven't seen that for a while, and no M-series processor has yet been paired with any kind of discrete GPU. Apple instead relies on the integrated graphics cores and, for more powerful desktop machines, its ability to literally glue multiple chips together to increase their number, brute-forcing a solution to the problem by throwing more silicon at it.

Today, Ubisoft continued to pretend it never announced the Far Cry series at FX by announcing the Far Cry series at FX. Again. The details of the show are pretty much what we already knew, but this time, there are quotes to go along with them. So, that's something! \"What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo [another FX/Hawley joint] is a variation on a theme,\" said Hawley. Just like the Far Cry games, each season of the show will be \"set in a new setting following a new cast of characters,\" according to Ubisoft. \"Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created,\" Mac said, who will executive produce as well as star in the show (presumably in more than just the …",

I'd actually wondered how Steam Awards nominations would be handled in 2025. Typically it happens during the Steam Autumn Sale, but with Valve moving the Autumn Sale back a couple months to give us a proper break before the Winter Sale hits, that wasn't going to be an option. The answer was obvious in hindsight: Just make a whole other sale and cram it in there, which is exactly what Valve did with Steam's first ever Black Friday Sale . The nomination process for this year's Steam Awards will simplify things for you by listing eligible games you've played in 2025, as well as providing a rundown of \"popular and recommended games\" if you're more interested in being on the winning team than in throwing your support behind something you actually enjoyed.

It's like a coffin on wheels, but without the robust defensive capabilities of wood. It's no surprise that most BF6 players have made a habit of ignoring the LGT entirely by choosing to spawn directly on capture points or even run out of the HQ instead. Renegade_Soviet is not a normal BF6 player. Earlier today on the Battlefield subreddit, he posted a screenshot of something that I'd wager nobody else has seen in the wild: the Mad Max-ified \"Gold Standard\" skin for the LGT jeep, a reward for reaching rank 50 with the vehicle. \"Rank 50 for the death trap, never removing this badge,\" he wrote alongside the image. \"How,\" one commenter, who understood the implication of reaching the maximum level on a vehicle that's more likely to kill you than help you, replied.

Tavern Keeper arrived on Steam in November, but it's been in development for over a decade—and as impressive as the game is, that's a heck of a long development cycle, especially since it's expected to be in early access for at least another 12 months. I spoke last week with Patrick Klug, director and co-founder of Greenheart Games, and asked why the tavern sim took so long to belly up to the bar. \"We have made, like, six versions of this over the last 11 and a half years,\" Klug said, explaining that just the storybook system alone went through \"dozens of versions\" to become what is essentially an \"interactive audiobook\" where players get to make RPG-like dialogue choices while managing their pub. \"When we started, there were no tavern [management] games.

      "body": "The PC is still the center of innovation in gaming, according to Hilmar Veigar Pétursson, CEO of CCP Games, which is known for long-running, esoteric space MMO EVE Online. \"I think most of the innovation in gaming has happened on PC, to some extent on mobile, just because of sheer volume,\" Pétursson told me at EVE Fanfest earlier this year. \"But I don't think we're observing a lot of innovation in mobile right now. I think we're observing a lot of refinement and execution and formula, kind of hardening. On PC, we still see a lot of experimentation.\" While Pétursson allowed that discoverability is a major issue facing PC developers in particular, he appreciates how the general lack of gatekeeping on the platform⁠—a $100 fee on Steam, or just uploading a project to itch.io or elsewhere⁠—means that \"success comes out of very random places,\" and the platform \"remains strong against all odds.\" We at PC Gamer endeavor to forgive, but never forget all the times people declared \"the death of PC gaming,\" and Pétursson concurs: \"The death certificate has been signed several times.\" \"PC seems to be an environment where a lot of these kinds of things just come alive.

That's just too much sale all mush into one month. But if you thought that the shifted Autumn Sale meant no discounts on Steam in late November, boy, were you ever wrong. Because for the first time ever, Valve has capitulated to the gods of e-commerce and is holding its very own Black Friday Sale . Unlike many online retailers, who view Black Friday as one of the most important sell stuff holidays* of the year, Steam's Black Friday Sale is a relatively small affair compared to the seasonal heavyweights: It runs for just one week, and there are no attendant Points Shop freebies or trading cards to earn for hammering through your discovery queue. Which is not to say there aren't some sweet deals on offer, because there are.

Even after the tutorial, it's frustrating trying to actually win a match until you unlock the Scholar profession, which isn't made clear at all. To save you a lot of rematches, this guide explains how to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet by unlocking the Scholar profession, and goes through how Gift of the Gab actually works once you can play it without tears dripping onto your keyboard.

Hashino also discussed how he's gearing up for what sounds like a literal upgrade to the JRPG genre, except there are no patch notes yet.

The ' ghosts of JRPG past, present, and future ' would have switched up the story of A Christmas Carol a bit, and now I'm wondering what that looks like.

This week I've been: clearing out my stash and filling it up just as quickly by engaging in more PvP. I've praised Arc Raiders a lot since launch, perhaps above all else because it's finally an extraction shooter that's forgiving and welcoming for a wider audience, even as a fan of the genre's traditionally hardcore roots. However, there's a degree to which Arc Raiders' obsession with a fair playing field is its own worst enemy, and it unfortunately strikes deep into its core: the gear system just isn't all that exciting. The confusion I've seen from people wondering what they're supposed to do after they've unlocked everything and completed all the quests should have an easy answer: get better loot, kill things, eventually lose it, and do it all over again. But high-end loot isn't a satisfying and rewarding chase. Firstly, the abundance and strength of free loadouts mean there are a lot of players risking literally nothing in PvP match after match, while those bringing in gear have a high chance of losing it all.

Despite being a sicko for both genres, I'd never dare put them together in a single experience—like the two friend groups you very carefully plan individual events for, lest the two opposing sides of your personality collide in a fiery blaze of social faux pas. While marrying two (in my opinion, rather opposing) styles of gameplay is what makes Tower of Fantasy stand out—because it sure is not the incredible Genshin-ness of it all—developer Hotta Studio is trying something new: it's launching what it calls a Warp server on November 25. One that rips the gacha out altogether in favour of bringing it a little closer to a traditional MMO experience.
