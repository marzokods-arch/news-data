Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . Like roughly half of the internet, I am fascinated by Kowloon Walled City . Built on the site of a military fort, the Walled City was a Chinese enclave situated within former British Hong Kong. Its existence was tolerated by Britain provided China made no effort to exercise its jurisdiction. This peculiar legal status left it largely ignored by both nations, and as such it became the site of rapid, unplanned urban development through the latter half of the 20 th Century. At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth. More than 35,000 people lived in an area of six and a half acres, giving it a density ten times that of Earth's most tightly packed cities like Giza and Manila.

While CrossWorlds is stuffed full of references that sweep the blue blur's quarter-century career—tracks that crib from levels featured across the series, callbacks to random fluff dialogue in games of yore, and even a shoutout to the classic Sega arcade rail shooter Galaxy Force 2—you certainly don't need to be storing all of that info up in your noggin to enjoy everything the racer has to offer.

The vast majority of people who play this Geometry Wars -inspired roguelike love it too, as its 97% positive Steam rating attests. But Steam's rapidly revolving release tombola means that making a great game is no guarantee of commercial success. And as Sektori's developer recently explained, the kaleidoscopic schmup is still a long way from making him any money. Reacting to Sektori's launch on Bluesky, former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen said reception to the twin-stick shooter had been \"awesome\" and \"much more than I expected for such a niche thing\". Lahtinen fully appreciates the highly specific appeal of Geometry Wars-style games, likely why Housemarque itself pivoted to making third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros. Now though, Lahtinen says the response to Sektori has given him hope. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. I went into this fully knowing I would never recoup. It would be my calling card, but nothing people would have ever heard of,\" he says. \"But 100+ Steam reviews, 97% positive + ~90 Metacritic is unexpected to say the least.\" Following this, …",

The fallout from its failure was even less savoury, with Build A Rocket Boy's boss Leslie Benzies reportedly blaming the game's failure on 'saboteurs', before the studio laid off more than a hundred employees. Some of those axed designers then accused Build A Rocket Boy of mismanagement and a total lack of direction, claiming that Benzies \"never decided what game he wanted to make\".

We'll be keeping this page updated through Cyber Monday and into Cyber Week, but I don't anticipate things changing overmuch, if I'm honest. 👉 Hand-picking the best Cyber Monday PC gaming deals right here 👈 While gaming PCs, laptops, and components are very susceptible to market forces and supply chains affecting prices, gaming chairs are generally a lot more stable.

Top-end models like the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 are actually going back up in price, and the entry-level sector has such tight profit margins that big savings are unlikely. So it's the mainstream and mid-range models that are the ones to watch out for. The RTX 5060 Ti , RTX 5070 from Nvidia, and the RX 9070 from AMD could all be well worth snapping up this Cyber Monday.

We know prices are only likely to rise, however, so it might well be that the SSD deals over Cyber Monday are as good as it gets for a while. As far as size is concerned, 1 TB is the least amount of storage you want when shopping around for an SSD.

From 1440p beats to higher competitive 1080p panels, all the way to something lush and OLED, there are plenty of different monitors to get your teeth stuck into. Though please don't actually bite your monito. Still, 1440p remains the sweet spot for those of you looking for the best bang for your buck, and we've seen a steady march of excellent contenders released in the last year, so expect to see some good discounts, particularly for models with a larger panel size. 1080p stays as the budget choice, but given the influx of high refresh rate screens, it's safe to say this resolution is sticking around as the…",

There's been no better time to try it than its 15th anniversary, as the original game is going for just $1.19 on Steam . That's the lowest it's ever been, with a price of $5.99 standing as the steepest discount recorded by SteamDB in the last two years: that's a jump from 70% to 94% off. You can also get the bundle with all the games in the series that made it to Steam for a little over $13. Thematically it's somewhere between a high school drama, Saw, and an Agatha Christie novel, with a psychotic teddy bear turning an academy into a prison of murder and mischief. While it is a visual novel, it's more gamey than the genre name perhaps implies: you investigate murders as they happen and try to pin the deed on the right culprit in a stylish minigame, literally \"firing their words back at them\" with metaphorical truth bullets.

Intel used to make chips for Apple, well, Apple used to use Intel CPUs, but those processors were based on x86 architecture—and, I'm sorry to say, were nowhere near as impressive as Apple's own M-series chips.

Apple doesn't seem to be changing its mind where the M-series is concerned, though. This new partnership wouldn't involve switching back to an Intel processor, but rather it'd involve Intel manufacturing Apple M-series chips in its own foundries.

And if that happens, they'll need a cooler, because if there's one thing a good CPU can do, it's run hot. To that end, Noctua has just quietly shared some good news for those who are already on an Intel platform: its coolers will still work with Intel's upcoming LGA1954 socket. The company wrote on its FAQ page that the same coolers that have worked with the LGA1700 (Intel Alder Lake and Raptor Lake), as well as LGA1851 (Intel Arrow Lake), will remain compatible once the next gen rolls around. Noctua products aren't exactly cheap, but they're powerful, which is why we deem the Noctua NH-D15 to be the best CPU air cooler . But it's one pricey beast. It costs $180 on Amazon right now, and Black Friday PC gaming deals seem to have had no impact on its price tag.

So there's some real history there. It's no secret that a Control sequel is in development: Remedy said so back in 2022. Whether Control Resonant is that sequel is an open question, however. The trademark filing covers a lot of ground, from \"computer gaming software\" to \"printed matter\" like books and magazines, television shows, movies, music, clothing, and even, for some reason, \"lanyards for holding keys.\" It's pretty broad, in other words, and the title could be a reference to something other than a new …",

It makes sense—when you're seeing RAM kits sold for twice the price that they used to be sold for, it's hard not to want to wait it out. The Black Friday sales have only highlighted this, when we look back at the offers around Prime Day in July—just over four months ago, remember—we've seen prices rising from $170 for a 64 GB DDR5 kit to at least $600. However, Santos says that if you want to get your upgrades, it's better to act fast. When faced with a question regarding memory shortages that could potentially extend into 2027 (oh, joy) and how to navigate rising prices, Santos said: \"For consumers that are interested in getting a new PC or upgrading their current system’s GPU, SSD or R…",

For those who have been following his channel for a while though, this won't come as much of a surprise. Eight years ago, a video titled \"Why I don't play video games anymore\" was uploaded to the PewDiePie channel, explaining the reasons behind the lack of Let's Play videos. Since then, his channel has adapted into more lifestyle blogging and the occasional hobby vlog. Of course, there are a few games sprinkled in, with the most recent video featuring Geoguessr. But aside from that, it's not the content you would've expected to see ten years ago. There's a good reason for this though, which PewDiePie explains in the November Kjellberg Mail newsletter. He shared, \"Since becoming a dad, everything does get evaluated differently. Every hour has weight now in a way it didn't before. One of the biggest things I decided to drop was videogames.

The disclosure indicates that AI has seeped into a fair chunk of the game, touching \"Background signboard textures, records illustrations, InfoCast videos,\" as well as \"Voices and music.\" Which is a real bummer, if you ask me. The original Let It Die isn't exactly a beloved classic, but it's a strange and unique thing, like so much that comes out of Goichi Suda's Grasshopper Manufacture studio. A very human game, then—a testament to the powers of what voice actor Jennifer English so recently called our \"beautiful, creative, human brains.\" Let It Die: Inferno isn't a Grasshopper Manufacture product, mind you.

Although the company's actual keebs don't rank on our list of the best gaming keyboards , the switches are in a league of their own—or they used to be, at least. However, Cherry seems to have fallen on hard times, with a net loss of $23 million (20.4 million euros) between January and the end of September 2025. This was with a turnover of nearly $82 million (70.7 million euros), leaving the company with more debt than equity. The future of its Peripherals division is also uncertain, and that's why it's hard to predict what will even happen to these keyboards in the future. According to Heise , Cherry is considering selling either its Peripherals division, which includes all its keyboards and mice, or the Digital Health & Solutions division. Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general \"peripherals\" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.

By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs, even its AI-specific GPUs as opposed to its gaming GPUs, are more general purpose in nature. The parallel here is bitcoin mining, which used to be done on graphics cards before a new generation of dedicated mining chips, also ASICs, came along and did the same job much more efficiently.

For instance, it's long been known that Mr. House originally had a second securitron girlfriend named Marilyn—she's on one of the playing cards that came with the collector's edition, and there's a mod to restore her along with the single voice line left in the release version.

A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct.

The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film.

Although long gone, it's far from forgotten, as can be gathered from this Lego Ideas project . Made by lem.designs, the project is a faithful replica of the ZX Sinclair, all made out of Lego bricks. It won't play any of the classics, but it'll definitely fill you with nostalgia. The project comes with a total of 2,130 Lego pieces, and a big part of that will go towards the computer itself. The sleek PC looks almost just like the real thing, including a realistic keyboard with keys you can actually press. The keyboard alone accounts for 100 printed tiles, with stuff you're unlikely to find on keyboards of today, including \"GOTO,\" \"GOSUB,\" \"LOAD,\" and \"RUN.\" In the very corner of the ZX Spectrum, you'll find rainbow stripes, just like on the real thing. (Image credit: lem.designs/LEGO Ideas ) Of course, the ZX Spectrum wouldn't have happened without the man, the myth, the legend, the late Sir Clive Sinclair himself. Sinclair designed it alongside his team, and the Lego set acknowledges that by including a fitting tribute: a minifigure of Sir Clive Sin…",
