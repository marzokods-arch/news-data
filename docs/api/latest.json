I was born to do one thing in this life, and that's to incessantly annoy everyone around me with my earworm flavour of the month. You know, those song soundbites that involuntarily bury into your brain before vomiting their way out of your mouth for hours, days, or even weeks on end. There was that time I got really into humming the Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare every time I accomplished a task. Or when I couldn't stop walking around singing just the drop from Tekken 7's Infinite Azure stage. My current one? The first verse in Heartbeat, Heartbreak from Persona 4. Or singing the chorus while hitting the Narukami Shuffle to the best of my ability. I'm still working on that part, my shuffle game is weak. Almost all of us will experience an earworm at some point in our lives, and there's a good chance at least one of them will be a song from a videogame. I mean, next to regular ol' music, videogame soundtracks are some of the stuff we'll listen to…",

But take solace—there are thousands of people just like you who wouldn't trade those virtual Swiss skylines for anything. In fact, it seems like there are more than ever. Over 13 years after its release in 2012, Euro Truck Simulator 2 has surpassed its all-time concurrent player count peak on Steam, according to SteamDB . At time of writing, an hour has passed since the game hit a new all-time peak of 72,678, and while the number is flickering a bit, it's rare to see such a seemingly niche game so hoppin' over a decade after it came out. There are a few apparent reasons for this.

Then there's supernatural seafaring adventure Davy x Jones . Originally launched in August, Davy x Jones is a roguelike FPS where you play a headless freebooter named Jones, battling through the underworld in first-person combat while accompanied by a chatty skull companion named Davy. Davy x Jones enjoyed a pleasant, if quiet reception on its early access release, with players praising its imagination but criticising its rough edges. But the shooter has just had its hull thoroughly careened, with a massive update expanding and overhauling its fundamentals in significant ways. Chiefly, the update doubles Davy x Jones' scope by adding a second mode of play, letting players helm a \"living ship\" as they explore the underworld in third-person sailing.

A striking example was recently provided by Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto, who revealed that Master Chief's suit design was revised nine times before Bungie settled on his final look. Lehto, who is an alumnus of Ohio's Kent State University, was speaking to Kent State Magazine (via GamesRadar ) about the impact his education had on his future career. During that interview, he chatted about the process Bungie went through to design Master Chief's armour. \"The creation of the Master Chief is something that I went through so many wringers to try to find the right look, the right feel, the right stature for such a character,\" Lehto explained. \"We tried a lot of things.\" Some of these initial designs have made it to the Internet, such as Shi Kai Wang's early concept for Master Chief. Apparently, Bungie felt those early designs were too stylised, and Lehto's later concept borrowed elements from the M1 Abrams tank and the lines of an Apache helicopter.

Favourably compared to Katana Zero , it received near-universal praise for its crisp pixel art, Bionic Commando-esque platforming challenges, and surprisingly involved storyline. Two years on from Sanabi's launch, Wonder Potion has now released an expansion for Sanabi. Titled Sanabi: A Haunted Day , it’s a prequel spinoff in which you play as a different character from the main game. Also, it's completely free. Sanabi: A Haunted Day puts players in the role of Major Song, who has a minor role in the base game. As mentioned, the DLC takes place before the events of Sanabi, with Song investigating a sprawling robots scrapyard which the DLC's Steam page says is plagued by \"strange phenomena\". Alongside the new location, Song has a completely different moveset from the base game's protagonist. While she lacks a grappling hook, she is nonetheless capable of \"agile aerial manoeuvres\" such as an infinitely replenishable mid-air jump. She also wields a massive shotgun—which I always find endearing i…",

A highlight of those anthologies were the stories about Gotrek and Felix, a duo in the sword-and-sorcery tradition, with one a homicidal maniac and the other a simple poet doomed to follow the other around recording his adventures while trying not to get killed by them. They were a perfect encapsulation of Warhammer, grim but also a bit silly, heroic but also earthy. Eventually they'd get their own novels, but first they appeared in a compilation of short stories called Trollslayer. Honestly, I don't think the Felix and Gotrek stories worked as well once they were expanded out to novel length. With a few exceptions, almost all of their best adventures were short stories like those collected in Trollslayer, which is why I'm interested in the special edition Games Workshop recently announced . The hardcover book comes with a bookmark shaped like an axe, art prints including a map of the Old World and a wanted poster for the book's ostensible heroes, two coins—a gold crown from Felix's home of the Empire, and a silver dwa…",

Whether we're looking at a big stompy battle hulk in the Battletech tradition or something closer to the Armored Core school of air-dashing, hover-skating war machines, we're an outlet more than willing to say \"wow, cool robot.\" For some of us, it's a fascination that runs deep enough to bleed over into the physical. If you've found yourself (or someone you love (sorry)) wishing for a more material mecha pastime, Gundam plastic models—or Gunpla—will get you there. A word of warning: Gunpla sickness settles in fast. I only built my first kit about a year and a half ago, but as I write this, there are two displayed mobile suits, three assembled models in boxes, and one unopened kit awaiting assembly in my field of vision. But if you're ready for your first dose of mecha-building brain poison—as brain poisons go, it's a pretty good one—there are some great Cyber Monday deals to get you on you…",

Fans have speculated for years as to whether he's a virus-infected mutant, a radiation-poisoned ghoul, both, or neither, and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has weighed in on the debate with a larger point: any interpretation is right, so long as it's designated as such. He said as much in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel yesterday—the same channel where he routinely shares insights and commentary from his entire body of gamedev work, including everything from the original Fallout to Wildstar and The Outer Worlds. The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't. To summarize, his argument is thus: canon is \"whatever the owner of the IP says it is,\" an individual's interpretation is personal and freeform and therefore \"you can't be wrong,\" and authorial intent is another matter altogether that usually differs from team member to team member, and may even diverge greatly from canon.

My current pair is the Audioengine HD3, which don't go on sale all that much, so the current sale price at Amazon and at Audioengine is a genuine deal. These are the speakers I currently own. They look great, and sound plenty good for the size. The connection options make them very versatile: Bluetooth, USB, RCA, and 3.5mm aux. Get a bigger pair of bookshelf speakers if you're building an audiophile hi-fi setup, but for a warm sound in a stylish form that's easy to stick on your desk and connect to your PC or phone, I'm very happy with these.

Every MMO player's keybinding setup is different, like a snowflake. One boon of the genre is that we can customise our inputs to our heart's content, and no one answer is wrong. Want to use an MMO mouse? Godspeed. Want to bind your gap closers to the right bracket? Why not! Want to move around with T, F, G, and H? I think you're probably some kind of pervert, but go ahead. Chase your bliss. Only, I think we all need to reckon with something—that we are not as peaceful in private as we are in public. I know you've seen glimpses of your friend's UI and gone, internally, 'what is wrong with you?' Inside of our tiny hearts, we indulge our capacity for judgement more than any of us would like to admit. Thus do I call upon you to, for the duration of this article (and some civil debates in the comments, please) state your case and claim. Each of our …",

It might not be a videogame, but mercifully for my attention span, it does show brief gameplay of one in its most recent episode: Tolkien is seen playing none other than extraction shooter tour de force Arc Raiders . Eurogamer highlighted a LinkedIn post that shared the story of how it came to be. Embark's marketing lead, Ashley St. Germain, said of the cameo: \"There’s a lot to be thankful for this year, but I don’t know how I’m going to top this week. On Monday South Park inquired if a character could play Arc Raiders in an upcoming episode, on Tuesday we provided footage, and on Wednesday we were in season 28’s 'Turkey Trot' episode. Like Tolkien, I guess a lot of us just can’t put down Arc Raiders.\" It's not the first time South Park has referenced popular videogames with straight-up footage.

A big part of the experience is managing your stash and selling anything that doesn't make the cut—well, if you're good enough at extracting with all of your loot. (Image credit: Embark) But first, you need to know what to sell. Learning which items are worth the most Raider Coins will mean you can buy more parts and weapons when times get tough. And knowing which ones you'll need for crafting and quests is crucial so you don't get stuck later on (it'd be nice if the game told you this, unfortunately it doesn't). Knowing the worth of items will also help you decide what to take back to Speranza with you when you're looting Topside.

Like roughly half of the internet, I am fascinated by Kowloon Walled City . Built on the site of a military fort, the Walled City was a Chinese enclave situated within former British Hong Kong. Its existence was tolerated by Britain provided China made no effort to exercise its jurisdiction. This peculiar legal status left it largely ignored by both nations, and as such it became the site of rapid, unplanned urban development through the latter half of the 20 th Century. At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth. More than 35,000 people lived in an area of six and a half acres, giving it a density ten times that of Earth's most tightly packed cities like Giza and Manila.

Reacting to Sektori's launch on Bluesky, former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen said reception to the twin-stick shooter had been \"awesome\" and \"much more than I expected for such a niche thing\". Lahtinen fully appreciates the highly specific appeal of Geometry Wars-style games, likely why Housemarque itself pivoted to making third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros. Now though, Lahtinen says the response to Sektori has given him hope. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. I went into this fully knowing I would never recoup. It would be my calling card, but nothing people would have ever heard of,\" he says. \"But 100+ Steam reviews, 97% positive + ~90 Metacritic is unexpected to say the least.\" Following this, …",

From 1440p beats to higher competitive 1080p panels, all the way to something lush and OLED, there are plenty of different monitors to get your teeth stuck into. Though please don't actually bite your monito. Still, 1440p remains the sweet spot for those of you looking for the best bang for your buck, and we've seen a steady march of excellent contenders released in the last year, so expect to see some good discounts, particularly for models with a larger panel size. 1080p stays as the budget choice, but given the influx of high refresh rate screens, it's safe to say this resolution is sticking around as the…",

The only bummer is that early pets aren't very strong, but upgrading the flute turns the instrument into a real game changer. Some classes start with a taming advantage (and the Beastmaster even ranks quite high in my 99 Nights in the Forest class tier list ), but the flute is available to everyone regardless of role. Every upgrade unlocks new animals to befriend too, so instead of squishy bunnies, you can roll up on the Cultist Stronghold with a Mammoth. To keep you from meandering too long, I've got a quick step-by-step on how to upgrade the Taming Flute in 99 Nights in the Forest. Then, after mastering the basics, I suggest checking out my complete list of tameable animals to start your own survival crafting zoo. How to get the Taming Flute in 99 Nights in the Forest (Image credit: Grandma's Favourite Games) You can get the Taming Flute for free at the animal shelter—it's sitting out in the open to pick up—or by giving the Pelt Trader a Wolf Pelt.

Introduced to Tempest Rising \"by popular demand\" , the superweapons take the form of base structures and come equipped with a powerful standard ability, plus the potential to \"unload devastating payloads\" onto your opponent. The GDF's superweapon of choice is the drone strike station, which Slipgate summarises as \"a battle-management node that syncs directly with the GDF's satellite constellations to coordinate orbital strikes\". When constructed, it establishes a \"massive vision radius\" around itself, significantly expanding the range at which the GDF can use their intel-based abilities.

There's been no better time to try it than its 15th anniversary, as the original game is going for just $1.19 on Steam . That's the lowest it's ever been, with a price of $5.99 standing as the steepest discount recorded by SteamDB in the last two years: that's a jump from 70% to 94% off. You can also get the bundle with all the games in the series that made it to Steam for a little over $13. Thematically it's somewhere between a high school drama, Saw, and an Agatha Christie novel, with a psychotic teddy bear turning an academy into a prison of murder and mischief. While it is a visual novel, it's more gamey than the genre name perhaps implies: you investigate murders as they happen and try to pin the deed on the right culprit in a stylish minigame, literally \"firing their words back at them\" with metaphorical truth bullets.
