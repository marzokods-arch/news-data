Every so often, Blizzard has to put the clamps on damage numbers and turn everything down, because numbers getting too high is bad for everybody. The idea is that proportionately things stay the same—you're not actually getting any weaker. However, WoW is a 21-year-old game, and sometimes things get a little skewiff. For example: There are now healing potions in World of Warcraft, potions that a first-time player might conceivably pick up, that do literally nothing. As spotted by one user on the game's subreddit , a Minor Healing Potion at the time of writing currently reads: \"Use: Restores 0 health.\" Not one for letting threads fool me, I decided to hop onto my character to verify and, surely enough, there are multiple healing potions and food items that currently restore zero, or \"-0\" health.

Before you get your hopes up for the kind of co-op you get in Skyrim Together , I should warn you that Witcher Online doesn't sync enemies between players, meaning that you won't be able to team up with some friends to take down a boss. It also doesn't sync horses, so anyone riding one will appear to be racing along in midair, and the same goes for sailboats. You can't play Gwent together either, though you can enjoy some company while fishing on the pier. Which is nice.

Sure, we don't really know who performs best in the endgame yet, and won't until after launch, but similar to Zenless Zone Zero, the usefulness of characters is primarily dependent on which type of team they perform best in. A character can be good because they're versatile and free-to-play friendly, or because they're currently the meta DPS or support for a specific art. Since Arknights: Endfield features elemental arts and combo skills which activate upon fulfilling specific conditions, such as reactions, team comp is the be-all and end-all. Currently, the top-tier teams are cryo and heat (though the latter has far fewer characters), though neither is free-to-play friendly, since they require six-star characters to shine. On the other hand, electric and cryo/physical hybrid teams are very free-to-play friendly, since most of the characters you need are four or five-stars.

      "body": "More quizzes! (Image credit: Larian Studios, PC Gamer) Want to keep testing your knowledge of gaming trivia? We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Last year I made a quiz all about recognizing a game logo from just a single letter —and yes, I did all 26 letters of the alphabet. While I was laboriously putting that quiz together I noticed something interesting: a lot of games use a very stylized letter A in their logo. There are several logos where the A has someone standing inside it, a few with eyes or a face, and some shaped like an element from the game itself. I guess it's just a just a pleasantly flexible letter that designers can have a little fun with. So, I put together another letter quiz, and this time it's all about the letter A. I'll show you an A from a game logo, you type in what you think the game's name is. Don't worry, there aren't 26 of them this time. Let me know how you did in the comments!",

A mini patch, 12.0.1, will arrive in the next month and will continue to improve core WoW features, senior game director Ion Hazzikostas told us in an exclusive, wide-ranging interview. And other tweaks will happen as players figure out how to evade the limitations Blizzard has placed on their favorite combat add-ons, particularly those that simplify raid combat. 'We probably should have done it sooner' Hazzikostas chatted for nearly an hour in a broad interview covering the history and role of player-developed add-ons from Warcraft's beginning in 2004 until today. \"Add-ons have been part of the game since literally day one, since beta,\" he says. \"What we sta…",

The announcement came as part of Enshrouded's anniversary update and new roadmap reveal, celebrating two years in early access with details on upcoming features and rather interesting player milestones. Players have somehow spent nearly 21,000 years collectively exploring Embervale, and Steam says I've contributed 300 hours towards that myself, so I'm not wagging my finger at anybody. And even though parts of it remain unfinished, Keen Games says a whopping 5 million players have started the journey through Embervale's massive map. The added animal husbandry features seem pretty popular too, though I'm interested to know what kinds of critters make up the \"6 million pets tamed\" stat.

And the French game industry union Solidaires Informatique isn't taking it lying down. The union is calling for a half-day strike on January 22 over what it described as a \"disastrous announcement,\" and announced the following demands: An end to the cost reduction plan Maintenance and expansion of remote work conditions Decent pay raises for the coming year Solidaires Informatique described this as \"an initial response to the absurdity of management decisions,\" and said other strike actions are being considered: \"It is out of the question to let a boss run rampant and destroy our working conditions.

WoW's latest pre-expansion patch introduces a sweeping set of reworked systems ahead of Midnight's launch in March. Those changes included an overhaul to the armor transmog system, which is generating a lot of angst from players who are finding themselves forced to pay thousands of gold for the privilege of wearing outfits they'd already paid for. While we were skeptical about the proposed transmog updates back in November, the new system does have some appeal: Previously, transmogrification applied item appearances of your choice to equipment directly. You could save and apply entire ensembles at once, but whenever you replaced one of your equipment pieces—or if you just wanted to change outfits—you'd need to reapply your desired transmog and pay the associated fee for each piece of gear. (Image credit: Blizzard) The new transmog system is meant to replace those frequent transmog costs. Rather than paying to apply appearances to your gear itself, you instead purchase outfit slots that you can save ensembles to. Saving a transmog setup to an outfit slot costs a fee, yo…",

Verbinski, who directed the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the American remake of The Ring, and animated Western comedy Rango, was pretty blunt in pinning the blame on Epic's Unreal Engine , which has been used more and more for visual effects in film and television in the past several years, including the Fallout TV series . \"I think the simplest answer is you've seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said in an interview with pop culture site But Why Tho? . \"I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards.\" Epic Games has now responded to Verbinski's statement. In an email sent to PC Gamer, Patrick Tubach, VFX supervisor at Epic Games, said: \"It’s inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI.

The announcement also brought us a release date: Crimson Desert will launch on March 19. That means we've got just over eight weeks before we get our full and proper introductions to protagonist Kliff and the fantasy world of Pavel, and see just how well Pearl Abyss has managed to cram so many kinds of gameplay into one Kliff-shaped package.

But that was nothing next to seeing Sonic appear on the Nintendo GameCube. What madness was this? Luckily I'd already swapped one console war for another, having been an early adopter of Xbox. I fell in love with Halo and would go head-over-heels for Halo 2, and lived for years with a magazine poster for Halo 3 behind my television with that magical promise: \"Finish the fight.\" I did do other things, I promise, but I spent an awful lot of time with the Master Chief, and Xbox and Halo became synonymous in my mind with peak console gaming.

The argument for vaulting them, as laid out by Epic's design director Ted Timmins , is that Fortnite had a \"combat fleeing issue\" that spoiled fights. \"If we are being honest with ourselves,\" he said, \"as much as we all love shockwaves, is it actually skilful to just throw one at your feet and immediately be able to escape an engagement?\" This echoes some but not all of the arguments made by streamer NickEh30 in December . He too said that shockwaves made escaping fights too easy—but added they also negate high-ground advantage, ruin early rotations, and outclass all other mobility items. Fans wondered whether NickEh30's prompted Epic's move, but Timmins denied that in his post. I and most users on the game's subreddit disagree with the decision to vault shockwaves—I'll explain why in a minute—but I do sympathize with both Timmins and NichEh30. Shockwaves can be a crutch. I certainly lean on them to cover up mistakes: if I'm caught out of position without cover, outplayed…",

In case you're unaware, WoW's been of a mind to fix its UI mod (addon) problem for a long time. Specifically, combat addons—the idea being, a player shouldn't have a raw competitive advantage because they had a bunch of third-party plugins installed. Blizzard announced its plans to cull combat addons last year, and that day has finally come. (Addons that don't impact combat are fine, although they do need updating.) I've hopped in and had some time to fiddle around with the changes on my Outlaw Rogue—both the lack of combat addons, the class changes made to facilitate that, and Blizzard's updated \"Cooldown Manager\" and Personal Resource display.

While it's much more subtle and nebulous than these changes, Bungie has also claimed it's \"doubling down on the dark, gritty, and grounded sci-fi world\" through an updated visual style, \"deepened environmental storytelling\", and the narrative-tracking Codex.

The original suit alleged the company had \"engaged in a systematic strategy\" of buying up competitors, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, in order to maintain its social media monopoly. The case was brought before a US district judge in Washington, who ultimately ruled last year that Meta had not violated antitrust laws with these acquisitions. In his decision, Judge James Boasberg even noted that the FTC itself had reviewed and approved both Meta's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, as well as the company's 2014 purchase of WhatsApp. Undeterred, the FTC is appealing that decision, and still highlights those same acquisitions as the motivation behind its most recent appeal .

It's not the biggest addition in PowerToys 0.97 , but Cursor Wrap might just be mana from heaven for some PC enthusiasts. As the name suggests, activating this tool essentially links the edges of multiple displays together, so as you pop off the edge of one monitor, the mouse cursor should seamlessly appear on the opposing edge of the next display. I know Windows already does this when you have, say, two monitors, but when you have something like two rows of three displays, stacked on top of each other, it actually does a poor job of moving the cursor around. This is especially true if you have the desktop expanded across the whole caboodle. With Cursor Wrap, that's no longer an issue, and you'll find that your mouse can now zip vertically through displays with ease. It does the same thing even if you only have one screen, linking the opposing edges into a uni…",

Now a new report claims it's set to be released by the end of March. According to Digitimes (via Tomshardware ), \"Windows on Arm (WoA) platform notebooks using the N1X will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\" The report claims that after the launch of an initial variant of N1X in Q1 2026, three more versions of the chip will be released in Q2. What's more, Digitimes further says that Nvidia has a follow up, codenamed N2, lined up for release in the third quarter. If all this is true it's both exciting and somewhat peculiar. After all, we've just had the CES 2026 show , which surely would have been the perfect opportunity to get the maximum number of eyeballs on what Nvidia presumably plans to be a game changing chip for the PC industry. To pass that opportunity up only to launch a month or two later? That's a bit odd. Of course, the tech industry is currently in flux thanks to the ongoing RAMpocolypse . So that could be a factor.

The creator of Painkiller and current creative director of Witchfire , Adrian Chmielarz, sounds a little like a Cthulhu-stricken Lovecraft protagonist in his recent interview with Gamesindustry.biz . The cosmic entity in question? Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which has confounded executive suits and game developers alike by raking in enormous success despite being built by a core team of 30 people (and a large list of contractors) . At the very least, Chmielarz is talking from a place of comparison with Witchfire's similarly-sized team of just under 30 devs—he's cognisant of the above quibble, stating later in the interview \"we use outsourcing, and Sandfall Interactive used a lot of outsourcing\".

According to Weebit Nano , this agreement will see its ReRAM tech \"integrated into [Texas Instruments] advanced process nodes for embedded processing semiconductors.\" Despite what the name suggests, ReRAM isn't actually Random Access Memory, but a Non-Volatile Memory (think NAND, but not—I'll elaborate shortly). So, why is this worth getting excited about? For a start, we've not really heard a peep about the tech in a long old time, and this high-profile deal pushes it back into the spotlight. For another, ReRAM will apparently give traditional flash memory a run for its money as Weebit describes it as a \"low-power, cost-effective NVM that has proven excellent retention at high temperatures.\" To elaborate, ReRAM is non-volatile, so it's more like NAND in that it can retain data aft…",

What I do remember well is the setting: Control is an action game, but it's also a very arch horror game set in the austere pebblecrete hallways of a brutalist tower called The Oldest House. Control's story and setting is often compared to the fictional SCP Foundation, which is basically hyper-conspiratorial crowdsourced weird fiction that has also inspired stuff like Lethal Company . I don't know how much more I can say to sell Control to you, and it's probably a waste of time anyway because money talks: Control is $4 on Steam at the moment. That's for the Ultimate Edition too, which means you also get both expansions and all post-launch content bundled in. A bunch of …",

The 3D spin-off will launch at the same time across all platforms, so you can have your pick between the fancy bells and whistles of your machine or take Endfield on the go as soon as servers are live. It's certainly an upgrade from my days of using the Google Play PC client or whatever overly demanding emulator was fashionable at the time. And while Hypergryph's new strategic RPG certainly looks different from the first game, it's still a gacha, so I've got the Arknights: Endfield launch times organized by time zone below to make sure you're on top of those dailies. When is the Arknights: Endfield unlock date and time? Arknights: Endfield launches at 11 am (UTC+8) on Thursday, January 22. Since it's a global launch on all platforms, you folks living in Pacific time can play a day early on Wednesday, January 21, at 7 pm PST. The Arknights: Endfield client is available through Hypergryph's official site or Epic Games . If you plan on playing, I recommend at least checking out the official site (and missions ) ahead of tim…",

But after that, he says it's on employers and job seekers to, more or less, just start using AI. \"The demand side of this is a little bit like, every firm has to start by using it,\" said Nadella, throwing in some industry-standard hyperbole by calling AI a \"cognitive amplifier\" that gives you \"access to infinite minds.\" The…",

The scene would be unrecognizable without all the indie hits that first found a home on Steam, and early attempts to mimic that plumber in the red hat led to the tech that gave us Doom. So dust off that gamepad and embrace the inherent fun of jumping over stuff with me. It's a genre largely unbeleaguered by big-budget bloat, intent on retaining the purity of old-school action at its best. Platformers remain fascinated with the ability of the videogame to sate a primordial human urge: to run, be free, and soar weightlessly over certain doom. From cerebral puzzle platformers, to parkour simulations, to cotton candy collectathons, the genre is as diverse and worth celebrating as it’s ever been. Oh yeah, and don't expect to see any metroidvania games like the oft-celebrated Silksong or, well, Castlevania here. We already covered those!

The series has finally wrapped up now, and Newbon spent a chunk of the final episode summing up his feelings about a game he clearly enjoys playing as much as he enjoyed working on. \"Baldur's Gate 3, the game that just keeps on fucking giving,\" is how he sums it up. \"It is one of my all-time favorite games,\" he goes on to say, \"not because simply I'm biased because I'm in it, it actually is one of the best-crafted games I've ever, ever played. It's absolutely extraordinary and really wonderful.\" And, of course, it's a deeply personal game for its creators. \"Just goes to show to you folks,\" Newbon says, \"fuck AI.

Nowadays, movie fans seem much less impressed by CGI in films. There's a general distaste for a perceived overuse of CGI in favor of practical effects, and there are a lot of complaints that recent CGI is less-convincing and more fake-looking than it used to be, even in the biggest budget films. In an interview with But Why Tho? , Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, Rango, and the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, was asked why visual effects in movies just don't look as good as they used to. \"I think the simplest answer is you’ve seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said. \"So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects.
