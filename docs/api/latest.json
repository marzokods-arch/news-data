      "body": "Wednesday, Ubisoft announced a \" major reset \" of its organizational hierarchy and game development plans that CEO Yves Guillemot said would foster \"the conditions for a return to sustainable growth.\" That included a fundamental shakeup to its internal studio structure, the cancellation of six projects including the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake , and for some reason, a promise that more \"player-facing generative AI\" was on the way . As you might expect when a company announces everything is on fire, everything is on fire: as CNBC pointed out a day after the announcement, the company's share price went down by around 34% after the restructuring was announced. When the stock market closed yesterday the price sat at €4.06 (around $4.80) a share. This marks the lowest point in a long downward trajectory going back to 2021 as you can observe on CNBC's website , and it's the lowest share price the company has seen since 2011—the year it reported a $74 million loss . While it's not the lowest the share price has ever been, nor is it perhaps as dicey as the hostile takeover Vivendi backed off from in 2018 , it signals the graveness of this moment for the company. It's no sur…",

Before I played No Players Online, I knew nothing about it, except that it was a horror game set in a server for an abandoned multiplayer FPS. In some ways it is exactly that, but in others it is not really that at all. If that description seems confounding, then it is only accurate to my experience with this deeply strange game, which is at once a fairly derivative horror experience and one of the oddest puzzlers I've ever played. Even the history of No Players Online is confusing. I've been vaguely aware of the game for years, but it turns out that the No Players Online I was familiar with is not the No Players Online I just played. The commercial version that launched late last year and costs $15 is based upon a free, short game released back in 2019, developed by Adam Pype with sound design by Viktor Kraus and addit…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I love a classic videogame dungeon. Give me dark caves and dripping ceilings. Give me puzzle doors and weird keys. Give me traps under every flagstone and monsters in every room. The best dungeons are burned into my brain as some of my favourite levels of all time, lurking forever in the shadows of my memory like a gang of 2d4 skeletons. But how well do you remember your years of excursions in the underworld? Our latest quiz tests exactly that, challenging you to match each ominously titled dungeon to its game of origin. Only the kind of seasoned adventurer who knows their Underearth from their Underdark and their Dredmor from their Deadmines will prevail. It's multiple choice, so even when you're stumped you can at least make a guess—but remember that down in the dark, giving the wrong answer to a riddle can have dire consequences… Let us know how you did in the comments below!",

The Killing Stone is a card battler with demonic overtones that owes at least some of its soul to 2021's Inscryption . The meat of the experience is a simulated board-game where you play cards that come to life as little critters. These critters form up in a line on the board, fighting to destroy a lidless eye that represents each player's life. Destroy your opponent's eye and you can move on to the next battle. If your eye gets poked to oblivion on the other hand, well, let's just say the results aren't to your advantage. Surrounding this mechanical core is a narrative meta-layer where you explore the spooky house of an old magus, researching upgrades to improve your chances of beating the game and entreating with its curious denizens. As you can hear in the trailer, the game boasts some hefty voice-acting talent…",

That mod is Marrow , a new campaign for Monolith's deviously difficult and ferociously violent shooter. It's sort of Blood's equivalent of John Romero's Sigil —a continuation of Blood's storyline that concluded with protagonist Caleb slaying his demonic former master Tchernobog. Like Sigil, Marrow restricts itself to Blood's original assets (weapons, enemies etc) to power the experience, focussing instead on using those assets to build large and complex new maps for the game. Episode One of Marrow has been out for a while, releasing back in 2023. Marrow's creator, Nick Palsmier, intended to issue a general release of Chapter 2 as close to the launch of Nightdive's 2025 remaster as he could. But as he explains in a post on ModDB \"Responsibilities and life got in the way. As did a trickle of small issues.\" Still, it hasn't been that long since Blood: Refres…",

Highguard was received as a 'one more thing' trespasser that had claimed an unearned seat of honor, although its developer did not pay for the slot as many assumed. The reveal has become a case study in how not to announce a game, but what really got people worked up is what Highguard's developer did next: nothing. Highguard is launching on Steam next week, but the studio still hasn't said anything new about it publicly, aside from a tweet today announcing a livestream. Starved for a new trailer to dunk on in the endless competition to win the social media Cynicism Cup, posters have had to settle for generic declarations of Highguard's cookedness. That cynicism-for-cynicism's-sake aside, it feels safe to say that general distrust of this kind of game is at an all-time high. In Highguard's case, you do get a whiff of hubris fro…",

Rolling for the most powerful characters is only half the game; the rest is building the most efficient material processing plant you can. Now that everyone's realized what kind of game they're actually playing, someone went and built an entire simulator for designing factory blueprints to share with other players. EndfieldTools is currently getting slammed with traffic because it's the best spot for sharing factory blueprints and testing out layouts without having to waste resources in-game. The factory planner is essentially a simplified version of the real thing with tools to simulate how efficient your setup truly is.

My cold take: New Vegas is still my favorite entry in the series, including the 2D originals. My hot take: Fallout 4 is a vastly superior game to Fallout 3, and deserves more credit than it gets in RPG snob circles. The writing is much better than you remember, with more interesting quests and characters than Fallout 3⁠. The color, vibrancy, and general art direction look fresh even 10 years on. The gunplay is so much better and more satisfying than the prior 3D Fallouts, and the weapon customization is a genuine advancement over what you see in New Vegas.

Players loved that tech demo so much the sim quickly rocketed onto Steam's list of top wishlists, where it now sits in slot number 10 alongside big-budget games like Ark 2 and Forza Horizon 6. Well, sharpen your sword and polish your armor, because Half Sword is ready to spill its guts all over early access: it launches Friday, January 30. That's just next week! To celebrate, the developer, aptly named Half Sword Games, released a comically grisly new trailer set to a soundtrack of what I'll call one of the most delightfully unhinged songs ever written for a game in history.

This is the trick that Arknights: Endfield is playing on all the people giving it a try now that it's released, and many players are discovering that there's been a factory builder inside them all along. \"Came for the combat. Stayed to be a factory worker,\" Reddit user The_4th_Wonderland wrote, speaking for me and a lot of other players who had no idea they'd be spending hours building conveyor belts rather than fighting rock monsters for XP. Users on the Endfield Reddit have started to chant a mantra borrowed from the Factorio community: \"The factory must grow.\" I had the exact same experience when I played one of the early beta versions of the game.

While the fate of Ubisoft's many studios is the more pressing concern (including staff already going on strike), along with the threat of a pivot towards even more live service games and generative AI, a gamer-level problem is that one of Ubi's most iconic adventures exists in a surprisingly sorry state. Fortunately we're PC gaming nerds, and we know how to solve such problems. Where to buy Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time If you don't already own a modern digital copy of Sands Of Time, you've got a few options. The first and most convenient is Steam , where the game goes for around $12 (£9). At the time of writing, the Ubisoft Store has the game discounted down to under $3 (£2), although, yes, you'll have to download it through their app. You can launch it through Steam after doing so. The third option is GOG , but you might want to wait just to buy there: At the time of writing, GOG has just announced th…",

The letter's signatories, led by Labor Caucus co-chairs Steven Horsford, Debbie Dingell, Mark Pocan, and Donald Norcross, say they have \"serious concerns\" that the acquisition will lead to layoffs, studio closures, wage suppression, and an unwelcome concentration of sports and entertainment brand ownership that could lead to \"anticompetitive coordination.\" Median worker pay at EA has declined steeply year over year, the letter states, a trend that suggests the company \"may already face limited competitive pressure to retain or reward talent.\" It goes on to say that EA has eliminated more than 1,700 jobs since 2023 and warns that even deeper cuts could result if the acquisition is closed because of the massive debt financing involved, \"which creates strong incentives for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting mea…",

So when I stumbled across the Isometric NYC city map project, I was at first properly stoked—and then deeply conflicted. Isometric NYC is the one-man effort of Andy Coenen, attempting to render all of New York City in an isometric pixel art style distinctly reminiscent of the SimCity series . But rather than laboriously building this city pixel-by-pixel, Coenen has instead leveraged multiple AI agents to create this city map. The entire process required much more work than dashing off a handful of prompts, but you are perhaps beginning to understand my sense of conflict. Coenen himself is a software engineer currently conducting AI research at Google DeepMind . He explains that the original idea for Isometric NYC was to use Google's \" Nano Banana to generate a pixel art map from satellite imagery tile-by-tile,\" though Coenen ultimately used…",

That's according to The Verge , which claims that sources have told them staff are using Anthropic's Claude, alongside Copilot, for AI coding tasks (aka vibe coding). Not that they're making the choice subversively; in fact, the software giant has been happy for its staff to try out various AI coding tools, including its own GitHub Copilot, Anthropic's Claude 4, and OpenAI's GPT-5. Apparently, Microsoft started the whole experiment last year , but just in the developer division, resulting in Claude Sonnet 4 being selected as the AI choice for paid users of GitHub Copilot, though the option to use others is still available. The Verge writes that now any staff member involved in 'Experiences + Devices' (i.e. Windows, Bing, 365, Surface, and so on) is being encouraged to experiment with Claude, even if they have no coding experience at all.

This new ROG Azoth 96 HE takes some of what Asus has built up to this point and tears it up. For instance, it's not mechanical in the same sense as its predecessors (or siblings, I suppose), as Asus has opted to go for its ROG HFX V2 Hall effect switches for gaming precision and power, rather than the increased tactility of a traditional mechanical switch. These have been upgraded over the older V1 switches kitted out to other Asus keyboards with Hall effect powers and were first seen on the Asus ROG Falcata , with optimisations such as a shorter overall travel (3.5 mm vs 4 mm) that's more noticeable in use than you'd think, plus a larger magnet for more precise customisation.

I'm sure I speak for us all when I say: thank god. Well, not all of us. To hear Fulton tell it, cutting the dog is a cross he has to bear at the studio. \"I did know I was going to get this question. And do you know what? There are some folks on the team that were relishing me getting this question because I cut it a while back.\" Why did Fulton Old-Yeller Old Yeller? He seems almost too irate at the social cost it's incurred to say: \"For development reasons, right? I don't need to go into any more detail than that, except to say there are a substantial number of people on the team who have yet to forgive me for that decision.\" In response to IGN prodding him about maybe sticking a dog in the sequel, he concedes, \"I hear you on that. Hey, for those people that still bear a grudge, this is my penance.\" Which, you have to admit, is quite funny. Fulton is clearly catching no end of flak from his peers for taking the dog away, but I'm…",

An unfair comparison considering the desktop chip doesn’t have to deal with the constrained thermal envelope and limited power draw of a laptop, and the 3D V-Cache really does make a difference. Despite the rainbow keyboard and presence of an RTX 5080 GPU, you’ll be surprised to hear this this isn’t a gaming laptop. MSI positions it as “engineered for the demands of STEM professionals,” which probably doesn’t mean gardeners, and then takes a puff on some burning leaves to huskily exhale the phrase “it operates like a high-tech brain”. Yeah, man. The Vector A18 HX may well “deliver the performance and reliability engineers need to excel in every challenge,” but luckily for us it also delivers the kind of frame rates that make PC gamers very happy, and is so obviously a gaming laptop in an unconvincing disguise with its 240 Hz display, seven heat pipes, and two fans to keep it all cool.

You could immediately take part in almost any event and get a supercar in minutes in FH5. In fact, you could easily have a whole garage of supercars in no time—for free—thanks to the Wheelspin system. Not exactly what I'd call a career mode, and it quickly diminished any satisfaction from performing well to earn money and save up for your first fancy ride. This leads me to the one line from Xbox's recent Developer Direct , which finally opened the hood on Forza Horizon 6 , that instantly brought me on board: Torben Ellert, design director of FH6, said, \"You'll start out as just a tourist in Japan.\" Ellert explains that \"your first goal is to join the Horizon Festival by completing the Horizon qualifiers.

It's more about the subjectivity of morality that honestly we see in the world today. There's no objective good, there's no objective evil. You couldn't get everyone in the world to agree that something is evil or something is good. That just doesn't happen.

I opted for one of the cheapest available at the time, but if you wanted something prettier, there are many more to choose from. It arrived in a nondescript brown cardboard box, which slightly tempered my expectations for the cooler within.

The first is that Secure Boot is a kernel-level security measure, and anti-cheat software that uses it will effectively get privileged access to the inner sanctuary of your PC. Secondly, older machines may not support Secure Boot or might not even have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is used to store cryptographic keys. This means older machines are left in the dust.

In response to a query about concerns over not being aggressive enough in placing orders with suppliers like TSMC, during Intel's conference call yesterday (transcript via Seeking Alpha ), Zinser offered a reply that didn't directly address the question but still made Intel's position clear. \"We are aggressively getting tools on Intel 7, 10, Intel 3, 18A—that is happening. And we will be increasing our wafer starts as aggressively as possible on those nodes.

In their latest video, Der8auer claims that the OPP is \"basically like a cashback thing where Nvidia tried to actively influence the AIBs and the pricing to make sure that some cards happen on the market and that they are actually being sold by the AIBs for the MSRP.\" Without that incentive scheme in place, Der8auer argues, \"You will have to expect massive price increases across all of these cards. So that means that MSRP that Nvidia communicated in the past basically no longer exists\" Der8auer says they don't know what the OPP actually stands for, but Hardware Luxx argues it to be 'Open Price Program' .

Basically, if something's bothering you—like, say, the recent transmog updates—it's not going to stay that way for long. In case you're unfamiliar, WoW's recently rehashed its transmog (a glamour/outfit system) to work on specific outfits you buy slots for with in-game gold. This has the upshot of not requiring you to visit a transmog specialist every time you get a new piece of gear, while reducing flexibility—due, in part, to the gold cost. Given you'll be saving money on not doing repeat visits to your favourite ethereal, Blizzard reasoned that this new way of doing things ought to be more expensive. This was not popular, because for a lot of players, myself included, futzing around with an outfit on the regular was part of the fun. I'm indecisive. I'm not a \"set and forget\" kinda guy.

One issue from the get-go was price. Extra chips, more packaging steps, and securing memory all add to the cost of production for Lunar Lake versus other chips.
