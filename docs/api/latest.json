Even before big-budget studios were employing whole-ass orchestras to perform grand symphonies, composers were making full use of synthesizers and sound chips to create pieces that would've had Beethoven telling all his pals \"Have you heard that One Winged Angel? It's pretty good.\" Videogame music is home to so many bangers that it would be a huge disservice if they were forever confined to the games they were created for, which is where the humble videogame concert comes in. It's a chance to hear your favourite tracks brought to life by an in-person orchestra, often complemented by visuals from the game and maybe even a guest appearance from the composer themselves. To my surprise, the first videogame concert happened far earlier than I ever anticipated—in August 1987 according to GameConcerts , where Dragon Quest composer Koichi Sugiyama presented the Fami…",

In many ways, it's bringing together the best of Black Ops 6, 3, and 2, and stirring it in one giant pot to produce yet another potent brew that'll have me grinding Mastery camos once again. But in a year where Call of Duty hasn't been so challenged in arguably well over a decade, largely thanks to Battlefield 6 , it's the small changes that matter just as much as sweeping ones. That said, a co-op campaign, an SBMM-free playlist, more Mastery Camos , Hybrid Combat Specialities, and double jumps are a pretty good list of sizable changes, even if it's not a radical reinvention. That's cool and all, but I'm more hyped about Overclocks, one of the few major upgrades to scorestreaks since Modern Warfare 3 (the first one) introduced point streaks—and it's a callback to the maligned Advanced Warfare of all things.

With over 22,000 players in the last 24 hours, Garry's Mod is the 62 nd most popular game on Steam by daily active users (according to SteamDB ).

One topic I wanted to get their thoughts on was optimization: Defect looks like a heavy game, but has surprisingly lenient specs⁠—RTX 2060 minimum⁠—and no mandatory ray tracing like we're starting to see in some games. The graphics arms race is proving ever more costly for devs and players, with diminishing returns: The cutting edge Metal Gear Solid Delta left me feeling cold, especially compared to the similarly photorealistic, yet more vibrant, striking, and ten years older Phantom Pain. Meanwhile, people's champions like Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6 are scoring points with players by not just running on lower-end hardware, but looking and performing well . This isn't just a question of tech and optimization, according to Palalic.\"Good performance in a game isn't always a technical problem, it's as much of an art problem as well,\" he told me. \"A really strong art team can work within any shading and rendering limitations that are presented and lean into those.

Probably because I'm being paid to do just that, but also because I think the trends are just plain interesting; we've had a golden age where everyone was trying to make an MMO , tectonic shifts in the kind of things players want to do , and ever-changing social dynamics that keep this aged genre vivid and interesting. One design shift I will never understand, however, is the bizarre affliction that struck MMO designers in the latter half of that 2010s-2020s golden age: The sudden and irrational belief that tab-targeting MMOs (or hotbar MMOs, depending on your accent) are old news, and that every MMO had to have some sort of action combat system in it.

As the series entered its second decade, it had already begun to veer away from historical drama and behind-the-headlines espionage. Treyarch was developing drone swarms for Black Ops 2, and Infinity Ward had dared to kick off the singleplayer campaign of Call of Duty: Ghosts in space. (Image credit: Activision) What Schofield was proposing, though, was something different: a futuristic moveset that would interfere with the fundamentals of CoD's sacred multiplayer component. Rather than merely providing novelty in the campaign, the boost jump would change the rules of competitive deathmatch, enabling players to reach high rooftops in newly vertiginous maps, and gain an edge through skilful combination of double jumps and mid-air dashes. If the idea backfired—drawing ire from a community which had grown used to its annualised fix of familiar FPS action—then Activision would be facing a serious threat to its most reliable cash cow.

But from CD Projekt's perspective, success seemed far from certain in the runup to launch. In particular, the Polish studio was deeply concerned about competition from another game released that summer, Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham Knight . The concern didn't derive purely from the fact that Arkham Knight was a hotly anticipated game. CD Projekt was more specifically worried that Rocksteady's open-world superhero game would shunt The Witcher 3 off the shelves at retailers. Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski explained the situation as it stood in early 2015: \"There was a big question about the execution of the marketing, are we going to be, you know, on par with, with the biggest out there?\" he said. \"We had huge, huge discussions, especially with the retail in the US, but also UK, you know, the main markets, Germany and so on, because it was about convincing them that we can actually be allowed to spend money in those channels.\" Nowakowski explains that retailers have different windows duri…",

The sequel, Salt 2: Shores of Gold , made some big improvements in that regard, while also enhancing the series' PvE focus and adding an infinite, procedurally generated world to explore. After spending the last three years in early access—during which Salt 2 gained a main quest, cooperative multiplayer, skill trees and underwater exploration among other things—it has now left alpha development , blasting a broadside of new features into Salt 2's hull to round out the core experience. Primarily, the launch update fleshes out the endgame experience for Salt 2. It adds a new NPC into the world who appears once players reach level 40, providing objectives for hunting down rare items players can exchange for legendary recipes.

It even introduces unique game modes. One thing the original version of the mod didn't offer, however, is multiplayer, due to how FromSoftware prohibits modded games from connecting to official servers. But the recently released 2.0 version of Elden Ring: Reforged addresses this, with the team creating a custom server to enable fully functional, FromSoft-style multiplayer. Update 2.0 introduces pretty much everything you'd expect from playing Elden Ring with other people. Summoning, invasions, and leaving messages for other players. According to Reforged's Nexus Mods page , it also offers \"advanced seamless coop support\", so playing with pals isn't limited to boss fights.

So while chatting with Dogubomb developer Tonda Ros this week, I naturally wanted to know what was coming next. With so many games being made into movies and TV shows, and since Blue Prince is so densely packed with stories and mysteries (some of which still haven't been fully uncovered yet ), I asked Ros if he'd been approached about a film adaptation. Might we see Blue Prince the movie someday? \"I have been approached, and I regret to tell the fans that it is not something I'm currently considering. To me, Blue Prince is this one game or this one piece of art in the medium of games. And so I couldn't really imagine it as anything else,\" Ros said. \"I'm a filmmaker myself. And before dabbling in game dev one of my dreams [was] to make a feature film. I have a lot of aspirations in that front, but I do think that each of my projects will be completely standalone.

The problem? Fish, apparently. I managed to play a little bit today without a ton of issues, but I wasn't the only one who experienced severe lag. Blizzard's been trying to figure out what's causing all the problems since the beta launched on Tuesday, and discovered yesterday that it might be some new fish technology that's bringing Azeroth to a crawl. \"We're still plugging away at this but we think we found a new problem,\" game producer Zorbrix wrote in a forum thread about the lag. \"FISH!\" They explained how there's new NPC behavior that's supposed to help creatures \"react to players and the environment in a more natural way\" instead of randomly wandering around and that it could be going haywire when too many players are nearby.

This year's paramilitary bacchanal, however, seems a more muted celebration: On Steam, Black Ops 7 is drawing Call of Duty's lowest launch day player count since the series made its return to the Valve storefront in 2022. According to SteamDB, which uses public data from the Steam API, there are 81,000 users playing Call of Duty on Steam at time of writing—well below the player counts of Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6, which are currently drawing around 370,000 and 236,000 simultaneous players, respectively. This does place Call of Duty in the top 10 of most-played games on Steam. But in comparison, when a similar amount of time had passed since Black Ops 6's midnight launch in 2024, Call of Duty was being played by almost 230,000 players on Steam. (Image credit: Activision) In other words, Black Ops 7 is generating roughly one third of the launch day interest on Steam that Call of Duty had mustered last year. Steam concurrent player count…",

A series of patches and U-turns have tried to soften the abrasive edges of the Portal's design—aimed at reducing the absurd power grind as well as making buildcrafting feel less restrictive and punishing. Still, these felt like temporary stopgaps—desperate attempts to staunch the bleed that didn't address the root issues at the heart of the new design. In a blog post last night, Bungie finally laid it all out: \"With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game.

Researchers in Japan believe they have cracked the problem, though, by developing a GPU-powered active noise cancellation system that's powerful enough to calm an entire room. That's according to NTT Laboratories , as reported by PC Watch . It claims to have developed the \"world's first spatial active noise control (spatial ANC) technology.\" Active noise cancellation (ANC) certainly isn't new, and many readers will probably own a gaming headset that sports the feature. What makes NTT's tech different is a combination of the speed of the sound processing and how it can be applied. Headphones with ANC use microphones to pick up nearby sounds, which are then sent to a small signal processor. This calculates the appropriate 'anti-phase' sounds to generate, which are then emitted via the speakers. The original noise and new sounds overlap and partly cancel each other out, greatly reducing the impact of the noise.…",

Specifically, Misery files contained a GSC helicopter model that Platypus said was \"left in the resources as a legacy leftover\" from the game's early days as an \"educational, non-commercial project.\" While the helicopter model never appeared in gameplay, the Misery developer said the model's inclusion was \"definitely an oversight on the de…",

If you're just using a light shield, then repairs aren't an issue at all, as all you need are regular plastic parts. But if you have a medium shield it'll cost much more. Repairing a medium shield costs requires arc circuitry and one battery. Now, the battery isn't exactly a precious resource, but the arc circuitry is. I only have seven lying around in my inventory right now, and if your shield is damaged below 50% you'll need two of these to repair it.

Nonetheless, new data from Mercury Research shows that, despite the frosty reaction towards these chips from the PC hardware community at large, it doesn't appear to have made as much of a dent in Intel's desktop market share as you might expect. MR reports that Intel's slice of the desktop CPU market is 4.9% lower in the third quarter of this year, compared to Q3 2025. So, despite AMD having had a relatively bumper year for desktop CPUs, it still trails behind Intel with 33.6% of the market share.

This little device shoots out drones that chase down enemies and explode. And when I say chase, I mean it; these drones don't complain about having to travel halfway across the map to find a target. If that sounds incredibly annoying to play against, then you're spot on. They're easy enough to shoot, sure, but you're wasting ammo shooting them out of the sky (don't forget how long reloading takes), and they're the perfect distraction. While the drones are unlikely to score many kills (it requires two to hit a target to bag a kill), having one damage an enemy you're fighting is more than enough to seal the deal. It's basically an easy way to soften up the enemy or get them to fire their gun, wasting their ammo or even revealing them on the map if they're not using a suppressor.

There's not much sexy to talk about—no new goodies, no balance changes that'll induce tears of joy—instead, it's death by a thousand cuts, if death was an improved game and cuts were small adjustments.

Starting with the joint venture between Adata and MSI , a new DDR5 module is set to appear on the market that is certainly going to be snapped up by anyone who needs as much RAM as possible in their PCs, without sacrificing performance. AMD and Intel's latest top-end desktop platforms (i.e. X870E and Z890) support up to 256 GB of RAM. However, to reach this amount, you normally have to buy four 64 GB DIMMs, filling every slot on the motherboard. When you do that, you're typically forced to use the memory's lowest speed (e.g. 4800 MT/s), which isn't ideal for something like high-resolution video editing. The answer to this is Adata and MSI's 4-rank DDR5 modules.
