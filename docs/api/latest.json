Until Larian unveiled Divinity, we didn't know what it was doing next—only that it wouldn't be Baldur's Gate 4. At GDC 2024, about nine months after BG3's release, Larian boss Swen Vincke dropped a bombshell: The studio would not make an expansion pack or sequel to its most successful game to date, and was parting ways with Wizards of the Coast and D&D entirely. But they sure took their time saying goodbye, huh? Cyberpunk 2077 is the only recent singleplayer game I can think of that has received more free, post-launch additions⁠—and that was in response to a deeply compromised launch. Baldur's Gate 3 started on top, and just kept climbing. Before Vincke's early 2024 farewell, BG3 had already gotten the überhard, permadeath Honour Mode, as well as an expanded, playable epilogue.

The guys who have some bristling kit of arcane brushes, tweezers, spudgers and sponges, and who put them to use painstakingly removing a fine layer of yellow —origin indeterminate—from the surface of masterpiece after masterpiece? It's a process of subtraction: some schmutz removed here, some cruft excised there. By the end of the job—which could take days, months, years—what you're left with is… the original piece, its glory unobscured by the detritus of centuries.

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . Nothing I have ever done has filled me with as much pride as The Half Pint, my hobbity pub serving patrons all across the idyllic Shire, which I built and manage from within early access sim Tavern Keeper. We serve a wide range of drinks and snacks, from reasonably priced wine and ale to skewers of ethically sourced meats (the source is an ogre and he seems very above board), host live music and any comedians who haven't been cancelled yet, and thanks to my business acumen we are absolutely rolling in it. But this isn't why I'm so proud of my little business. Tavern Keeper is a fantastic management sim, undoubtedly, boasting a great deal of flexibility and ways to keep the lights on while still providing plenty of wrinkles that keep you on your toes, from magical pyromaniacs to grumpy staff to huge parties demanding all of your attention. It's the interior decorating that's left me obsessed, though. (Ima…",

In 2025, as graphics cards, memory, and storage have become harder to find at reasonable prices, monitors have only become better value. So, should you have the rig to run it, there has never been a better time to upgrade to a 4K screen. Philips remains in good form, with its Evnia 27M2N3800A being arguably the best-priced 4K panel we've seen (and with a neat dual resolution mode). MSI just barely missed out on a nomination for its 271QR OLED monitor , which is a bright and super snappy panel. Acer, Asus, LG, and AOC all had strong showings this year, too, but in such a packed year, you need to pick just a handful and the Alienware and KTC below just managed to beat them out. Our Alienware pick is super quick, with a gorgeous HDR QD-OLED panel. The KTC monitor is a bit of an underdog without the recognisable name of Philips or Alienware, yet it's still a punchy, quick and affordable 1440p panel. If you're in the market for a new monitor, we have picked out three that deserve a nomination for the best monitor of the year. Come back on New Year's Eve to disco…",

I've spent an awful lot of time testing, using, and benchmarking gaming laptops this year, and we've had a bumper crop, too. With Nvidia releasing a whole new generation of graphics chips (and you can bet I've been testing a ton of those as well...), the best gaming laptop manufacturers have been hard at work either respinning their old machines to make way for the new GPU silicon, or completely redesigning their laptop chassis for a new year. And the very first one to land in my lap this year was definitely the latter, with the Razer Blade 16 popping up with a new design intent on taking the crown back from Asus. The ROG Zephyrus G16 was the hands-down winner last year, with a mix of stylish, slimline chassis and impressive gaming performance, while Razer's finest of 2024 looked bloated by comparison. Not so this year, as the Blade 16 is our first nomination for the best notebook of 2025. If you'd have told me that an MSI gaming laptop would be a nominee in our best gaming laptop of the year listing, I would have thought you were struggling with reality. M…",

I don't just mean outright frame rates, though that's no small matter. You can have a game that runs at well over 200 fps, but if the graphics are all wonky donkey, or the whole thing is less stable than a block-away-from-disaster game of Jenga, then it'll be no fun to play. Over the past 12 months, we've dug deep into the performance, graphics, and development quality of 13 games released this year. The majority of these, plus many others that we've played and tested (but not done a full analysis of), were basically fine: not great, not bad, merely okay.

Up front and centre we have RedGamingTech's claims that Intel's first collab' chip with Nvidia will be known as \"Serpent Lake\". It is, of course, official public information that Intel and Nvidia are collaborating on a generation of future APUs for PCs . So, the basic idea of such a chip is not a stretch. We just haven't had any details as to what that might actually mean. RedGamingtech describes Serpent Lake as an \"APU monster\" similar in remit to AMD's Strix Halo chip. It's said to sport Nvidia's next-gen Rubin GPU technology built on TSMC N3P silicon, while CPU tech from Intel's upcoming Titan Lake generation, more on which in a moment.

We've seen Shady Sands at its peak in Lucy's memory, as she realized her childhood recollection of an idealized cornfield actually took place during the brief time she spent there with her mother, but now we get to see it through the eyes of young Maximus. He's the same age as he was in last season's flashback to the immediate aftermath of the bombing, so we know something's likely to go wrong even as we tour idyllic suburbs patrolled by NCR troopers—one in veteran ranger armor complete with duster and gas mask. Max's father hands his mother a jar of pure rad-free water (siphoned from Vault 33, which is how they came to Rose MacLean's attention in the first place), and Jo Stafford sings You Belong to Me.

After a bit of semi-philosophical musing on the question of whether Shepard is alive following the events of Mass Effect 3 (spoiler: well, maybe ), Hale invited fans to \"email the powers-that-be who make these games and say, 'Give us more Shepard, please'.\" \"Because we will be there, because we should not go,\" Hale says. \"I would be there with bells on if they asked us to play Shepard again.\" \"I agree,\" Meer then chimes in with faux seriousness, \"but only under any circumstances.\" It could happen. BioWare made a point of offing Shepard at the start of Mass Effect 2 , and insisted that it was really for real—but then of course he was brought back to life by the Lazarus Project so he could save us all from the Reaper threat.

There's something fascinating about taking an artefact you're intensely familiar with and filtering it through the lens of a different culture, philosophy, and language. The same, I must presume, applies to videogame names. Or at least, that's the gossamer-thin justification I concocted to take 12 game names, filter them through 25 layers of Google Translate, and turn the results into a quiz. I've taken the (English) names of 12 reasonably well-known videogames and plugged them into machine translation. Then I did it again. Then again. And again. And again. From English, through Yiddish, Punjabi, Mandarin, Yoruba… on and on it went, until the final translation—back into English—returned something that really bears very little resemblance to the game's original name at all.

And between 2004 and 2018, it released 12 games, eight of which absolutely belong in every RPG lover's library. We're talking Alpha Protocol, Neverwinter Nights 2, New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, Tyranny, and yes, even South Park: The Stick of Truth. That's an incredible list of games, and while some of them are looking a bit long in the tooth these days, I can't bring myself to not recommend every single one of them—and that's not just because PCG news writer Josh Wolens would curse me if I badmouthed Alpha Protocol. Since 2018, though? Things haven't been so great. (Image credit: Obsidian) The Outer Worlds and its sequel, along with Avowed, have plenty of defenders. They reviewed well— including here —and have their fans. But they're missing what made Obsidian's previous games so absurdly compelling: the best-in-class writing, the big risks and quests that stick with me years later. It feels like its acquisition by Microsoft has taught it to be cautious and boring, just like its risk-averse owner. But it's wild that its biggest swings happened …",

The latter notably, if marginally, pips Philips and AOC's new 1,000 Hz gaming monitors to the high-refresh prize. But let's start with that 6K beauty. The new Samsung Odyssey 3D G9 G90XH is a 32 incher. Resolution-wise, it's the same 6,144 by 3,456 pixels as some existing 6K monitors, like the LG UltraFine Evo 32U990A-S . However, where that LG tops out at 60 Hz, the Samsung Odyssey 3D is good for 165 Hz at native 6K. It also offers an alternate 330 Hz mode running at 3K. In theory, that means the 330 Hz mode is an integer scale of 6K, so the image quality could be quite good. Intriguingly, it uses an IPS panel, not the VA tech that Samsung is known for. Response is quoted at 1 ms GtG. As if all that wasn't enough, and as its name suggests, the Samsung Odyssey 3D sports glasses-free 3D tech with eye tracking.

Sadly, festive first-person shooters are thin on the ground for some inexplicable reason. But as is so often the case, the FPS community has filled this smoking bullet-hole left by developers, decking PC gaming's gore-spattered halls with boughs of holly through the power of mods. To help fellow FPS-heads get into the Christmas spirit, I've put together a roundup of the best Christmas-themed mods for PC gaming's most renowned shooters (plus one additional stocking filler that I think should be brought to your attention). I've also assigned them a festivity rating (scored, appropriately, out of twelve) to give you some sense of just how much Yuletide cheer they cram down the barrel.

So far, I haven't been disappointed. We've seen numerous key locations in just the first couple of episodes, like Vault 24 and the Starlight Drive-In . And now, in the second episode, we've had a magnificent look at Area 51, as it was unveiled after the Brotherhood got its hands on cold fusion. (Image credit: Prime TV) The showrunners again proved how dedicated they are to depicting the Wasteland with care, a fact that executive producer Todd Howard raised during my interview: \"I always view the biggest character being the world. I think everybody involved with the show has taken such amazing care to treat locations with this obsessive authenticity.

It wasn't just me: a bunch of us at PC Gamer, movie fans and Witcher fans alike, missed it too. It's called The Rats: A Witcher Tale , a feature-length special that serves as a prequel to Season 4, and you can watch it right now on Netflix—though judging from evidence I'm about to present, I'm not sure Netflix really wants you to. Exhibit A: Netflix didn't do a heck of a lot to tell people about this movie. I get mail from Netflix in both my professional and personal inboxes, and they sent nothing about this special. Zilch. I also have an account on a Netflix press site that has absolutely zero mention of it. Odd. Weirder still, I searched the official YouTube channel and there's no trailer or even a teaser for it.

Ears pricked up following a Strefa Inwestorów report ( Google translated ) quoting Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski predicting a Witcher 3 expansion for May 2026. \"We expect another paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026,\" Chrzanowski said. \"We anticipate sales of 11 million copies at USD 30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million ($14.5 million). The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for The Witcher 4.\" That's not a whole lot to go on, but it does make sense. Chrzanowski also said he expects The Witcher 4 to launch in Q4 2027, which puts it in the admittedly massively open-ended time frame of 'not until after 2026' previously shared by CD Projekt. New Witcher 3 DLC would also be a guaranteed moneymaker. Some quick napkin math: CD Projekt has now sold more than 60 million copies, and if we assume a DL…",

Today I learned that it also does damage, and someone is currently trying to beat the entire game with it, because of course they are. YouTube user Bloblumordthe3rd calls the playthrough \"Garama%\" and releases a new video every week or so showing off their progress. They are by no means racing through the game with an ability that can only be barely described as lethal: Every fight takes ages as they patiently wait for the best moment to Garama! It took two hours of attempts to defeat the final boss of act 1, for example. The comments on Bloblumordthe3rd's videos are full of people surprised the taunt even does damage and that anyone would dare to actually use it in combat. \"This is like watching Sisyphus push the boulder and win,\" ParrotingCrow wrote. \"Silksanity will truly never end,\" LetsGetAwesome711 added.

Replays are usually something born from necessity, like work-related tasks, or my insatiable nostalgia for old RPGs. Anything else is an anomaly, but I'm happy to report that, at the behest of no one, I played Complusion's gothic action adventure game South of Midnight three times over the last eight months, so I reckon that means I like it. To be clear, that's two more times than I was asked to play for our South of Midnight review . I went at it a second time at my own leisure, then followed up again with a third replay so a friend could watch me, but I'll be damned if I didn't find some easy-to-miss, tiny detail with every press of 'new game' that made me fall in love with Hazel's journey through the American South all over again.

A passenger in the car was also killed in the crash. Zampella was a colossal figure in videogames, with his first major credit being lead designer on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. He'd go on to co-found Infinity Ward with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002, which not only created Call of Duty but reinvented it (and mainstream shooters more widely) with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. After a split with Activision Zampella and West co-founded Respawn, which has released the beloved Titanfall games, Apex Legends, and two Star Wars Jedi games. In the 24 hours since the news broke, industry figures have been sharing their shock at Zampella's death, and memories of their time working with him. One word of warning: while preparing this article I did the usual Google / social media searches for Zampella's name. If you do that on sites such as X you risk coming across some widely distributed footage of a crash: you don't want to see it, and it's also unclear whether the clips are legit…",

As I said in my Keep Driving review , I grew up in the US in a town that had—like many towns in the US—no real public transportation, so my first taste of real freedom was when I got my first car, a heavily used hand-me-down green Plymouth Horizon hatchback. I loved that clunky car, mostly because of what it represented: a chance to escape my house and my town and set out on the road with no real destination, only occasionally checking the map, blasting music, and paying for gas a few dollars at a time. Gotta save some cash for snacks. Keep Driving delivers impeccable vibes from a time when the stress of school was slowly being replaced by the clawing panic of having to figure out what comes after school. A real job. Re…",

One aspect of Fallout 4 I haven't considered much, however, is its replayability. But it's a point that design director Emil Pagliarulo feels strongly about, as he recently discussed. Speaking to GamesRadar , Pagliarulo explained how he believed the RPGs interweaving questlines—whereby the factions you support affect the choices available to you in the main quest—make it the most replayable Fallout game. Pagliarulo began explaining his position by talking about Fallout 3 . \"The interesting thing about Fallout 3 is there are no faction quests,\" Pagliarulo observed, a fact which separates Bethesda's first stab at Fallout from its Elder Scrolls RPGs. \"For Fallout 4, it was the first time we said, 'You play Skyrim and you play these factions, but they're disconnected from …",

Now there's more. The pair of Xbox 360 devkits that contain the build also have a drive containing early versions, in some cases very early versions, of the New Vegas DLC. The recovered files include PDBs with debug information that's invaluable in reverse-engineering efforts, and now the intrepid explorers have accessed cut content from the expansions, although some of it is far from what would be considered playable. Perhaps the biggest find is in the third DLC, Old World Blues, which has significant differences from the release version, and in particular a room that's restored to former glory.

On a personal level, what I wanted from Bloodlines 2 was basically 'Bloodlines 1, but fixed', an RPG that took all the wild, unconstrained ambition of the original and brought it up to modern standards with a new story and exploratory space on top. Yet while Bloodlines 2 had its merits—like its brilliant Malkavian detective companion Fabien—it was mechanically much simpler than Troika's game, while also lacking meaningful side-quests and any real sense of character progression. But if, like me, you're worried that we might never see a truly great vampire RPG, hold that thought. Next year, Rebel Wolves is due to release The Blood of Dawnwalker , and it might just be the vampire RPG we've been waiting for. As a reminder, The Blood of Dawnwalker is being made by Rebel Wolves, a Polish studio founded by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. If you're not familiar with Tomaszkiewicz's name, he was director of a little game called The Witcher 3 . And get this, Tom…",

Last week I was: Coping a little about Hades 2. 2025 was a bloody year for MMORPGs as a genre. And by bloody, I actually mean catastrophic: New World announced it'd be closing, Greg Street's MMO had its funding pulled , that ZeniMax game was killed before it could even hit the market, and a Warhammer MMO was cancelled . But World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 survived—which… isn't really any sort of surprise, really. In the world of MMOs, the old guard will always stand strong. It'll take more than a deeply ominous state of the industry (and the fact that no-one seems to get to make MMOs anymore ) to take these big boys down. Yet there's trouble in paradise: In a fascinating bit of coincidence , both World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 are in for a very interesting 2026 (and beyond). How either game is handled in this fateful year will set the tone for years to come. Turning that ship around Final Fantasy 14 has, as I and my fellow FF14 enjoyer Mollie Taylor have often said on this website, been in a weird state .…",

It's currently positioned as the third worst film out of the 429 with more than seven critic reviews on Metacritic this year, with a measly aggregation of just 26 out of 100. It's only three points better than Bride Hard but still miles (20 points) better than the current worst-rated film of the year—War of the Worlds, which from what I have been told is an awful lot of Ice Cube staring at screens peppered in with some not-so-subtle Amazon product placement.

The game received two new expansions which introduced player-created freelance missions and an overhauled mining experience, as five new ships. CCP's stats suggest these expansions went down well. Players created 9,130 missions for chancing mercenaries to take up, while the most popular new ship, the Pioneer, was manufactured 71,873 times, and destroyed 4,513 times. Players across the game also destroyed 12,406 player-made 'upwell' structures, which presumably led to a helluva lot of insurance claims. The number that really stood out to me, however, is how much ISK—EVE's in-game currency—was incinerated in the course of all this destruction. According to CCP, that number totals 1,142,260,784,813,930 ISK. That's more than one quadrillion ISK that went up in flames over the last twelve months.

You can see this for yourself by going into your PC's device manager -> Standard NVM Express Controller -> properties -> details -> class. It will be described as 'SCSIAdapter'. But Microsoft just announced that native NVMe support is now available in Windows Server 2025 ; essentially circumventing the entire conversion process and speeding things along. \"Switch onto Native NVMe as soon as possible or you are leaving performance gains on the table!\" Microsoft says in the announcement blog post. \"With Native NVMe in Windows Server 2025, the storage stack is purpose-built for modern hardware—eliminating translation layers and legacy constraints.\" (…",

      "body": "Reviews should always start with the most important piece of information, so here it is: you can't store your prized collection of lightly used cricket balls on top of the Acer Predator Orion 3000. Why not? Because it slopes backward, and they'll end up on the floor. The front support foot is slightly taller than the back one, giving it a lean of, if a fun 10 minutes spent with a spirit level and a child's protractor have produced correct results, about 10 degrees. This means you can still rest your coffee mug on the top, as long as it's not too full, but also that, if you're buying this smaller-than-average tower PC with the intention of it flitting flush with a piece of furniture, it won't. This may or may not be a problem, depending on how picky you are about these things, but the Predator logo that sticks off the front and looks rather like someone melded a Space Invader with a Decepticon means you might want to push it back a little further. Despite its drunken lean, it's not a bad case. The front panel ports are easy to get to, there's a bit of RGB behind that logo, and it's nicely compact at 28 litres, though slightly larger than previous Orion 3000 cases, which were 26 lit…",

      "body": "Here's some great news out of LG. The company has unveiled a new OLED panel that runs at a high refresh rate and uses an RGB Stripe subpixel layout. If you're not familiar with subpixel layouts, here's why that's a very good thing. Today's OLED gaming monitors have an issue. Not a huge one for gaming—any OLED is superb for playing games on—but more noticeable on some panels than others when you're browsing your desktop. It's especially noticeable if you're regularly typing out pages of words. It's called text fringing. Text fringing, as the name suggests, appears as a colourful border around characters rendered on an OLED panel. Sort of like a chromatic aberration effect in-game. It happens because the subpixels—red, green, and blue—don't align exactly with how the text is being rendered. In some OLED panels, that's because the subpixels are arranged in a triangular pattern, though LG's popular panels include a white subpixel in an RGWB structure. Text fringing is most obvious on panels with lower pixel densities, so namely 1440p monitors, though it'd be better to be rid of it completely. Well, that's what LG is offering with its latest OLED panel. Announced ahead of CES 2026, LG'…",

It's heavy and awkward too, but that's the price you pay for having everything you need in a gaming PC as well as proper airflow. Acer's case for the 2025 Predator Orion 7000 is an excellent example of the type. It's big and roomy and weighs a ton, with enough glass to satisfy your curiosity about what's going on inside and three light-up fans on the front to look good. There are three more fans at the top—the CPU is liquid cooled with an AIO—an intake at the back, and the GPU is vertically mounted so its cooling system is on display. This is a PC that wants to leave you in no doubt that it's on top of its heat dissipation. The front of the PC is the part you'll see most often, and Acer has chosen to place a 3D Predator logo behind a transparent front panel that stands proud of the case itself, a mesh-sided extrusion that gives hot air somewhere to escape around the edges and has a good, deep power button on the top you can easily find while groping around beneath your desk. It's a well-appointed case too, with a removable caddy for a second SSD that simply slips out of the top aft…",
