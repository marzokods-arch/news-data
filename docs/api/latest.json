Between increasing development turnarounds, ballooning budgets, cancellations and mass layoffs, the industry is finding it harder to reliably bring projects to conclusion, leading to fewer blockbusters coming out each year. Various reasons have been aired for these problems, ranging from overeager profit chasing, to mismanagement and the malign influence of private equity, alongside broader market influences like audiences playing fewer new games . But former Assassin's Creed director Alexandre Amancio thinks the problems are more fundamental than these influences. Indeed, he believes they go right to the heart of how gaming's biggest studios are currently structured. Speaking to GamesIndustry, Amancio, who directed both Assassin's Creed: Unity and Assassin's Creed: Revelations , said that the sheer size of modern development teams makes both sustainability and innovation extremely difficult: \"There's this theory that says whenever humans create something that surpasses a hundred people, it completely changes the dynamic of it.

This stems from a realisation that there is a ceiling to how much you can do on PC and console when you are perceived as a mobile-first game, and that you make compromises both in product design and go-to-market strategies when mobile is your lead platform.\" The trigger for this was Monument Valley 3, which initially came out exclusively on Netflix, being removed from the service a mere half a year after launch. \"After working with Netflix for a few years developing Monument Valley 3, the game launched in December 2024 with a strong marketing campaign behind it,\" she said, \"and six months later they told us they wanted to take it off the service.

Where things break down is, you don't seem to realize or recognize that there's a lot of other people out there and they all want different things. And this isn't just gamers, developers do this too.\" Cain acknowledged there's no right way to make a game; disagreements over how to properly optimize a game, what features do and don't belong, and so on all come up during the dev cycle and years after a game has released. An example he gives in the video is RPG romance. Whether you loved or hated how horny Baldur's Gate 3 was, it's clear that romanceable party companions are as popular as they are polarizing—and Cain said he's been pressured to include them even though they aren't to his taste.

As Gamesradar noted in its report on this, there's a video on YouTube where games marketing consultant Chris Zukowski talks about Valve's coveted \"chocolate tier\": a special class of studios that, once they get up to around $800,000 in annual revenue, receive a box of fancy chocolates as a gift from Valve at the end of the year. That Gamesradar article mentions an interview Game File (readers may encounter a paywall) conducted with Peak developer Aggro Crab. Co-founder Nick Kaman confirmed Aggro Crab has been itching to join the chocolate-chowing inner circle since it released Another Crab's Treasure , its most successful game before Peak. The team didn't receive a gift from Valve in 2024 despite pulling in the right amount of cash from that game, which stung; when Kaman emailed Valve about it, he got an apology. The team's unrest was compounded by the fact that Aggro Crab shares a building with Mega Crit, the Slay the Spire developer—as you m…",

That being said, I have bad news, #SlorkNation: Valve has melted Slork's wet, slippery body into Sunday dinner. Let me back up. Slork was a hero concept first accessible via console commands in Deadlock's private test. He was later added to the hero labs, a feature where characters with placeholder art could be used to queue up for normal games during scheduled hours, assuming you had a certain number of games under your belt. At this point, Slork had been renamed to the decidedly less hilarious Fathom. Deadlock has spent the last year shifting forms like the MOBA version of an Animorph, and the hero labs mode was removed as the game became increasingly polished and all play was subsumed into a single ranked queue. Four of the eight hero labs characters were added to Deadlock's core roster permanently. The others, including Fathom, were simply removed.

      "body": "When Valorant launched back in 2020, it was pitched as Counter-Strike with added superpowers, a combination that proved irresistible for shooter expert Morgan Park in PC Gamer's Valorant review . Over the last few years, however, the emphasis has gradually shifted to the point where Valorant has turned into superpowers with added Counter-Strike. This problem came to a head last year, with Riot promising to cut back on supplementary utility powers to reorient Valorant back around gunplay. This initiative is set to continue through 2026, with Valorant's latest patch introducing a new gun as Riot promises more extensive weapon reworks in the future. That new gun is called the Bandit, a semiautomatic pistol designed to fill the gap between the silenced Ghost and Valorant's high-powered revolver, the Sheriff. The Bandit gives players a higher rate of fire than the Sheriff and superior damage compared to the Ghost, able to deal instant kills on headshots against lightly armoured players. Riot believes this should add some extra spice to those early, pistol-heavy rounds. While the Bandit's addition is the only major weapon change in the update, Riot says it's indicative of the studio's b…",

But after blasting through both Freelancer's budget and its planned two-and-a-half-year development cycle, Digital Anvil was acquired by Microsoft. Roberts left the company shortly after the buyout—though he remained involved with Freelancer as a creative consultant. Freelancer eventually released in 2003, more than three years later than originally planned. Its cinematic, arcade space combat was generally well liked. But the game was also criticised for being simplistic compared to other space sims—a consequence of Microsoft scaling down the project following their acquisition of Digital Anvil. There's always been a cohort of fans who have wondered what Freelancer might have looked like if Roberts realised his initial vision. Now, a subset of that cohort has just released its own, unofficial sequel to Freelancer, developed over a timeframe that makes the original game's creation look rapid by comparison.

For a quick definition, I think \"save scumming\" is best understood as using a game's save/load feature for anything other than quitting the game and coming back later, or continuing from a game over⁠—no moral judgement here, mind you, just an observation of our tendencies. The incentive to save scum could be argued to be a design failure, or merely a natural function of games as wish fulfillment.

Blizzard calls it The Tower and it's coming in a patch on January 12 as a beta mode that promises to improve over time. It's basically a multi-level dungeon where you slay monsters for a high score, leveraging both speed and power to clear your way to a final boss. Diablo 3 players will recognize this format as an updated version of Greater Rifts, a super endgame mode for players who are pretty much done perfecting their builds. To even the playing field, there are pylons scattered throughout The Tower that give you a big boost in damage when you destroy them. We won't know until it comes out if they're worth playing around, but I think it's Blizzard's way of giving less-than-optimal builds a chance to compete with people who adhere to the meta.

But when's that ever stopped anyone? In the Divinity AMA with the studio, Redditor 'ilikebreadabunch' found the only opening and took it, asking Larian if there's a small spoiler that it could give that won't make any sense until we've actually played the game. Larian obliged, and writing director Adam Smith simply replied , \"Alligator\". Well…uh, that certainly fits the bill. Even if it's a main story spoiler, perhaps a character's final words (that would be an odd choice, I'll admit), good luck getting anything of use from it. With no confirmed release date or even window right now, we'll be waiting a long time before we find out what this clue's all about. I'm grasping at straws here, but perhaps there'll be a fight against alligators, similar to the infamous killer crocs in Divinity: Original Sin 2's opening area of Fort Joy. …",

He's so straightforwardly good as to be, well, maybe a little dull, and he even gets outshone by other characters in some of his own big plot scenes—not because of a deficit in his performance, but because of how those scenes were written. It turns out that Wyll's writer, Kevin VanOrd (who also wrote Lae'zel, by the by), knows just how fans feel. In a Q&A on Reddit , VanOrd wrote in response to a question from a disappointed Wyll-liker that \"I wish Wyll had gotten more content and a more fulfilling arc too.\" Alas, it sounds like circumstances conspired to make that difficult, if not impossible, to do. \"We weren't connecting with Wyll's early access recruitment and initial questing,\" writes VanOrd, \"so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid.\" Way back when, before BG3 left early access, Wyll was a different sort of character and even had a different actor, Lanre Malaolu .

HyperNits boosts brightness by up to 30% while preserving critical highlight detail. Users can choose between HyperNits High for maximum brightness enhancement or HyperNits Medium for a gentle 20% lift in darker environments.\" It's not totally clear, but this very much looks like a similar technical solution to MSI's EOTF Boost feature, as seen in multiple MSI OLED monitors, including and most recently the excellent MSI MPG 341CQR QD-OLED X36 I reviewed a week or so ago.

The problem is that these were effectively two different additional health bars for enemies, weakened by two entirely separate types of damage, and you'd need to break at least one. What this meant is that you were generally much better off having your party focus on either physical or magical damage to break your chosen type faster, rather than using a mixed party and splitting damage between the two types.

      "body": "Call them FSR 4, FSR Redstone, FSR Whatever , AMD's latest generation of AI-enhanced upscaling technologies are definitely a major step forward. Which makes it a great pity that they're not available for older generations of AMD GPUs, like RDNA 3. The just possibly good news is that, in a new interview, AMD has left the door ever so slightly ajar for that happening in future. For many, the frustration is that many of these new upscaling features can be made to run on RDNA 3 graphics and indeed, community-based hacks have achieved just that , albeit with mixed results. So why won't AMD give that effort some official support? Speaking with PC World , Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President at AMD and the guy responsible for various driver features, including FSR upscaling technologies, explained that the lack of official support for the latest FSR tech on RDNA 3 basically comes down to the difficulty in delivering a consistent experience. But when asked if there could be \"an opportunity to make a beta version of Redstone that will run on RDNA 3,\" his answer is at least a little promising. \"That's currently not in the plan, but thanks for the hint. We may want to think about somethi…",

We tend to keep a close eye on Nvidia and AMD for any news about upcoming products, but this year, it was all about AI. I've run the numbers, with a little help from AI-powered transcription, and the mentions of AI are rather staggering. If you thought Nvidia was emperor of AI, think again. The company's presentation was primarily focused on AI and robotics, but it logged a mere 120 mentions of AI during its 91 minute runtime. That's only 1.3 mentions of AI per minute (AI/min). AMD's CES keynote , led by Dr. Lisa Su, hit a staggering 210 mentions of AI. That was over a longer runtime of 117 minutes, though it works out to a much higher 1.8 AI/min. Su really wanted to drive that point home, huh? Now, bear in mind that some Ryzen products have AI in the name. Ryzen AI Max, for example, though only 13 mentions of AI in AMD's show were preceded by the word 'Ryzen'. If you're wondering what percentage of the words spoken were 'AI', and of course you were, here you are: 1.2% of all words spoken during AMD's show were 'AI' 0.95% of all words spoken during Nvidia's show were 'AI' Though neith…",

If you fancy a crash course in how they work and want to build your own from scratch, I have the open-source project for you. Project Patchouli from designer Yukidama is a project to \"build your own EMR tablet from scratch\". As helpfully laid out in Yukidama's YouTube video , an EMR tablet is one that uses Electromagnetic Resonance that sends a signal to a tablet, which is then translated by the tablet. It's a quick and responsive bit of technology, but different pen vendors work off different frequencies, which can impact compatibility. The video shows how electromagnetic pencils have coils and capacitors near the tip; a test board picks up that frequency and uses a signal amplifier to send that information to a computer. With an oscilloscope, Yukidama measures the frequency of each pencil as it touches the board, and then that frequency as they press harder. Two different pens register two different frequencies. This project uses a smart array of coils in the tablet itself, making it \"compatible with most commercial pens from different vendors, offeri…",

Now Videocardz claims the chip will be branded \"Intel Core G3 Extreme\" and have the same iGPU as Panther Lake in laptops. That means the Core G3 will get the same 12 Xe3-spec graphics cores as the top-spec Panther Lake chips for laptops. However, the leak claims that some concessions have been made to squeeze Panther Lake into the handheld form factor. On the iGPU side, it's said that clock speeds have been reduced from the 2.5 GHz of laptop chips like the Core Ultra X9 388H to 2.3 GHz. No doubt the idea is to reduce power consumption without noticeably impacting frame rates. That slight reduction in clock speed has apparently been enough to have Intel rebrand the iGPU from Intel Arc B390 in the top laptop variants of Panther Lake to Intel Arc B380 for the Intel Core G3 Extreme. As for the CPU of the Panther Lake package, that's had a bit more of a haircut. The full-spec Panther Lake configuration in the aforementioned Core Ultra X9 388H has four Performance cores, eight Efficient cores and four Low Power Efficient cores. …",
