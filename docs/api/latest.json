The Zagreus Journey mod adds a third option to your choice of how to leave the Crossroads, a Chaos Gate labeled \"Descend into Nightmare\". Jump inside and you'll be back in Tartarus, with all the old shades and traps to contend with, before working your way up through Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx. Even the original game's soundtrack is carried over. What isn't carried over is Zagreus himself, and so you'll be playing as Melinoë (and whichever familiar you bring), with one of her keepsakes equipped, and encountering the pantheon and earning the boons of Hades 2.

There's an escort mode with a playable civilian class, four-team modes, jump pads, new weapons like the nail gun, dynamite pack, and tranquilizer gun, and more. But that's not the reason for its renaming. As the modders explained , \"Valve requested a few months ago that we rename our mod, because the name Team Fortress 2 Classic was too similar to their Team Fortress Classic.\" \"We've learned that various other mods have recently used the word 'classic' in ways that unintentionally made them look like official Valve products, and as a result, Valve had a new policy put in place back in September.\" Choosing a new name was \"surprisingly difficult\" both because they wanted a name that meant they could retain the TF2C abbreviation, and \"it quickly became apparent that few options actually embodied what we set out to do better than 'classic' had. …",

One that could serve as the perfect ambience for my day-to-day life: working, cooking, cleaning, and unwinding with a glass of wine and my Steam Deck. And what better fodder for my super chill, super relaxing playlist than videogame music? After all, its entire purpose is to create ambience. It's vibes personified. Instead of telling you how it's feeling, it's trying to tell you how you should feel. Ooh, don't you feel so fuzzy and nostalgic as I play the flute in this quaint woodland village? Isn't the sul ponticello on this violin making you scared? You get my point. I have long championed soft piano pieces from JRPGs as the ultimate relaxation music, but I've found myself branching out to some less likely candidates as of late.

When I asked why Cool Shirtz wanted to go ahead with a Minecraft collection, Guthrie said: \"I have such an incredibly deep appreciation for this game, so it felt very natural!

      "body": "Extreme sports sim Descenders Next looked primed to be an impressive follow-up to Ragesquid's 2019 hit, taking the fundamentals which made Descenders' downhill biking such a thrill and applying them to snowboarding and mountain-boarding. PC Gamer's Shaun Prescott took it for a spin last year and came away delighted, stating the sequel\" adopts all of the best qualities of its predecessor while adding something that was arguably missing before: atmosphere\". Yet it seems supporting the sequel has, ironically, represented an uphill struggle for Ragesquid, with scant updates to Next since its early access release in July. That changed this week, however, as Ragesquid implemented a substantial multiplayer-focussed patch, while also explaining what's been going on behind the scenes. \"We're very sorry for taking so long with updates on Descenders Next, and not being able to deliver what we've been promising yet,\" wrote Ragesquid's co-owner Rosie Albers in a Steam post . Albers cited a combination of parallel console development and unforeseen obstacles developing the multiplayer patch as key reasons behind the delay, alongside the broader issue of getting the feel of the sequel right. \"Si…",

One of those is Northgard , a Viking-themed RTS that was released in 2018. Built on traditional strategy foundations, Northgard added novel ideas like game-altering weather systems and a region-based expansion system. The result is one of the best strategy games of the last decade. \"While the inspiration is clear, it would be a disservice to imply that it's mainly trading in nostalgia,\" Fraser Brown wrote in his Northgard review , awarding it a score of 84%. \"This Viking saga builds on the history-themed RTS romps of the '90s, but it's not beholden to them.\" Northgard went on to sell over 5 million copies and receive a bunch of expansions and DLC. Now, developer Shiro Games has bundled several of these additional adventures with the base game to form Northgard: Definitive Edition , which throws in a few new features for good measure. Chiefly, the Definitive Edition combines the base game with the Cross of Vidar expansion, which introduces a new campaign where you must guide your Viking Clan through new lands in a post Ragnarök world.

So popular, in fact, that it's even a surprise to developer ArenaNet. The game's recent remaster, Guild Wars Reforged , launched Wednesday as a free update for existing players and an inexpensive way to get in for newbies. While most Guild Wars fans are on to the game's more traditionally MMO-ish sequel , Reforged still brought the game's concurrent player peak on Steam up to over 5,000 at time of writing, according to SteamDB . That may not sound like a lot, but it's floated for the last several years at around 200-600, and since the game came to Steam relatively late in its life, there's likely a big contingent of people playing on the standalone client available on ArenaNet's website (anecdotally, that's how I play both Guild Wars games when the mood strikes).

      "body": "Tempest Rising developer Slipgate Ironworks has officially introduced superweapons into its action-packed RTS, adding massively powerful instruments of destruction for each of its factions. But when Slipgate revealed its digital WMD's last week, it also hinted there was more big news on the horizon for its Command & Conquer tribute. At the time, I speculated this would be the long-awaited addition of a third playable faction to the RTS, and I was right! Well, sort of. Tempest Rising's third faction is playable now in the RTS, but only in beta, and only for the next two weeks. That third faction is The Veti, an alien race with ancient Egyptian stylings originally encountered in the latter third of the single-player's parallel campaigns. They're radically different from the RTS' existing human factions—the technologically advanced GDF and industrious, inventive Tempest Dynasty—summoning buildings rather than constructing them, and attacking their enemies with laser-toting floating pyramids and ground troops that shoot bees. Slipgate explained how the Veti function in a Steam post , outlining three fundamental mechanics. First, the Veti can convert slain enemies to their side, reanim…",

But the troubled city-builder has received some significant TLC lately. November's bike patch brought bicycles, scooters and associated infrastructure to player-created metropolises, and now, developer Colossal Order has finally added its hotly anticipated asset editor too. As Colossal Order concedes in a recent Steam post , development of the asset editor has been \"long underway\", with the community clamouring for it more or less since the sequel launched. The developer admitted in March that the editor had \"proven more technically challenging than initially anticipated\". Citing issues such as lingering Unity dependencies and the large amount of in-built assets affected by the editor's addition. In any case, those issues have seemingly been resolved. Colossal Order's aim with the asset editor is to let players \"create complex assets on par with official content\", and the tool has a few interesting features to make this easier for players.

Take a look: As we can see in the clip, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) have been running a scam that sounds a bit like the con from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: turn over an outlaw (in this case, The Ghoul) to the authorities (who appear to be the Great Khans, a faction from Fallout: New Vegas) and collect the bounty. Then, while the outlaw is being hanged, shoot the rope and \"use whatever violence necessary\" to kill everyone and escape with both the money and their lives.

A Variety report says Tagawa's death was the result of complications from a stroke he suffered on December 4. Tagawa was a classic 'that guy' actor, with IMDB listing credits in more than 140 films and television shows going back to an uncredited appearance in the 1986 Kurt Russell classic Big Trouble in Little China. It didn't take long for bigger roles to follow: I recall seeing him first in an episode of Babylon 5 (yes, I am a B5 nerd), in which he played a cool, quiet, capable guy who took care of a problem while other people focused on other things—a description that could probably be applied to many of his roles, really. Tagawa appeared in everything from big-budget films to long-forgotten TV series over his long career. In 1987 he was \"Asian buyer\" in an episode of MacGyver and \"Thug in Flashback\" in the low-budget action flick Bulletproof; he also had a speaking role as Chang in The Last Emperor, which won nine Academy Awards that same year. He turned up in everything from Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Walker, Texas Ranger to Planet of…",

Under \"additional bonus rewards\" there's a flail alongside a mace and a glaive, and unless they're giving necromancers a new weapon type, I think we're looking at a clear hint at paladins making their way to Sanctuary immediately.

But only when I made a conscious effort for the first time in a decade to fill up an RSS reader with bloggers, critics, news sources, and even webcomics did I realize that I'd lost track of the original, primal joy of the internet: Clicking a link and finding a whole new world unfurl before me, as fast as my dial-up modem or DSL connection could load it in. I suppose I started taking this experience for granted at some point; once we all came to understand the internet as an infinite repository for knowledge, the obvious goal became accessing that knowledge more efficiently. It's not that I ever really stopped clicking on links. I just stopped putting in the work of looking for websites through directory listings, like the ones I used to love browsing on Yahoo.com for hours at a time ( Home > Recreation > Games > Video Games > Emulation , anyone?).

Netflix is still on publishing duties for Spirit Crossing's mobile release, but it sounds like the now independent Spry Fox is keen to put the game on other platforms too. The Game File article shares a statement from studio co-founder David Edery: \"Spirit Crossing was built to connect the world, bring people together and inspire kindness, so being able to bring the game to as many players, across different platforms, is truly the best thing for the game.\" It seems to be a more peaceable transition than Netflix's sudden closure of Team Blue , which happened before the developer ever released a game.

Unfortunately, as this is part of the Wired Big Interview series, and the larger interview hasn't been published yet, it's hard to fully surmise where Su's stance lies outside of this answer. In its barest form, a bubble is where the asset price in some industry far exceeds actual value, due in part to speculation. The 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble popping didn't mean people wouldn't buy houses or use the internet, but that the value tied up in it exceeded what it was worth, and those betting billions on it could no longer see a return on investment.
