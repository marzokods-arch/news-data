The clip (embedded above) shows Call of Duty pro Simp using one of Blops 7's new killstreak rewards, The Gravemaker, a sniper rifle whose wielder can see, and snipe, through solid walls. The go-to joke is that Activision has given up on combating cheaters and decided to just put wallhacking into the game. I sort of get the indignation, because it doesn't look fun to be on the receiving end of a bullet that was fired through two layers of concrete by someone you never could've seen, but I also sort of don't get it, because aren't all Call of Duty killstreaks like that? How is this less fair than someone calling in an attack helicopter or carpet bombing part of the map? In some of these games you can call in a tactical nuke. A nuclear bomb!

There were the hosts, overflowing with excitement for Black Ops 7's meager alterations to CoD's current form. There were the hyped creators in attendance, many of whose livelihoods are directly intertwined with the success of Call of Duty. And there was Black Ops 7 itself, a back-to-back sequel that not even its developers appear to feel strongly about. It was the pinnacle of videogame marketing excess: loud, abrasive, and insecure. Between extended ad reads for Little Caesars Pizza, AMD, Monster Energy, and Herman Miller chairs, we were treated to Black Ops 7 multiplayer with live commentary that fluctuated between 3 am infomercial and awkward riffing over gameplay that could easily be mistaken for the last handful of games.

      "body": "No good deed goes unpunished in the cynical world of The Witcher. Crossroads of Ravens opens with our young hero, Geralt not-yet-of-Rivia, about to be punished for the crime of rescuing a peasant father and daughter. Multiple authorities take him to task for daring to play hero, all for entirely self-serving reasons, until an older witcher named Preston Holt steps in to save Geralt and position himself as the boy's new mentor. Crossroads of Ravens begins as it means to go on. Chapter two opens with a description of a peasant standing in fresh cowshit to keep his feet warm. It's a book about the mud and muck of its medieval world, one that jams its characters into moral quagmires as well as physical ones. It's a prequel to the Witcher series, set shortly after Geralt finishes his training at the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen under Vesemir and is let loose into the world. He's like a fresh-faced graduate right out of the education system suddenly having to deal with an adult world he isn't prepared for. Will he have to move into a moldy sharehouse and get a part-time job? Well, no. But he is going to meet a semi-retired senior witcher and be offered a mixture of post-graduate tr…",

That's true of the games, anyway, but apparently it's not the case in the books they're based on.

Throw in a bit of redstone, and I'm happy observing others' creativity safely within the confines of my hardware writing lane. One YouTuber called sammyuri has shared an especially extreme Redstone build, building ChatGPT in Minecraft (via Techspot ). Dubbed CraftGPT, this version of the Large Language Model is decidedly compact as far as these things go, featuring only about 5 million parameters (as that's all the creator's \"poor old laptop\" could handle). However, translating that into Minecraft blocks took up a considerable amount of space. Featuring 439 million blocks, this build required the Distant Horizons mod to keep everything on screen and operational. Beyond that, sammyuri claims that this build was made using only vanilla Minecraft's own redstone mechanics.

Both of these laptops have RTX 5090s and cost thousands of dollars. Those bigger batteries are an attempt to get normal battery life out of high-end hardware.

Active players quickly tapered off following the early access launch, with only small spikes thanks to notable updates. But even that seems to have stopped.

The game serves as a semi-autobiographical take on co-creator Jenny Jiao Hsia's adolescent years in the early 2010s—from her final year of high school into college, all while dealing with bog-standard teenage girl woes like dating, chores, an ever-increasing mountain of schoolwork, and dieting. (Image credit: Hexecutable) It's shocking how many parallels I was able to draw between Jenny's experience and my own, both growing up and even now well into my adulthood. The self-deprecation, the ever-piling goals for what is ultimately an unattainable lifestyle, the not-too-subtle comments from family members. Accidentally making dieting your entire personality. While Jenny gets older and her goals shift and grow in number, one thing centres around all of it: food, and eating less of it. Calories are \"bites\" and food are puzzle pieces that have to be slotted together all while staying under Jenny'…",

The Arctis Nova Elite launches today, September 30, for $600/£600/€650. Okay, if you're still with me, let's talk specs. The headset looks a lot like the $325 Arctis Nova Pro —from the swooped back earcups and placement of the ANC and boom arms, to the desktop hub included with both sets. SteelSeries says it teamed up with a designer here, Jakob Wagner, but the external differences appear to be mostly material. Literally—the Elite has a little more metal, including the control wheel on the side, which might explain the added weight. The Elite weighs 380 grams. The Pro, 338 grams. But under the hood, there are some changes. The Elite's drivers are touted as carbon fibre. Rated to the same frequency response as the Pro's 40 mm drivers, 10 - 40,000 Hz, the carbon fibre cans are more sensitive with a dBSPL of 101 to the Pro's 98.

Not paying back that loan could result in the closure of the gaming giant, like what happened with toy chain Toys R Us (via Los Angeles Times ). As reported by the Financial Times , the deal is reportedly betting big on AI cutting down operational cost for EA significantly. EA reportedly has not shouldered huge amounts of debt prior to now, and this could signal a change in business operations. It's not exactly stated how, but the Financial Times report claims that 'people involved in the transaction' suggest AI will boost profits for the company, which will then be used to pay that debt.

In other words, I'm stuck with it until I get a better equivalent to drop. Unfortunately, it has the annoying trait of being…ummm…horny? Every 30 seconds or so, the Cindershelly will let out a moan, call you a worm, or one of many more rather promiscuous voice lines. You could be exploring a vault or listening to a quest—like, perhaps, the Timekeeper invading your friends' brains and threatening you —and your shield will randomly pipe up to put you in your place.

The self-described 'virtual museum' showcases tech from yesteryear, this time exploring Multilink Point to Point Protocol. Dating back to 1994, this far from widely used tech allowed users with too many modems on their hands to combine multiple connections into one, potentially doubling their internet speed. So, why did The Serial port then strap 12 dial up modems together, specifically ? To utilise Multilink PPP and attempt to stream YouTube over multiple 56 Kbps internet connections. After a little bit of maths, the creators worked out that they'd need at least a 182,286 bits per second connection to watch one of their own recent uploads at 240p resolution (YouTube's lowest video quality on desktop) without buffering.

This feeling has returned full-force after seeing a developer kindly explaining the difference between Skill Damage and Action Skill damage on the game's subreddit (thanks, TheGamer ), which probably isn't the place you should have to go for this sort of clarification. Turns out, it's a rectangles/squares situation. Except this is Borderlands, so lead character designer Nicholas Thurston uses guns and shotguns as the metaphor: \"Skill Damage and Action Skill Damage is like Gun Damage and Shotgun Damage. All Skills are skills, but only some are Action Skills. Same as all Guns are Guns, but only some are Shotguns.\" Simple, then. Thurston then explains that Skill Damage impacts basically everything involving the word \"Skill\", including passive skills and traits and, you guessed it, Action Skills. However, Action Skill damage only boosts whatever's on the Action Skill itself. Other modifiers, like Melee Damage and Minio…",

You can watch BigPapaPlump spend 23 minutes explaining the particulars on how the build worked, but the gist is that it involved spamming a skill that infects enemies with poison over and over until the numbers weren't numbers anymore.
