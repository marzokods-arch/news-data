The signature Camera Obscura mechanic, used to capture and fend off spirits, remains a key feature, now offering richer and more engaging gameplay in both exploration and combat. In addition, the new 'Holding Hands with Mayu' mechanic adds a heartfelt touch, letting you experience the deep bond between the sisters like never before.\" While two later games in the series, Maiden of Black Water and Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, have made it to PC previously, this is the first time one of the well-received original trilogy will be officially represented on our platform of choice. It's reportedly the scariest one in the whole series too. Fatal Frame, known as Project Zero in some territories, is about ghosts who can be hurt by taking photos of them. Keep…",

Their most powerful skill is Hypnotic Gaze, which lets them strip opponents of their tackle zones and prevent them using skills like block and dodge. It works on a 2+, rather than 3+ under the old rules in Blood Bowl 2, though it's modified by -1 for each marking player. Hypnotic Gaze is a great way of bypassing blockers and busting cages, but it's balanced by the Bloodlust rule. Every bloodsucker has to pass a test before they act, and if they fail they bite someone else on your team—which is why the handful of useful vampire players have to be bulked out with a mob of thralls who exist just to be snacked on. Playing as the Vampires can be infuriating, as a few bad Bloodlust rolls will see you injuring your own players faster than your opponent can (there's no armor roll for your thralls when they get bit).

The delay is due to director Francis Lawrence's busy schedule, according to an interview with The Direct . Producer Roy Lee didn't reveal much about the film, but hinted at a potentially lengthy wait: \"Well, 'The Long Walk' became a reality because 'BioShock' was delayed for a little bit where we had to do some more script work. And so as the script work is being done, we shot 'The Long Walk,' and [Francis Lawrence] was already committed to doing the next 'Hunger Games' movie. And so it's just waiting for him whenever the 'Hunger Games' is completed, and the script is just being worked on right now.\" Lee was referring to Sunrise on the Reaping, a Hunger Games prequel focusing on Haymitch Abernathy's Games. It began filming this summer and is set to release on November 20, 2026. Francis Lawrence directed all four of the previous Hunger Games films, so it's no surprise he returned for this one.

If you enjoy soulslikes, it's definitely worth giving Fallen Order a try. It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire.

Everyone is being so goddamn annoying . Last Thursday, with Steam buckling and Silksong on everybody's lips, I was at the nadir of my excitement, predicting a sea of perfect 10s that would look embarrassing in a year's time. It seemed like it could be one of those games where, once everything dies down, the consensus becomes \"Yeah, it was pretty good, but we all got way too worked up about it.\" The Bioshock: Infinite special. I didn't always feel sour about the collective Silksanity or its quirky outflows⁠—I still have to put some respect on the commitment of Daily Silksong News , a worthy successor to the Daily Elden Ring Update ⁠—but the final crescendo of excitement, memes, and (worst of all) discourse just chafed my hams: Silksong's hype and anticipation had entered the realm of the absurd or parodical, a performance carried out on Reddit for th…",

Like most sensible people, I long ago wrote off the Postal series as an idea that started terribly, enjoyed some fleeting glory in the same wave of cultural disaffection that brought us Limp Bizkit and the Attitude Era, and has spent the decades since thrashing around in search of relevance. Yet several times over the last few years, I've heard furtive whispers from various corners of the internet that there is one Postal game which is actually, genuinely good. No, I'm not referring to Postal 2 , which despite inexplicably having the same Steam rating as Half-Life 2 , is a pretty shoddy game.

Wirm belongs to the same floppy family of games as Bennett Foddy's QWOP and Getting Over It , a 2D adventure about bypassing obstacles in a form ill-suited to navigating rough terrain. Yet where Foddy's games have an emphasis on challenge, Wirm appears to adopt a gentler approach—more about the low-key joys of being a worm than getting your ass kicked as one. Wirm furnishes you with the full powers of a limbless invertebrate. Your peristaltic locomotion allows you to crawl over most obstacles, and those which cannot be overcome may be, er, undercome by digging through surrounding soil. Finally, you'll be able to embrace that most commonly understood annelid ability—flying through space. I'm not joking. The trailer for Wirm mainly depicts said worm travelling t…",

But Ghost of Yotei co-director Nate Fox poured cold water on such optimism, as hardly anybody employed at Sucker Punch would be interested in reviving Sly Cooper. In an interview with MinnMax (via GamesRadar ) Fox was asked by host Ben Hanson what percentage of Sucker Punch devs would be up for making a new Sly Cooper game, to which Fox instantly responded \"ten percent\".

The original game, which released way back in 2011, boiled down the infamous complexity of the genre into a more accessible turn-based strategy, focussing primarily on tactical manoeuvres and managing supply lines rather than any base building or faffing around with economics. The sequel ingeniously expands and elaborates upon this simple premise, resulting in one of the best strategy games you can play today, and you can get it right now for a tactically sound 85% off. Unity of Command 2 is based upon the same ideas as the original, all about defeating enemy armies using clever positioning and thinking ahead. Your units' attack power is governed not just by their equipment or experience, but their locations relative to the landscape and both friendly and enemy units, as well as their connection to your army's supply lines. Indeed, the supply mechanic sits right at the heart of Unity of Command, dictating your units' ability to function. If an enemy captures one of your supply depots, it will inhibit units' ability to attack and, eventually, move at all. Likewise, if you can sneak behind an enemy frontline a…",

Questline's open-world RPG gives Arthurian legend the Elder Scrolls treatment, letting players explore a decaying, war-torn version of Avalon while guided by the ghost of King Arthur. Tainted Grail's unusual world and intriguing questlines more than made up for a few rough edges, as Sam Desatoff explained in his Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon review . \"Every NPC has something worthwhile to contribute, and most of them offer side quests that add new wrinkles to the larger story,\" he wrote back in June. \"They can also be surprisingly funny: you'll help a nobleman fake his death to get out of a loveless marriage, uncover the lair of an undead chef chasing the next great meal, assist a woman who accidentally turned her husband into a pig, and more.\" Questline has updated Tainted Grail sporadically since launch. But the latest patch— v1.1 —is by far the biggest yet. Not only does it squash a vast array of bugs nibbling at the RPG's underbelly, but it also adds several major features and a bunch of new locations for players to explore. The headline update is a New Game Plus mode, which resets the game …",

The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta.

The studio stands accused of taking a very cool new armor set, which had been intended to be a reward from the returning Iron Banner activity, and instead placing it inside the Eververse Store where it sells for 1,500 Silver per character—$15 in real money. The shambles goes back to September 9, when the Destiny 2 team announced the return of the Iron Banner PvP mode, \"with new weapons to earn and an incredibly cool new set of armor .\" A couple days later, though, Bungie unveiled the new Iron Banner armor and it was in fact \"reprised\" armor , which is to say a reskin of old armor—and not an especially impressive one in the eyes of Destiny 2 fashionistas.

This is even more apparent in Borderlands 4 , with each character having three massive skill trees and associated action skills. It's a lot, and if you make a mistake, you'll need to know how to respec them.. You used to use Quick-Change Stations in previous games, which is where you'd customise your character. Now that you can customise your Vault Hunter wherever you like, through the menu, there's no need for those. Now we have the aptly named Respec Machines. It's different, but sometimes change is for the better. How to respec in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) To reset your skill points in Borderlands 4, you need to use a Respec Machine in any safehouse or faction area , the first of which you'll unlock is at The Launchpad during the Down and Outbound mission , the third in the main story.

After two months in the oven, 1.3 brings all the stuff you expect: bug fixes, tweaks, curtailed crashes, but most importantly—Shadow of Chornobyl and Clear Sky now both have quick slots, just like Call of Prypiat. This is an incredible day. It's morning in the Zone. If it's been a while since you fired up CoP, those are the slots—bound to F1, F2, F3, and F4—that let you quickly use items in your inventory without having to pull up the whole equipment screen and laboriously sift through everything you're carrying. By default, they're set to use stuff like medkits, bandages, food, but you can drag whatever you like in there. It's a small quality-of-life feature, but its absence made SoC and CS just that little harder to go back to in the modern era, and having it across the trilogy is an unalloyed good. T…",

To help matters (or make things worse, depending on your point of view), 2K produced a detailed chart of what settings Nvidia GPU owners should use to get the best performance. However, most of this just involved enabling upscaling and frame generation. Borderlands 4 is just plain hard on your hardware. Especially the CPU, it would seem, because the minimum system requirements demand an '8 core (or equivalent)' processor, citing an Intel Core i7 9700 as an example. Yesterday, I tested a very similar chip , the 9700K, in a rig with a Radeon RX 5700 XT and 1080p Low quality, and the CPU was frequently hitting 100% utilisation in the open world (see below). But what if your gaming PC has a processor with fewer cores, a Core i5 or a Ryzen 5 chip, for example? Does that mean you're going to be in trouble?

You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay. It was kinda fun: I played a few runs, unlocked some upgrades, and experienced brief whiplash after locking eyes with two headlines about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real.

It's well, imminent: Hades 2 hits 1.0 this September 25, or 13 days from now. It'll hit Switch at the same time, should you want to play it there. You might actually want to, by the way, because one of the bells and whistles Supergiant's bringing to the game on the 25th is cross-saves. \"In v1.0, Hades II offers cross saves between the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 versions and the version here on Steam. If you've been playing in early access and wish to continue the journey on Nintendo's game consoles, you'll be able to transfer your save data through a simple in-game menu,\" quoth the announcement post . If you're staring slack-jawed at the headline, swearing up and down that Hades 2 was already out, I don't blame you. The game's been in early access for over a year now, and was already good enough that our Harvey Randall made it his personal GOTY pick for last year. So I have a sneaking suspicion the full release will probably be quite good , and no doubt we'll be along with a review when the game goes full …",
