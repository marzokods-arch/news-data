Prey , World of Warcraft: Midnight's new open-world system, will have bosses attacking you out of nowhere come the expansion's launch on March 2. We spoke with Blizzard game designer Noah Smith, an informal lead on Prey, about what to expect. It's primarily designed for mid-core players, he says: People who like to seek out a challenge in open-world content and the solo-dungeon style encounters of Delves. But the difficulty of Prey ramps up quickly, and top-end encounters should provide challenges even for mythic-geared raiders, should they decide to become the hunted. \"Prey is inherently an overlay system,\" Smith says. \"So regardless of the content you engage with in the open world, you will also be dealing with Prey.\" Pick your target and become the hunted (Image credit: Sykeen / Blizzard Entertainment) Players interact with an NPC in Silvermoon city to pick their difficulty, zone, and target from a collection of 30 bosses. World quests specific to Prey will pop up in the zone, and the area will be empowered with torments that make killing things—for those quests or anything you want to do …",

The lava-filled caves of the Forgotten Kingdom become quite a challenge without equipment upgrades, but the Roblox RPG has the perfect solution for any mining gear woes. The Arcane Pickaxe is available in Stonewake's Cross, but you'll need to navigate through the deepest depths of the first zone's cave to get your hands on it. It's not a quest I'd suggest rushing, even if you help the Bard find his lost instrument early on. The higher level zombies really take a bite out of your HP in bigger mobs. How to get the Arcane Pickaxe in The Forge You can get the Arcane Pickaxe for $125,000 in The Cave, the first zone's mining spot, after completing the Bard's lost guitar quest. It's easy to complete in just a few minutes when you know where to look, but making use of the Bard's Unknown Key takes patience. It's not worth proceeding if you don't have the cash, and I wound up waiting until I was on the last Goblin King quest before going back to buy the pickaxe. It's possible to complete all five without The Forge's best pickaxe, but…",

That might seem like an awfully short window of existence for a major, mainstream videogame, but believe it or not the server shutdown date is actually an extension: WWE 2K24's online features were originally set to be killed on January 5. It's also a fairly standard period of full functionality for 2K's WWE games. WWE 2K23 servers took a piledriver in January 2025 , 2K22 servers ate an RKO in '24, and four pre-2K21 games were put through tables at the same time in 2022. Players can take some comfort in the fact that offline modes will continue to work as usual, so this isn't a Crew-like situation where the game will be rendered completely unplayable.

Behind the scenes, developers at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics were desperately trying to save the project, but these efforts would come to naught: a last-ditch attempt involving publisher Take-Two collapsed when no agreement could be reached over the IP rights . There was also debate over how much of the ace-looking reveal had been smoke-and-mirrors, with one dev angrily refuting the idea there wasn't a game there . Joanna Dark's voice actor Alix Wilton Regan was vocal about the cancellation at the time, and has now given a new interview to The Gamer in which she expands on what had been done on the game, and the \"devastating\" decision to cancel it. \"I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed,\" says Wilton Regan. \"I did not see it coming.

I've often gone on record to defend parrying on this site, despite the haters: Done well, these games are awesome. Parry fatigue? Bah, I say! I get that seeing a parry in every action RPG is getting a smidge wearisome, but if a game's built around timed blocking, rather than just using it as an excuse to ignore balance? It can become a delicious game of rock, paper, scissors that sees you riding a knife's edge between victory and death. Redirecting lightning at the top of Ashina Castle is utterly imprinted onto my memory, nothing else can compare. Anyway, I've been quietly glad to see that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has encouraged people (who'd be otherwise turned off by the secret sauce of 'Sekiro is a rhythm game, actually') to start feeling that beat—including our own video producer Midas Whittaker, who invited myself and hardware writer Jess Kinghorn to wax lyrical about how cool and sexy and hot we all …",

That lasted right up until another discourse (possibly part of the same discourse) that Sandfall Interactive is actually not that small at all. It was, without a shadow of a doubt, the most annoying debate the industry engaged in this year. Yet regardless of how small or large Sandfall Interactive is, CEO Guillaume Broche isn't interested in making the studio any bigger. Speaking to Edge (via GamesIndustry ) Broche explained that he's more interested in making games than bulking out the team. \"I think it's good to have limitations when you're creative,\" Broche told Edge. \"We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves.\" Broche added that expanding the studio would mean more time spent managing it, which isn't what interests him about game development. \"We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep do…",

Yet while this is great for players like me, I can understand why it might be disheartening if you're a developer trying to stand out. One indie developer recently found themselves in such a moment of crisis, to the point where they considered abandoning their project over its perceived similarity to another game. Fortunately, they were pulled out of the spiral, by none other than the creator of the game they'd worried about in the first place. This all transpired over on the subreddit r/IndieDev, on which neophyte indie designer Sbibble relayed his concerns in a post titled \"The game I've been working on for months is exactly the same as a game I just discovered today. What do I do?\" Explaining the situation, Sbibble wrote that he started a new project in October built in the Godot engine which is \"sort of like Enter the Gungeon , but with a spell system like in Noita .\" While aware that the concept \"isn't exactly original\" Sbibble felt the blend of the two ideas lent the game sufficient novelty. Then, while looking through Godot's newsfeed, Sbibble…",

One question put to Kojima ( timestamp ) relates to Metal Gear Solid 2, saying that AI control in the world is \"becoming a reality\" and asking whether Kojima predicted this era. To sum up in a sentence, and obviously spoilers ahead, MGS2 takes a very weird turn in its second half, with 'reality' collapsing around the protagonist Raiden as the player sits through a series of monologues about digital control, junk data, and our inability to parse the bewildering amounts of information created by the modern world. And that's simplifying things. \"MGS2 is often mistaken for a story about AI, but it's about digital society,\" says Kojima. \"MGS1 was about DNA. What isn't left in DNA are memes.

Numerous game developers offered their perspectives on the issue. Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth's director Naoki Hamaguchi stated there is \"definitely a need for that kind of thing\" in games, even if players don't like it, while The Witcher 4's lead designer believed the problem \"isn't necessarily the yellow paint\", but the context in which it was used, and that level designers needed to \"properly weaponise the entire arsenal of your toolkit\" to prevent players from realising that \"'oh, I'm being guided'\".

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . I submit that there's no greater feeling in videogames than finally figuring out how to enjoy a series that once eluded you. Liking games is a skill that you can get better at, and my big skill check of 2025 was learning to love Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4. A copy of the latest Tony Hawk remake fell into my lap because, well, few others at PC Gamer were interested. THPS was once among the biggest series of the late '90s and early aughts, but their legacy doesn't carry as much weight in PC gaming. Nor does it for me: The sole Tony Hawk I owned back in the day was THUG 2, the 2004 successor series to Pro Skater that let you get off the board and run around (which is what I ended up doing most of the time). No, instead I was an annoying Skate fan who preferred to kickflip with the right stick and insisted Tony Hawk was too arcadey or unrealistic. How's it feel to be a mega wrong dummy, teen Morgan?

      "body": "It's strange to think that first-person shooters—and arguably the PC's arrival as a major gaming platform—emerged from an attempt to create the PC's equivalent of Super Mario Bros 3. John Carmack's reproduction of the smooth scrolling effect seen in Nintendo's platformer ultimately led to the founding of id Software and the creation of Commander Keen . In turn this led to Wolfenstein 3D , and ultimately to Doom . Yet as id Software prepared to revolutionise PC gaming, its publisher, Apogee, took the tech id had developed for Commander Keen and made its own take on the 2D platformer. The result was Bio Menace, a platform shooter in which you battle through a city infested with mutants as all-American action hero Snake Logan. Bio Menace was created almost entirely by programmer Jim Norwood, who worked on the Duke Nukem Trilogy and, later, the original Shadow Warrior and its 2013 reboot. Apogee released Bio Menace as freeware in 2005, and it can be played online in various places. But the original has, understandably, aged quite a bit. Fortunately, a remaster just released on Steam, sprucing up this classic blaster for modern players. Developed by Rigel Gameworks, BioMenace Remastere…",

No cars, no luxury pads, not even a Michelin Star meal. Nope, what Beer splashed out on was something a bit more understated: \"A real winter coat\". It's hard not to be charmed by this, just as I was when Zach Adams bought a humble Honda Civic after Dwarf Fortress shifted 800,000 copies. To be fair, he and his wife also purchased a house. But still, these are practical purchases rather than ridiculous spending sprees. Beer says his new coat is \"a luxury that was somehow never important enough, but still something I always wanted\". He spent four years making Super Fantasy Kingdom, and during that time he admits he was \"just living for the game\". He realises this \"sounds horrible\", but he loved it. \"Having such a big goal to slowly work towards, something that has real meaning to you, is such a rewarding process.

A roll of seven when casting Prismatic Spray, resulting in the violet version of the spell, is described as causing blindness (\"WRONG!\" Sawyer hollered over a clip of this moment ).

Talking to PC Gamer associate editor Ted Litchfield, Fallout 3 lead artist Istvan Pely said it was an uncanny sort of fun. \"It's all locations that many people on the team were very familiar with. And we didn't take it seriously. It was fun to just be like, 'Hey, let's, let's blow all this up,'\" he said. \"I felt almost like, 'Wow, we're getting away with this?' It almost seems maybe borderline inappropriate, but it was just kind of silly fun. I guess we were immature enough to just see that angle on it.

Not only have all 12 fights been an absolute joy to play, but the series has some of the strongest identity and cast of characters the game has seen in a good long while. That's thanks in no small part to each fighter having a unique theme song—something that is not afforded to every raid in this game—and I firmly believe the Arcadion series simply would not have hit the same without Soken's excellent and varied musical work on it.

Like most FromSoftware fans, I was resistant to the concept of an Elden Ring spinoff you're supposed to play almost entirely in multiplayer. I also recognised its obvious limitations. Despite being a roguelike all about team interplay, as you use your limited time to accrue as much power and pertinent passives as possible while journeying to battle the Nightlord, one thing stuck out to me: It doesn't have comms. Unless you're playing with friends through Discord, you have to limit your interactions to tagging. Predictably, this leads to endless frustrations and horror stories about incompetent teammates, plenty of which you can find if you peruse the game's subreddit.

Now, one half of Straftat's developers, Léonard Lemaitre, has announced a new game called Vholume , a Mirror's Edge style first-person platformer set in a vast, dystopian city. While Straftat is the easier reference here, Vholume arguably has more in common with Babbdi , which shares the brutalist aesthetic of both Straftat and Vholume.

Vholume seems to be a solo experience too, but one that boasts a far more elaborate movement system than Babbdi.

The first Brutalist Jam occurred in 2022, spawning 35 maps that were bundled together and released as a single mod. A second Brutalist Jam took place the following year, producing 30 more delightfully grey, angular constructions to blast your way through. Both Jams seemed like impressive achievements at the time. But this year's Brutalist Jam blows both previous events out of the water. After kicking off in October, the Quake Brutalist Jam 3 has received a whopping 75 entries created by the Quake community. For context, the original version of Quake contains 37 maps. Why has this Jam proved so much more popular than the previous ones? Well, it might be partly down to word of mouth spreading, and the Jam didn't run last year, which likely encouraged people who feared they missed out to take part this year.

If you were hoping for one of those alien orangutans who are also scientific geniuses I can see how a new character who is basically just the gang punk who gets beat up by the hero in act one of an action movie could seem underwhelming. If you wanted to play a Sister of Battle in full power armor and were instead offered a normal drug addict, I sympathize. The way the Darktide subreddit immediately filled their nappies in rage over the hive scum reveal was a bit much, though. The hive scum wasn't what I expected, but after leveling one up, it's actually a super fun class to play. Maybe \"dual-wielding\" isn't as big a deal as it was in the Rise of the Triad days, but having a character class who can shoot two pistols at once makes clearing crowds deliciously easy.

Early on there's one where you're hurled into a town as it's besieged by the undead, running through collapsing buildings until you can get to a ballista and shoot a shambling zombie cyclops. The next one happens when the magic crystal you're in town to deliver gets stolen right in front of you by a ghoul, and you have to chase it across rooftops in the darkness and rain. To keep up you jump across gaps, clamber up chains, squeeze through windows, and don't fall to your death as timbers creak and collapse beneath you. It's like the chase from Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth only in reverse, because here you're pursuing rather than being pursued and also you've got a snowflake's chance of getting it right first go. The glowing crystal leaves a trail of energy that draws the eye, and you've got a succubus in your head who gives advice like a cacodemon Cortana. Most of the time…",

But those same things are broadly true of Far Cry Primal, a game that probably isn't an immsim, or at least not acknowledged as one by immsim fans. How can that be? Well, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain took to his YouTube channel Monday to try and get down to brass tacks. It might seem like an odd subject for Cain to tackle, given that, as he notes in the video, \"so many of my hundreds and hundreds … of videos are me talking about roleplaying games because that's pretty much all I've made since 1993.\" He has even tried to define \"RPG\" in the past, which seems even harder than defining immsim because there are a hell of a lot more of them.

I liked certain scenes, I liked certain ideas, I liked certain overarching themes; I especially liked the scenery. But the actual moment-to-moment storytelling was so clumsily executed that I was left genuinely baffled. It's a real shame, too, because the changeover from long-time writing lead Natsuko Ishikawa should've been a great opportunity to get some fresh blood into the mix. Ishikawa's been helming the story since Shadowbringers, and she's done a sterling job.

It may not have the delectable, vivid colors of the OLED version, but it was a hell of a workhorse for the price. PC Gamer's Jeremy Laird called it a \" stellar deal \" when the price dropped a few months back and I'm inclined to agree with him; PC gaming has a reputation for its high financial barrier to entry, so to have a handheld option with bespoke UI and docking functionality for under $400 was a pretty wild value proposition (even with consoles on the table).

Some are pretty easy, some are pretty hard, and hopefully some will make you curious to go play something you didn't get around to in 2025.

But occasionally there's a new game that catches my cautious eye: The Finals , Escape from Tarkov , and Stormgate , to name a few. This year, that game was Killing Floor 3 . Actually, it was on my radar prior to this year, because Killing Floor is a series of games very close to my heart. The original wasn't the first game I played on PC—that award goes to either Call of Duty 4 or Team Fortress 2—but it was close. Killing Floor came out in 2009, when I was 14 years old, and I got hooked on it.

The combination was ambivalently received by those who did notice Painkiller's release, with the game receiving a Mixed rating from just under 600 Steam reviews.
