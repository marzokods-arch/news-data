Give a small team of brilliant game designers the remit to make chess with toy soldiers, and I think this is what they would come up with. And yet it is not my favorite Advance Wars. My favorite, Advance Wars: Dual Strike for the Nintendo DS, is more the Chess 2 of strategy games. More units, more powers, combining those wildcard bursts in ways that drag matches out into dizzying swingy battles like games of Risk where someone's turning in their bonus cards every freaking turn . Forget perfect: I loved the bombast of Dual Strike being messily over-the-top, and on a visit to indie studio Area 35's Tokyo office ahead of TGS this week I immediately clocked that its new entry in the Tiny Metal series takes after my one true love.

HoYoverse hasn't even given us a general window yet, so all we can do is speculate and look at some of the developer's historical timelines. Its more recent games, like Honkai: Star Rail and Zenless Zone Zero, saw around two years between their first reveal trailers and their release dates.

I would cackle as the onesie-ed, erstwhile binge watcher slid haplessly down muddy slopes in the least dignified way possible. Sometimes I would just stand still and rotate the analog stick so that he'd do that weird whooshing wormy dance that looks so pathetic. It's fun to make Nate do dumb things and laugh at him. And get a load of his stupid walk. What an absolute loser! If you can imagine, it gets much darker than this. Baby Steps is the bleakest game I've ever played.

You will be able to preorder both the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X as of today, with the standard Ally fetching $600 and the Xbox Ally X costing $1,000. The cheaper of the two devices, the white $600 ROG Xbox Ally comes with a Ryzen Z2 A processor, which offers eight RDNA 2 cores and a boost frequency of up to 1800 MHz. This is almost the same as the Steam Deck , which comes in at half the price, and benefits from the lightweight, Linux-based SteamOS. Not a good start for Microsoft. Up next is the black ROG Xbox Ally X, which has the new Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip in it and comes in at $1,000. This chip was recently benchmarked against the Z1 Extreme , which you will find in the still rather great original ROG Ally X. Despite the upgrade to three Zen 5 and five Zen 5c cores (as opposed to eight Zen 4), the Z2 Extreme only sees a performance uplift of 12% in Cyberpunk 2077 with both machines at 25 W.

Yeah, really. The top-spec ROG Xbox Ally X , meanwhile, is $1,000. Sorry, what? Lest you have forgotten, the basic ROG Xbox Ally runs AMD's \"new\" AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip. Entirely contrary to the implications of the \"Z2\" branding, this is a very elderly SoC indeed. The Z2 A rocks four AMD Zen 2-era CPU cores and eight RDNA 2 graphics compute units. Sounds familiar? It sure does, because those are exactly the same details as the Van Gogh APU (Aerith) in OG Steam Deck circa 2022 and also the die-shrunk version of the same chip in the Steam Deck OLED (Sephiroth) . Of course, Valve has just cut the price of the basic 256 GB LCD Deck to a mere $319 . So, that's twice the price for precisely no additional gaming performance, if you go with the ROG Xbox Ally. Great. For the record, in the UK, that's £499 for the ROG Xbox Ally and £279 for the Deck. Doesn't look much better, does it?

If that weren't enough, its $30 price tag ($26 for preorders) only looks more ridiculous when you consider that the entire mainline series⁠—Deus Ex, Invisible War, Human Revolution, and Mankind Divided⁠— can be had for less than $10 on Steam ⁠. I'm not including Mankind Divided's throwaway DLC or the port of dumpy tablet prequel The Fall in this calculation. Sorry to all five Deus Ex: The Fall fans. The announcement of Deus Ex Remastered made me very sad, a moment of genuine joy and surprise immediately deflated by the piece of work on offer. No one sets out to make a bad game, but I wonder what led to its seemingly sorry state, and if anyone at Aspyr, Eidos Montreal, or Embracer is surprised at the response. It looks like Deus Ex remade in its 2004 sequel, Invisible War, a \"what-if\" Doom 3 mod recreation of the levels, or, indeed, if the the infamous, long-dead Project HDTP was unleashed like a mummy's curse⁠—HDTP may have a genuine claim to being the first laughably bad retro game \"HD texture\" rework.

It debuted the following year with multiplayer maps for Return to Castle Wolfenstein —which, for the record, were excellent. That focus continued through projects including the Enemy Territory games, Brink , Dirty Bomb , and the multiplayer components of Gears of War 4 and Gears 5 . Chinese holding company Leyou acquired Splash Damage in 2016, and was then acquired itself by Tencent in 2020, which is how Splash Damage got there. But it hasn't had much success in the years since: Gears Tactics , released in 2020, was excellent but quickly forgotten, while Outcasters, also a 2020 release, was exclusive to Google Stadia and didn't survive that platform's sh…",

In Unfair Flips, released on Steam today by developer Heather Flowers, you have a coin and a button. The button flips the coin. To win, you have to flip ten heads in a row. Initially, you only have a 20% chance of flipping heads. This is, as the name suggests, unfair. (Image credit: Heather Flowers) It will likely take thousands of flips, and you'll have to manually click for each one. Thankfully, flipping heads rewards you with money. With that money, you can purchase upgrades, increasing the coin's value, your flip speed, your cash combo multiplier, and—crucially—increasing your chance of flipping heads. As the game itself tells you, \"this is the entire game.\" You flip, and then you upgrade your flips, and then you flip until you win. But Unfair Flips isn't really about flipping heads, or incrementally upgrading your odds and income, or stacking combo multipliers for a jolt of post-Balatro dopamine. Unfair Flips is a game about negotiating the temptations of superstition. (Image credit: Heather Flowers) It's a game about the human mind's instinctive drive to find meaning where there is n…",

(For the record, our reviewer liked it quite a bit.) The update has sparked a new round of performance complaints, though, as quite a few players are reporting that instead of being improved, their in-game performance is worse than ever. One of the less-great things about PC gaming is that the nigh-infinite number of potential hardware configurations means that somebody, somewhere, is always going to have problems with a new game launch or update. In this case, though, the problems seem fairly widespread, with reports of diminished frame rates and increased stuttering coming in on Steam , Reddit , and X alike. Some users do say they've seen an improvement in frame rates, or at least that things are more or less the same. But, at least at this point, they seem easily outnumbered by players who say they've encountered the opposite effect. A few players have said clearing the shader cache might help clear up the pro…",

This week's Tokyo Game Show saw another \"Metal Gear—Production Hotline\" livestream, during which Metal Gear Solid: The Master Collection Vol. 2 was announced but not detailed (MGS4 or we riot), and we got a new look at Fox Hunt, a free multiplayer mode being added to Delta on October 30. Fox Hunt is about \"high-stakes, cat-and-mouse encounters\" built around Delta's combat and stealth mechanics. Neatly enough, the name is because you're cast as a candidate member for the legendary FOX unit.

It was almost like the old days—as close as you can get in a modern software-as-a-service ecosystem, at least—and my favorite thing about Battlefield 6 so far is that EA has doubled down on Portal. In Battlefield 6, your Portal 'server' will no longer disappear after everyone leaves , sticking around in the server browser as if it were a proper rental, and the developers have expanded the map and logic editing tools .

It's smart sci-fi with a sense of history: More Dune than Star Wars, more Disco Elysium than Forgotten Realms. The quests feel like short stories from the '70s, Harlan Ellison or Philip K. Dick stuff⁠—there's always a twist, something to really make you think. One that's stuck with me the most is called The Ethics of Eating Flesh. This is ideally the point where you bookmark this page, buy the game on Steam , then come back in 15-30 hours once you've finished the quest. But achievement statistics on SteamDB show only 13% of people who own the game have even done it, and I won't tell anyone that you spoiled it for yourself. Where's the beef?

Living up to its history, the Wombo Combo in Borderlands 4 shoots two barrels at once: One is your standard assault rifle, while the other is a grenade launcher. Saying the Wombo Combo hits like a truck is an understatement, making it one of the best guns for both mobbing and bosses, even without the bonkers splash damage Rafa build . Such power surely comes with a catch, and you're right, it does: it's very easy to blow yourself up with it if you're not careful. Here's what you need to do to get the Wombo Combo.

Well, the company's just announced another swish line of wired gaming keyboards featuring not only Hall effect switches, but also a tiny screen. Because why not, I guess? The Vanguard 96 range is giving me some serious deja vu, in part because the foundations of its design are very similar to the K70 series of keebs (and I reviewed the Corsair K70 Pro TKL last March). For instance, these keebs enjoy the same MGX Hyperdrive Hall effect switches that also featured in that earlier K70 range. That offers not just rapid trigger tech, but also adjustable and dual actuation (leaving my other half to wonder why the keyboard I've lent them keeps doubling up their key presses). The 96 in the name refers to the 96% layout, being a wee bit smaller than a full-size keyboard but still finding room somewhere for its rotary dial and 320 x 170 full-colour LCD screen.

Arriving at the school with Shu and Rinko, you go to the back gate, which leads to a mountain pass—your supposed escape route from the horror that is encroaching on Ebisugaoka—only to find that it's locked. Instead of hopping over this shoulder-high obstacle, which is what I would've done, Hinako and her friends opt to enter the school in search of the key. While Shu and Rinko rest in one of the classrooms, you get voluntold to head out into the school and search for the key so you can escape into the mountains and hopefully outrun all the red spider lilies.

The Raspberry Pi 500+ is a fairly decent update on the previous Pi 500 , changing the basic keyboard for an RGB-toting mechanical setup, doubling the system RAM from eight to 16 GB of LPDDR4x, and fitting an NVMe M.2 slot to the Pi 5's circuit board. This last aspect is the point of note here, because of what software engineer and modder Jeff Geerling chose to do with it. Rather than use it for the intended addition of a small SSD, Geerling took advantage of the fact that the M.2 slot is just a physical interface for a PCI Express connection. That means, with the help of an appropriate adapter, you can stuff pretty much any PCIe device into that slot, and the Pi 500+ should recognise it. In Geerling's case, the stuffing comprised an OCuLink cable, an external GPU dock, a Radeon RX 7900 XT , and a mere 15 lines of ad…",

In less than 24 hours the project was fully funded and met its first two stretch goals: adding fishing, and a group of sentient fruits and vegetables. Not long after, Island Skies began to smash through its remaining stretch goals and exceed its $75,000 goal by $2,489,821, and pull in thousands upon thousands of backers. However, cut to three years later and the project hasn't come to fruition. In fact, the entire brand of Fluffnest is slowly disappearing from the internet. The store in which Fluffnest originally sold their plushies has been taken down, and attempting to access the game's official website takes you to a domain for sale. Basically, it's not looking good for PuffPals: Island Skies. As a result, thousands of backers have started taking to Kickstarter to request refunds for their pledges.

According to Digitimes (machine translated), Intel is reportedly raising the prices of its elderly Raptor Lake chips by over 10%, and \"industry analysts believe the price increase is likely related to TSMC and the lackluster performance of AI PCs.\" Raptor Lake CPUs, of course, do not have AI-accelerating NPUs. The latest Lunar Lake chips have low power consumption and high efficiency, which makes them strong productivity chips (and good for AI) but pretty weak when it comes to gaming. According to the Digitimes report, \"AI PC sales momentum is weaker than expected\", so those running local AIs are less prevalent than otherwise expected. The same is presumably true on the desktop side with the latest Core Ultra chips as with laptop Lunar Lake ones. Effectively, it appears to be seeing customers skip the latest chips in favour of the older ones. Digitimes doesn't note specific chips in its reports, but does clarify that chips selling…",

With PlayStation bringing more of its platform-exclusive games to PC over time, it's maybe not actually that surprising. The Pulse Elevate wireless speakers are a swish bit of kit available in black or white colourways. These speakers also enjoy planar magnetic drivers, built-in woofers, and support for 3D audio.

Uncovered by Tech4Gamers , the AMD patent application explains that modern computing platforms have ever greater memory bandwidth requirements. \"Because the memory bandwidth required for applications such as high-performance graphics processors and servers, which have multiple cores and a corresponding increase in bandwidth-per-core requirement, are outpacing the roadmap of bandwidth improvements for DDR DRAM chips, improved DIMM architectures are needed to meet such requirements with current DDR chip technologies such as DDR5,\" the filing says.

It's primarily an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, where the masked killer Michael Myers hunts down four residents, though this time around there will also be a singleplayer component recreating scenes from the film. This seems to be very much the OG Halloween, with no nods to the many sequels in the first trailer (though I could've well missed some), and is I believe the first game based on the film since a curious Atari version from 1983. There's stiff competition in the horror genre, most obviously from Dead By Daylight (which has Halloween DLC), but Halloween really is a hell of a license: it's the quintessential slasher film, and everything from the killer's look to the stabbing synths has become iconic.

That's the initial impression I got from this mouse: it's trying to innovate in a way that could actually be useful. And now, after spending some more time with it and actually using it for gaming, I'm happy to say it's done so pretty successfully. The selling point here is its 'InfinitePlay' hot swappable battery system. Much like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset , the Glorious Model O3 Wireless gaming mouse can boast a kind of faux-infinite battery life, because you can swap out its 200 mAh battery with another that's kept fully charged, then rinse and repeat, swapping between the two whenever one gets low. You slot an external battery into the rear end of the mouse, then when you see the battery LED on the hub drop to red and the mouse's RGB flash red, signalling battery is less than 30%, you swap it out for the one that's been charging in the hub. …",

That's essentially the enabler for everything else that follows. The 18 cores are all a new third-gen Oryon design that Qualcomm claims was started from a \"blank slate.\" The result is 39% improved per-core performance and 50% faster peak multi-threaded CPU performance.

Oh, and the top chip now has a 192-bit memory bus and supports 4K 144 Hz displays. This is serious stuff. In fact, Qualcomm has introduced a whole new tier of Snapdragon for the top model.

Firing a barrage of homing projectiles, Birt's Bees has quite the sting, but it's made even better with parts like Torgue sticky bombs and a taser underbarrel, which, when activated, breaks the damage multiplier of stickies. However, Birt's Bees is one of the few legendaries locked behind side content, so if you haven't been thoroughly exploring Kairos, then you've likely glossed over the boss you need to farm. Thankfully, you can work towards it very early on. Plus, it's also where you get the Kickballer , so you could end up with not one, but two incredible legendaries for your effort.

Forza Horizon is back, baby, and it's heading to Japan. Forza Horizon 6's teaser didn't give much away, mostly just showing a bunch of licence plates from the countries the series has raced through, but how could I not get excited by the end, when we see Mount Fuji? Sure, Forza Horizon 4 will always have a special place in my heart, since it made Blighty the star, and even let me drive around my old university haunting grounds in Edinburgh. There's nothing quite like playing a game and being able to point out a specific set of steps you once puked up on because you were 19 and couldn't hold your whisky. But Japan is an equally tantalising prospect, with its extreme terrain, densely-packed cities and striking vistas. Forza Horizon is always a looker, and I can't wait to see what Playground Games does with the new setting. And, of course, Japan is a serious car country, boasting lots of manufacturers as well as a vibrant racing scene. There's a lot more to it than Tokyo Drift. \"For a long time, Japan has been top of Horizon fans' wish lists, so …",

That's per a news story by Famitsu (thanks, Automaton ) discussing its upcoming October issue. Relieving me of a bit of my embarrassment is the fact that the magazine itself also seems surprised, here's a quote (via machine translation): \"Surprisingly, this game does not have what is known as a 'character gacha,' and basically, you can get all of the playable characters just by playing the game. Seriously?! … So, what are the in-game elements that require payment? Mainly the parts that allow players to customize their clothes, vehicles, homes, and more to their liking.\" In other words, this isn't a Genshin Impact—it's just shaping up to be a solid open-world, free-to-play RPG with cute outfits and furniture you can buy with money.

I'll admit, I don't really see the appeal of simulating an activity one could also readily engage in—so imagine my confusion when I heard about Deutschland's remote robotaxis. In the now-defunct Tegel airport in Berlin, drivers take to impressive driving simulator rigs to remotely control cars up and down the runway (via The Guardian ). Pressing pedals from hundreds of metres away, the remote drivers monitor car movement over a video feed captured by four cameras on each vehicle's roof. These remote drivers' setup is giving me serious rig envy. Many of the picks in our best PC racing wheels guide are swish, but the setup here is a cut above even that. Besides monitoring car movement on a generously sized triple monitor setup, the remote drivers also enjoy the plush cups of what appears to be the Logitech G430 wired headset.

I couldn't do it. My Yakuza journey ground to a halt. From the hands-on time I've had with Kiwami 3, it's a remake that doesn't reinvent the original, but—like the two Kiwamis before it—polishes it to a shine, bolts on some fantastic new nonsense in substories and activities, and acts as a glitzy refresh for a generation that, perhaps, didn't get to it back in 2009. Meanwhile, Dark Ties—a bonus Gaiden game releasing with Kiwami 3 that has you play Yakuza 3 villain Yoshitaka Mine—acts as the wholly new red meat to draw in those of you who already know Okinawa like the back of your hand. (Image credit: Sega) But don't let me undersell it: Kiwami 3 looks absolutely gorgeous and plays wonderfully. It just, you know, does those things much in the same way Kiwami 2 did.

A good example of a mod that was not created to solve a practical problem is Epic's Skibidi Toilet , which creator EpicNNG said was made specifically \"to spite Samuel Winkleclank.\" That would be Borderlands 4 narrative director Sam Winkler, who apparently brought this upon himself by saying Borderlands 4 would cut back on the \"toilet humor\" of Borderlands 3 . \"If the word 'skibidi' ships in the game under my watch I'm gonna cry real tears,\" Winkler proclaimed fatefully.

Others on the team didn't experience this bug, but I saw it pop up all the way through my time in haunted Ebisugaoka. Turns out my habit of switching off motion blur without even thinking about it whenever I see it in the options menu is the problem, which I wish I'd known 20 hours ago when I started the game. Leave motion blur on and apparently you'll never experience this particular glitch. You will have to put up with cutscenes locked to 30 fps, and a stamina-based combat system, and weapon durability, and one particularly daft twist, but there are people out there who like each and every one of those things.

However, the Disco Elysium comparisons don't seem to apply to protagonist Hershel Wilk, who appears to be a relapsed spy called back in to assemble a squad. I don't think that you'll be waking up hungover and naked in your hotel room at the start of Zero Parades. Hershel, the two off-screen characters in the State of Play trailer explain, hasn't been around for five years, but is still considered one of the best. That doesn't mean she won't get into trouble. There's a scene where she's being interrogated while strapped to a chair and getting up to some hijinks around the city wearing a rectangular mascot's jiggly head.

I realize Logan has razor-sharp claws that snikt out of his hands, and his whole deal is using them to cut people up into multiple pieces. I also know a couple of the Marvel movies have gone deep into R-rated territory and shown him popping his claws through people's domes. I somehow just wasn't expecting the game to be quite as graphic as it is. Like, so many people are stabbed right in the head in the trailer. Not just in the head, but in the face . I read X-Men comics as a kid for probably 10 years, and Wolverine killed plenty of people in them, and I even remember a miniseries of comics where he definitely put his claws directly through a dude's face. But I feel like that was somewhat of a rare occurrence. He'd slash people up, sure, but it was rarely all that bloody on the page. I'm not complaining, I'm just a little taken aback, possibly because Insomniac's Spider-Man games are pretty PG, right?

      "summary": "But will it be better than the mods?",
      "body": "At Sony's State of Play today, Eidos-Montréal and developer Aspyr announced that a remaster of classic immersive sim Deus Ex is coming to PlayStation 5 next year. There's no mention of Xbox or PC versions in the trailer, but we've confirmed separately that Deus Ex Remastered will also come to both platforms. On PC, it'll be available on Steam, and there's a store page up now. As beloved as Deus Ex is on PC, I wonder if this will be bigger news for the console crowd. Deus Ex is a PC classic through and through, and as such, fans have kept the original fresh themselves with mods. GOG will supply you with fan overhaul Deus Ex: Revision , for instance. The official remaster will feature \"new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,\" according to a post from Aspyr on the PlayStation Blog . They've also rebuilt the character models, added lip-syncing to the dialogue, and thrown ragdolls into the mix. (I'll basically never say no to ragdolls, so sure, why not?) In a press release, Aspyr and Eidos-Montréal also noted a few quality of life additions: Deus Ex Remastered will include \"autosaves, faster loading, achievement tracking, and cloud saves on supported pla…",

The change was acknowledged in a message posted on Aspyr's support site (via Time Extension ) saying that a hotfix was released on September 19 \"to address unauthorized AI generated content.\" \"We've addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content, while retaining the improvements made in the previous update,\" Aspyr wrote. \"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Please reach out to our customer support site with any issues.\" It's a quiet conclusion to an ugly issue: French actor Françoise Cadol complained in August that a patch for the remasters of The Last Revelation, Chronicles, and Angel of Darkness replaced some lines in the game with AI-generated content, without her permission. Lene Bastos, the Brazilian Portuguese actor for the games, subsequently made a similar claim in a video posted to Instagram ; a couple weeks later, Bastos said she'd received an apology from Aspyr, who pinned the…",
