As the holiday season rapidly approaches, I find my mind turning to gaming's many winter wonderlands. Over the years, we've been treated to countless beautiful icy landscapes to explore. Sure, they're usually full of people (or monsters) that want to kill us, but that doesn't make it any less charming to get to play in the snow without getting cold. Now's the perfect time to look back on some of our favourites—so I thought I'd put some together in a very chill little quiz. All you have to do is look at the screenshots of various wintery locations, and tell us which game each one is from. Simple as that, and in the spirit of Christmas generosity, I've even made it start out nice and easy. Though you might find as you go along that the later questions are snow joke… Let us know how you did in the comments—and your favourite snowy videogame location!",

Ah, the pick-up group (PUG).

Enter the group/party finder, saviour of daily reward loops—you get matched with strangers, rock up into a dungeon, and hope to god that they are at least passably good. And for the most part, they are. MMOs have understood for a while now that casual content shouldn't be a sweatfest, and as long as everyone's mostly pushing their buttons? You'll be okay.

This week, Harvey goes home (in MMORPGs). As World of Warcraft : Midnight gears up, Blizzard's released its player housing early for those who've pre-ordered the expansion—I won't wax poetic about the system (even though it really is quite good) instead, I wanna talk about player housing in general: Why it's good, what it means, and how it relates to the broader ecosystem of MMORPGs as a genre. Because it really is crucial, even if it did take Blizzard 21 bloody years to get with the program. MMOs are, in a lot of ways, about expression. In ye olden days of the internet, there was (and still is) a game called Second Life —this game is pretty much built on top of player-submitted stuff. Custom avatars, and, more to the point, UGC residencies that take place on a \"grid\". Crucially, the thing has straight-up 3D modelling software in it, meaning players can not only look however they'd damn well please, but they can also create spaces for themselves, too.

Those familiar with the GTA 4 modding scene will likely have tried the suite of broken bike 'em ups that've graced the gritty streets of Liberty City, but in this instance, creator Shvab has thrown themselves into GTA 4's ageing vehicle logic, disabling engine health, bypassing fuel-tank explosions, and preventing NPCs from trying to 'start the engine' on a literal bicycle. There's even a custom IK system so Niko's feet land properly on the pedals. As Shvab puts it: \"I wanted it to feel like GTA 4 always meant to have bikes—not like some clunky workaround.\" The mod is open source too, which means Liberty City's most chaotic engineers are already plotting upgrades.

The polished but walled off demo made it hard to tell how much of Phantom Blade Zero was finished, and it seemed equally possible that it would be arriving in early or late 2026. In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one. The release date trailer shows off quite a bit of Phantom Blade Zero we haven't seen before, including at least a couple boss fights and characters related to the story, which S-Games has so far mostly avoided showing.

      "body": "The Epic Games Store's Holiday Sale is now underway—it actually started on December 11 but we were a little busy with other things you may have heard of—and that means, aside from deals, a whole bunch of new free games to pick up. First on the block is a very big one indeed: The hit Harry Potter sim Hogwarts Legacy , which is yours for keeps if you claim it before December 18. Hogwarts Legacy is the proverbial problematic fave: As PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde laid out in 2023, there was quite a bit of controversy when the game first launched over whether or not it was okay to play it , thanks to the notoriously anti-trans politics of author JK Rowling. Rowling wasn't involved with the development of Hogwarts Legacy but she does profit from it, and some portion of her money goes to support anti-trans organizations . But Harry Potter remains much beloved, and Hogwarts Legacy was and still is a hit: Nearly three years after it launched, there are currently more than 18,000 people playing the game on Steam alone . Unsurprisingly given that fact, the price remains pegged at the original $60. That makes Epic's giveaway—the first time Hogwarts Legacy has gone on the freebie block—a very attrac…",

But there were some notable absences: Studios we haven't heard from in awhile, announced projects due for a check-in, even rumored games that seemed a shoo-in for an official reveal. These are the nine biggest MIA games and studios from The Game Awards 2025. Blade Copium Status : Blade is probably just getting some beauty sleep in his coffin. If you tuned in to this year's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted on December 4 (and you should have!), you may recall a devilishly handsome and well-informed games journalist explaining why Arkane's Blade adaptation is our 16th most anticipated upcoming game . We're about due for more details, even a gameplay trailer⁠—we last got official word from Arkane Lyon at the 2023 Game Awards with Blade's debut teaser. No reason to panic, though: While I was expecting a repeat TGA appearance, we might see Blade at Xbox's summer showcase, or even sooner if it does another January stream like it did this year.

The bottom-most layer, also known as the front end according to MIT, comprises the transistors of the chips (or capacities, in the case of DRAM).

Last week I was: Recommending you go be cringe in World of Warcraft . It is 2019: Larian is announcing its new RPG , Baldur's Gate 3 . The studio releases a short, cinematic teaser with an emphasis on body horror—the ceremorphosis of an unwitting guard rendered in horrible, gory detail. Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh. But on the whole, Baldur's Gate 3 is a bright heroic fantasy with bloody dark spots—it's a colourful, lively game that (unless you kill everybody) is about troubled people overcoming their worst nature and horrifying fates to save the realm. The body horror in that original trailer is a theme, but it's on…",

Specifically, Altman signs his latest blog post off with these comments: \"Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I’m really proud of the trajectory the team has us on. We are seeing tremendous benefits in what people are doing with the technology already today, and we know there is much more coming over the next couple of years.\" It may seem convenient, trite, and not a little facetious to use PC gaming as a prism through which to view OpenAI.

The technology came out when I was still in school and today I'm at an age where buying a motor vehicle could be described as a midlife crisis. No, PhysX hasn't been relevant for a while. Or so I thought… Earlier this year, Nvidia pulled support for 32-bit CUDA applications with its newest generation graphics cards, the RTX 50 series. With it gone, it's no longer possible to natively run 32-bit games with hardware-accelerated PhysX effects. Why that matters: PhysX offers a way to run some in-game physics calculations on an add-in card . That not only frees up the CPU to focus on other things, it also allows developers to put a lot more physics-based effects into their games. As such, games with PhysX effects tend to have a lot of stuff going on. If you run a game with PhysX enabled but without the hardware to accelerate it then all of the physics calculations fall on your CPU. Even on today's much faster processors, with many more cores than those around during PhysX's peak, the impact of these added effects severely limits frame rate. The CPU becomes a bottleneck. Or you turn PhysX off. Now, I'll admit, I hadn't thought about Ph…",

I've dubbed it 'aggression-based matchmaking', and it's the phenomenon that players have noticed for quite some time now, where those who don't engage in PvP get put in chill lobbies, whereas players who shoot on sight get placed in super aggressive lobbies. (Image credit: Embark) I first noticed this a few weeks ago. For the most part, I had been very chill in solo lobbies, just going in to loot or even team up with strangers to take down bigger arcs. It was a great experience, and the sense of camaraderie here was unmatched. But then, on one fateful day, I decided to shoot someone in a solo lobby. I ended up killing them, and my fate was sealed. From here on out, everything changed. I'd get shot in the back of the head before I even clocked another raider.

The cryptocurrency boss oversaw the collapse of TerraUSD and Luna in 2022, which the judge described as \"fraud on an epic, generational scale.\" \"In the history of federal prosecutions,\" US district judge Paul A. Engelmayer said during the sentencing (via CNBC ), \"there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have, Mr. Kwon.\" TerraUSD and Luna collapsed in May 2022. TerraUSD was a so-called stablecoin for its intrinsic tie to the value of the US dollar. Intended to always be valued at $1 per coin, the foundations of the stablecoin were complex and shaky. It relied on protocols, a separate counter-token called Luna, and an exchange for burning/minting tokens to maintain the price of TerraUSD at $1. Failed attempts to prop up the system and mislead investors using secret funds eventually led to the collapse of both TerraUSD and Luna, from $1 and $87 on May 5, to $0.2 and $0.00005 on May 13 . \"In fact, core Terraform products did not work as Kwon advertised and were manipulated to create the illusion of a functioning and decentralized financial syste…",

Developer Sandfall Interactive is so happy, in fact, that it just decided to do the developer equivalent of blowing a kiss: The \"Thank you\" update —that is literally what it's called—adds a bunch of content to the game for the low low price of 'nothin' but disk space', as seen in the trailer below. The full patch notes go into greater detail—I'll rattle off the smaller bits first before we get into the real meat, but to summarise: There's a photo mode, now; You can save \"up to 50 different lumina loadouts\", which is a tremendous quality of life improvement, and there are new filters for them. Lastly, you can abandon battles, rather than simply waiting to die if you messed up. I cannot understate how hyped I am for that lumina loadout detail. I'd estimate a good four to five hours of my 67 hour playtime in Clair Obscur was spent just messing around with my pictos in menus—and it was always agony when a singular fight forced me to custom-tun…",

The trailer features VO from (presumably) some manner of fucko alien complaining about how namby pamby, politically correct, Empire-era emissions and engine size standards ruined speeder racing. But now with the antiwoke New Republic and its gutting of the relevant regulatory bodies, we're returning to \"massive engine, lightning fast, lives on the line\" speeder races. Speeder racing's inevitable reckoning with driver mortality aside, the racing in question looks sick as hell, with a real sense of speed and great use of scenic Star Wars vistas throughout the trailer. I mean, your graphics are certainly pretty enough: Get the handling right, and bing bang boom, that's a Star Wars racing game I'd play. What will really seal the deal for me is some kind of campaign or otherwise toothsome singleplayer structure, which remains an open question at the moment.

Kind of in the way two guys with meticulously groomed moustaches will give a knowing nod when they walk past each other in the street. Upon watching arcade racer Screamer's latest narrative-focused trailer at The Game Awards, the first thing I thought to myself was, \"Huh, this absolutely feels like a fighting game.\" A tournament bringing unlikely individuals together in the pursuit of a larger, evil entity? Conversations spanning multiple languages, yet everyone seems to understand each other? Teams of three, not unlike a certain King of Fighters? Turns out my vibes were not misplaced, if chatting with game director Federico Cardini is anything to go by. Milestone's \"love of Japanese animation and fighting games\" did a lot of heavy lifting in influencing Screamer's story and overall tone. \"I am personally a Street Fighter player,\" Cardini tells me. \"Our creative director, Michele [Caletti], is a super fan of King of Fighters. And then our QA people are the Tekken guys. We also like BlazBlue, Guilty Gear —we really like them. Even the weird ones…",

A game developed as the PC's answer to Namco's Ridge Racer before its sequel delved more into rally racing. The new Screamer—set to launch next year—has a very different vibe to its '90s predecessors. Peeled away from more realistic pastures for a neon-lit anime bonanza, heavily-modded cars and the unusual decision to put narrative at the centre of its arcade racing. On paper, it looks wildly unlike the games that came before it. But as Game Director Federico Cardini tells me, Milestone hasn't forgotten its roots. I asked about some of the more negative reaction to the revival, namely from people who played the originals and weren't happy with the new direction. \"I completely understand their opinion,\" Cardini said. \"It's something we ourselves struggled with at the very beginning. But I can assure you that we have decided to do this while keeping in mind the essence of the original Screamer, which was a very fast racing game with a lot of adrenaline in it, in every race.

Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve will release on Steam in 2026, and of course PlayStation and Xbox consoles.",

But the best of those reveals is a distant second in the running for The Game Awards' best moment, because in the middle of the show, Werner Herzog appeared to explain Warframe to the crowd. If all you know about Warframe is that it's a game with space ninjas, the relentless Wagnerian intensity of a Herzog monologue might feel like a strange fit. But Warframe is beautifully, uncannily strange. As Herzog says during the magnificent work of advertising, Warframe is a story about beings \"cursed to walk this senseless universe in living metal, haunted by dreams.\" Warframes are an open question about identity, humanity, and utility. They are a riddle cast in razor iron and warped, quivering meat. They are weapons 3D printed from muscle memory, psychic imprint, and arcane force. They can get pregnant.
