      "body": "If you have an Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, or ASRock motherboard, you need to update the BIOS if you want to continue playing Valorant. That's because a critical flaw was recently found that allows cheaters to bypass hardware-based security checks and potentially inject code before Riot's Vanguard anti-cheat can wake up. As laid out in the Riot Games blog (via Tom's Hardware ), Valorant relies on IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) to check the ID of your memory and only allow greenlit devices to get access. In the BIOS/firmware, your motherboard has Pre-Boot DMA Protection, which uses IOMMU to prevent a rogue device from accessing your system as it boots up. This means, once you're into the operating system, your device assumes all is good and continues as normal. The blog post says, \"In some cases, hardware manufacturer firmwares incorrectly signaled to the operating system that this feature was fully active, when it was actually failing to initialize the IOMMU correctly during early boot.\" This means someone getting in before those security functions boot up can effectively bypass the security, and \"by the time the system is fully loaded, it can’t be 100% confident that 0 inte…",

At the same time, it also revealed that the new operating system would be home to another major software release: DirectX 12 . It's been a decade since both were officially released, but while Windows 10 has been shuffled off into the realms of 'end of life' support, DirectX 12 has grown to become the most comprehensive collection of graphics APIs ever created. To celebrate this fact, Microsoft has published a short blog detailing some of the major improvements and upgrades that DirectX 12 has enjoyed over the years. For some folks, especially those who have been involved with PCs for as long as I have, it will only seem like yesterday when the new API was let loose. However, ten years is a long time in PC gaming. For example, back in 2015, Intel's four-core i7 6700K was the best gaming CPU you could buy. Since then, however, not only has Intel released nine further generations of chips, with the most recent sporting up to 24 cores, but the processor of choice for discerning gamers has switched to being an AMD one.

The publisher, Humble Games, still technically exists, but it's dormant, with a website that proudly announces the launch of Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus as if it happened yesterday, even though it released in July 2024. (The pay-what-you-want Humble Bundle store is still around; both it and the publisher are owned by media company Ziff Davis.) Things turned out relatively well for Bō, which has a \"Very Positive\" rating on Steam with over 1,000 user reviews and just got a big free update . But when Stair opened that matter-of-fact email in a Kyoto hotel room and learned that everyone he'd been relying on to manage the launch was no longer employed, the stress was tremendous.

But the upcoming Queen's Domain deserves to be raised up from the crowd. We recently featured Queen's Domain in the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted showcase, and its aesthetics really caught my eye. Everything's all crunchy and dithered, but the art and assets are clearly gorgeous and well-crafted underneath⁠—we're very deliberately lo-fi here, not just 'cuz. In addition to the genre-standard medieval/renaissance gear and guys, Queen's Domain zags a bit by setting the game on a tropical island, with ancient, mossy stone ruins that call to mind Mayan cities or, in videogame speak, the Ruins of Rauh from Elden Ring.

Intergalactic was revealed at The Game Awards 2024 with a long cinematic that landed (for me, at least) as kind of a mashup of Uncharted with Ready Player One, in space: Porsche-branded ship, Sony audio player, anime on the TV, and Pet Shop Boys on CD. Studio boss Neil Druckmann later said the game, despite its clear action trappings, is \" about faith and religion ,\" which is an interesting pitch, but we really haven't heard anything about it since.

Even at a young, tender age, I admired the rarity of a game that celebrated the simple act of observing creatures in their natural habitat instead of attacking them on sight. I'm all for fighting fake creatures, of course—I wouldn't have spent a decade scrapping lizards for their parts in Monster Hunter otherwise. But sometimes it's just nice to look. Pokémon Snap did have a problem, however: Professor Oak thought it was fine to pay with exposure. No matter how many valuable shots of Pikachu I sent him, it didn't put any cash in my pocket that I might have spent on cool hats or shirts. Thankfully, there's finally a game willing to properly reward my talents in wildlight photography: Flock Around, a multiplayer photography game that brings friendslop a Peak-like experience to birdwatching. (Image credit: Secret Plan Games) After firing up the Flock Around demo on Steam and customizing my genre-standard colorful beanshaped avatar, I soon learned something about birds: They're harder to photograph than Pokémon.

In a new effort to set the record straight, Vincke said today that Larian will hold an AMA in the new year, giving gamers an opportunity to learn more about how developers at Larian actually get things done. Larian's AI controversy erupted earlier this week in the wake of a Bloomberg interview in which Vincke touched on some of the ways developers at the studio are making use of generative AI tools. He made clear that the studio isn't using generative AI for any in-game content, like art, writing, or voices, but that did little good: The backlash against what was perceived as Larian's pro-AI stance was immediate and fierce. Vincke tried to smooth things out with a subsequent post on X in which he was more specific about how exactly Larian developers use generative AI, but that did not satisfy many of the studio's fans. So now the plan is to let the developers themselves jump into the fray…",

      "body": "Just one week after a new trailer for the upcoming Mass Effect-alike Exodus was unveiled at The Game Awards, a Bloomberg report says James Ohlen, the head of developer Archetype Entertainment, has stepped down. The change comes as part of what appears to be a shakeup of gaming efforts at Hasbro, which has brought in industry veteran Paul Della Bitta to head up Wizards of the Coast's Digital Ventures division. Della Bitta spent 10 years across two stints at Blizzard, as well as two years as general manager of Riot Games in North America. More recently, he was a co-founder of Dreamhaven , the developer and publisher headed up by former Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime. But it's the departure of Ohlen that strikes me as the most notable development here, at least from a gamer's perspective. A 22-year BioWare veteran with lead design and director credits on everything from the original Baldur's Gate to Anthem, Ohlen took the wheel of a then-unnamed new development studio at Wizards of the Coast in 2019; Exodus, the studio's first project, was revealed at The Game Awards in 2023 . But just two years later, Ohlen is out. \"At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and …",

      "body": "Well, that didn't take long: Diablo 4 players have cooked up a completely automated build for the new paladin class that involves walking your dogs around while surrounded by a ring of fire. Never again will you need to burden yourself with pressing buttons once you get this build going as it's powerful enough to do everything in the game. Nobody has decided on an official name for it because it utilizes a bunch of different skills, but it's technically an \"auradin\" build like the ones you'd see during the days of Diablo 2. However, I propose that we start calling it the aura farmer build because the engine running everything is a holy aura that burns nearby monsters when you have a unique pair of gloves on. What's better than a single holy aura? 11 holy auras, obviously. In addition to surrounding your character, you can summon a pack of wolves and an ally mercenary who will inherit the aura too. Now, you have a whole team of aura farmers that leave a trail of ash in their wake. Outside of pushing into the high tiers of Diablo 4's hardest dungeons, this build only requires you to walk into enemies. There are buttons you can press to increase your damage, but they're optional. In …",

Care's tournaments, which the Mie prefecture-based organization has been running since 2019, feature rosters of senior citizen competitors in an effort to promote elderly social and mental wellbeing by creating \"an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in esports,\" according to its website . Currently, Care hosts its tournaments in Japan's Mie, Gifu, and Aichi prefectures, but the organization hopes to someday organize nationwide competitions. Livestreamed on Care's YouTube channel, the tournaments feature professional broadcast production with live commentary.

The project leader Viktor Tóth said at the time he wasn't happy with how they'd implemented the shooting response, and four years later the team is back with a new setup that significantly expands what the rats can do ( first spotted by Tom's Hardware ). And this time, the rodents are rocking a trigger mechanism. The first version had the rats suspended in a harness over a ball that rotated when they moved, with that movement mapped to a simplified version of a Doom corridor with an imp at the end. When the rat did the right things, it would get a reward in the form of sweetened water. The limitations meant that it was a bit of a stretch to say the rats were playing Doom, but as Tóth said you could make a decent argument they were \"kinda\" playing Doom. The new setup still maps the rat's real-world movement into a Doom environment, b…",

Maybe that's the best compromise: Blueprints have felt pretty stingy in Arc Raiders since launch. I've played for nearly 50 hours and haven't managed to find more than seven—to be fair, I'm not looking all that hard, but it's strange that other rare loot (like fancy guns and gadgets) are significantly easier to find than the blueprint for items that aren't even that good, like muzzle brakes.

So this just made perfect sense for the region that we'd be expanding into, and the reasons why the region is that way. It really fit well with what we had.\" (Image credit: Bethesda) This new area of the Wasteland is indeed inspired by the sandy slopes of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 , with the pillars being \"desert, deathclaws, and raiders\" , which also coincidentally ties in with Fallout season 2 on Prime. \"We set this up in a way so this new area goes along with the show a little bit,\" LaCoste says. \"We just wanted to expand in a different direction, you know.

According to a report from Rest of World , the optimal temperature range for a data centre lies between 18 °C and 27 °C (or 64.4 °F and 80.6 °F).

Furthermore, 600 (or about 10% of all data centres) have been built in places that regularly breach that temperate 27 °C ceiling (via Tom's Hardware ). Data centres are already power hungry, collectively hoovering up 1.5% of the world's total electricity consumption (or 415 terawatt hours) in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency .

Nonetheless, over almost three decades of irradiated exploration, some standout missions have emerged. Most are potent displays of the genre's potential for reactivity—tales which allow for creative approaches, and multiple outcomes you'd never uncover without a spot of wiki-diving. Others are memorable simply because they're odd: creepy, daft or moving, written in a distinct tone that stands out against the green-grey backdrop of wasteland America.

That weird, huge, mushy mutated monster in the giant spice tank with a whole posse of bald dudes dressed in garbage bags vacuuming up the Navigator's, I dunno what the slop is it's leaking… tank sweat? It rules. The third-stage Guild Navigator is the best and weirdest part of a very good and very weird movie. And yet, Denis Villeneuve has now made two Dune movies, and we still haven't seen his version of the third-stage Guild Navigator. Since Dune: Awakening is based on Villeneuve's Dune movies, we haven't seen a third-stage Guild Navigator in the game, either. (Image credit: Universal Pictures) This is, frankly, a crime against casual Dune fans like myself. Look at it this way: I just paid Amazon $3.79 to rent it so I could check, and in Lynch's Dune movie, the Guild Navigator shows up precisely at the 8-minute mark . …",

Sounds spicy. Before you envision yourself building new bases at far flung locations, the new maps are not \"anywhere near the size of like the Hagga Basin,\" Bylos said. \"They're smaller one-kilometer-by-one-kilometer maps in size, and they contain very specific activities.\" Building bases isn't one of those activities, but players will be able to complete \"combat missions, sabotage missions, crafting missions, harvesting missions, and exploration missions,\" said Bylos. \"And you choose one of those five mission types from the Landsraad board, and then you go to whichever map it points you to on the Overland.\" This folds into a new Landsraad specialization system included in the update, where players can earn XP in those differ…",

Even the title is a calligram: the umlauted O is our hero—the umlaut represents their ears—while the lowercase os are the bombs they carry around. In this puzzle metroidvania, the hero (let's just call them Ö from now on) can't really do much except explode those bombs. There is no jumping, no mantling, no attacking, no nothing, unless it can be achieved via the detonation of a bomb. When Ö starts with one bomb things seem simple enough: to jump, I spawn a bomb beneath myself and detonate. If I place a bomb and stand to the left of it before detonating, I'll be propelled leftward, which can be useful to clear a pit. Eventually Ö gets a second bomb, which offers a little more manoeuvrability while further complicating the puzzles. All this points to a clever but by no means revelatory puzzle game.

While that does make the i600 a less compact gaming PC than the first iteration, it is a far more effective device because of it. And it's still pretty small if you compare it to most RTX 5080-based gaming PCs on the market. You can, of course, build out a small form factor mini-ITX machine in something like the Fractal Design Terra and have yourself a powerful micro machine, but it's not going to be able to get close to matching the cooling and aural design of the Corsair One. This thing is pacey, and this thing does it all with an understated grace you'll struggle to match with any compact DIY build. The key to that is the dual 240 mm AIO water cooling loops the Corsair One employs to keep its CPU and GPU components chill.

Wikiflix is a free, online archive of about 4,000 public domain films (via TechCrunch and Annie Rauwerda of Depths of Wikipedia ). 1922's Nosferatu, 1927's Metropolis, and 1946's It's A Wonderful Life are all here, in addition to a wealth of other black and white pictures that deftly answers the question, 'what would Netflix have looked like 100 years ago?' It's incredible to see actors and action from a century ago—and I'm trying very hard not to get on my own 'why don't we take videogame preservation as seriously?' soap box right now. Wikiflix pulls its video from a variety of sources, including YouTube, Wikimedia Commons, and the Internet Archive but I think the best part is that it's not just collating early examples of English-language cinema.

I can't imagine playing Diablo 4 without sanctification, a new crafting system that is technically exclusive to the season but shouldn't be because it's almost perfect. It is responsible for dramatically improving the core loop of the game in ways I wasn't really expecting after playing with an unfinished version on the test server a few months ago. Sanctification is essentially a way to gamble with items for a chance at extraordinary outcomes. You take a piece of gear to a special forge and roll the dice to see what new bonuses are added to them. And those bonuses aren't always some extra strength or maximum life; they can add effects from the best items in the game. A forgettable pair of gloves can become the most powerful gloves you've ever worn, if you're lucky enough. This means every piece of loot is an opportunity for something amazing.
