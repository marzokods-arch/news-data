But Microsoft is now exhibiting 420BLAZEIT levels of AI hysteria by imagining that the logo for Copilot, a Windows 11 feature that nobody cares about or indeed likes, belongs on its 2025 ugly Christmas sweater. This year's sweater, dubbed \" Artifact ,\" follows the fuzzy XP hills , iconic Windows 3.0 logo, and successive sweaters featuring MS Paint, Minesweeper and Clippy. This year, Clippy returns as a prominent sweater feature, but he's joined by a hodgepodge of other Windows-related logos that frankly scream \"lazy clipart compilation.\" Which might actually be a perfect aesthetic for a nostalgic ugly Christmas sweater, what with the pixel art icons for MS-DOS, Paint, MSN and Internet Explorer. But then there's Copilot. Every other icon on the sweater dates back to the 1990s with the odd exception of the Minecraft Creeper, which already feels out of place. But what d…",

And the biggest crime of all: you can't play poker. For the past 15 years, our choices of casino games in New Vegas have been limited to slot machines, blackjack, and roulette. But finally, finally , one heroic modder has added video poker. And New Vegas, at last, feels more like Present Vegas as a result. The mod by W00Z, called wGames - Introducing Video Poker , adds a classic of the video poker genre: Jacks or Better. Belly up to the machine, place a bet, and you'll be dealt five cards. Click the ones you want to hold and you'll be given new cards to replace the discarded ones. If you've got a pair of jacks, you'll win your money back. Anything higher like two-pair, three of a kind, a flush, a straight, and so on, and you'll rake in the caps. With the mod installed these new video poker terminals can be found in The Tops, Gomorrah, the Atomic Wrangler, and all other New Vegas casinos, with a lovely detail that the card backs on each machine will vary depending on which joint you're gambling in.

It didn't launch in the best way, but after a year of patching I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. Then this year brought Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a ground-up but faithful remake of the beloved MGS3 that impressed almost everyone . It may not be the glorious future this series deserves, but it showed that Konami could still kick it at the top table, and produce a Metal Gear game that looks and feels like it belongs in 2025.

The two-minute reel includes finished scenes from the likes of GTA5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, alongside various one-off animations with Pixar-style cartoon characters, but it's the opening 20 seconds that's attracting all the attention. The three animations are flat-textured and set to Tom Petty's Love is a Long Road, the song featured in GTA 6's first trailer. The first shows a male character removing what seems to be the GTA 6 version of a Lime Bike from the rental rack, and then returning the bike to the same spot. Eagle-eyed fans had previously identified bike racks for some sort of rental company (which may well be called \"Lombike\"), so clearly this is another aspect of modern urban life that has found its way into the game. The other two animations show a character, which does resemble protagonist Lucia, clambering down from a truck bed first of all, before the second animation shows her hopping down from the truck roof to the truck bed, and then out to the ground. There are also a few buildings…",

      "body": "Another day, another round of bad news regarding the ongoing RAM shortage and rising PC hardware prices . TrendForce reports that the NAND flash wafer supply is getting worse, which will directly impact SSD prices, and it already has. How long will it take for those price changes to trickle down to the consumer market? And how long will it take for RAM prices to improve? Today's brought us a few interesting findings, so let's dig in. Starting with the NAND flash prices, TrendForce reports that the demand for NAND flash used in SSDs is strong. To the surprise of no one, that demand is largely fueled by large enterprises (thank you, AI), meaning that's where the manufacturers currently have their focus. The massive demand has led to a short supply, which then led to a price increase in November. The monthly average prices for wafers rose from 20% to 60%. Triple-level cell (TLC) memory was the most impacted. This type of NAND flash stores three bits of data per memory cell. Quad-level cell (QLC) NAND flash is also in high demand and short supply. (Image credit: Future) RAM is suffering from the same problems as SSDs, but on a larger scale. Even some of the best Cyber Monday deals are…",

Grivel said when he left Ubisoft in October 2022 that after 11 years at the company, \"it is now time for me to go on a new adventure.\" That adventure, according to his LinkedIn profile, took him immediately to Electronic Arts, where he spent a year and a half working on Battlefield 6 as studio design director at Ridgeline Games. That came to an end when Ridgeline closed in early 2024 as part of major cuts at EA , and so Grivel tripped back to Ubisoft to work briefly on \"an unannounced project in conception phase.\" He left again at the end of 2024 to join Worlds Untold—just in time for that studio to fall victim to major cuts at NetEase . And now he's back where it all began. \"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!\" Grivel wrote on LinkedIn (via GamesRadar ). \"A very special team and project to me.\" If you're hoping that Grivel follo…",

Indeed, the game's executive producer Michael Choung said the format had \" absolutely proven itself \" two weeks ago—sustaining interest in the game over a longer period than a one-and-done release likely would have. But Choung doesn't see the approach as some kind of magic bullet AdHoc—or any studio—can just apply to everything. \"It's insane to do,\" he told Edge's Knowledge newsletter . \"From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this.\" The game's lead producer, Natalie Herman, agreed with Choung: \"From a production perspective, we released four times. We were basically a live-service game for a month.\" The point Choung is making isn't that episodic releases ought to be avoided—that'd be an odd move from a developer whose game is on-track to beat its three-year \"bull case\" sales projections in three months—but rather that anyone looking on…",

But today's File Explorer tests prove that there's more to it than that—Microsoft simply still has some work to do to make Windows 11 as good as it can (or even should) be. Microsoft is currently testing preloading File Explorer in the latest Insider Preview Build 26220.7271, available on the Dev and Beta channels. Windows Latest took the new improvement out for a spin, and the results are underwhelming at best. Preloading (or pre-caching) is meant to speed up the load times of File Explorer, which have, so far, been a major downgrade compared to Windows 10. Microsoft is testing loading File Explorer into local memory before you ever need it, so it loads faster when you do. Testing shows that Microsoft has succeeded, but only on paper. (Image credit: Microsoft) Windows Latest ran a bunch of test on a virtual machine limited to 4 GB RAM. Without preloading, launching File Explorer accounted for 32.4 MB of RAM, and enabling the feature nearly doubled RAM usage, bringing it up to 67.4 MB. That's negligible usage, of course, even on …",

Oh, and that it's located in a church in San Francisco? News outfit CNN caught up with the Internet Archive, which incorporates the Wayback Machine, recently. Located on Funston Avenue in San Francisco in a large neoclassical building that used to be a Christian Scientist church, the Wayback Machine now maintains 29 years of web history. Back in 1996 at the inception of the archive, a whole year's worth of webpages added up to about 2 TB of storage. Now, a mere day soaks up 150 TB and a copy of the entire archive is 175 petabytes and counting upwards . In October, the Archive celebrated the successful storage of one trillion web pages. While a set of servers have been \"symbolically\" placed in the former church building, the whole archive isn't actually stored in the Funston Avenue locale. Most of the archive’s servers are in a warehouse outside San Francisco, with copies distributed throughout the world. Those backups aren't just prudent in the event of fire, flood or other physical catastrophe. CNN points out that the Trump administration has de…",

The CPU has just appeared on AMD's driver page (spotted by Olrak29 ) with zero fanfare and zero details. Love that for us—we get to speculate a bit. The truth is, we've already had some leaks about the 9850X3D in the last few months, so we have an idea of what to expect, but none of it has come directly from AMD. At least we now know the processor exists, so chances are that the specs are real, but you never know with these leaks. Previously, another Twitter leaker, ch11eddog , said that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D would come with a 120 W TDP, eight cores and 16 threads, 96 MB of L3 cache, and a boost clock speed of 5.6 GHz. That gives it a 400 MHz advantage over the 9800X3D.

Oh, and with that comes the warning that the new AI features are prone to \"hallucinate\" and \"introduce novel security risks.\" As to the details, Microsoft says security flaws include \"cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.\" In other words, you could download, say, a PDF which contains hidden text instructing your Windows agent to execute nefarious tasks. And it might just carry out those instructions. So, surely Microsoft has some mitigations in place? Up to a point. Firstly and mercifully, these new agentic features are not enabled by default.

This is especially the case with Baldur's Gate 3, where performers like Neil Newbon and Amelia Tyler have gone on to become evangelists for the game. Speaking with our friends over at GamesRadar during the Golden Joysticks, Karlach's VO, Samantha Béart, says they've noticed this discrepancy first hand: \"There's a weird disconnect between, maybe, developers' attitude towards where we fit in the ecosystem—where we're not actually part of the team—versus the players, who very much see us as the forefront.

So, it looks like we won't have to wait too long before REPO receives its next batch of content after all, and in my opinion, it's the most exciting one yet. In a YouTube video uploaded to the semiwork channel , developer Pontus shared that they \"acknowledge that a lot of people want new levels and meta progression, such things will be added to the game but it won't be the main focus of the next update.\" Instead, the next update will focus on adding cosmetics for your Semibot to the game, which is a feature a huge number of players have been requesting since its launch in early access. However, cosmetics usually mean microtransactions, but if alarm bells are ringing in your head you can rest assured that semiwork will not be adding any sort of in-game store (aside from the one you already visit in the game) where you can buy new cosmetics and customise your bot. Instead, Pontus was incredibly firm that microtransactions do not hav…",

Listen, that last one is good, but it's terrible for fighting games thanks to its ridiculously mushy d-pad. Nobody wants a mushy d-pad when they're trying to rapid-fire directional inputs. And as someone who loves getting a long nail manicure, they were causing me to misinput all over the gaff. I tried fight sticks previously but couldn't get with the whole, well, stick part of it. Then earlier this year, I finally made the switch to a leverless controller. One that trades out any sort of analog inputs for a flat, all-button setup. And you know what? It's been a game changer.

Besides, that is, the standard routine of a new realm opening up in the Dream Castle, and needing an extortionate amount of Dreamlight to get there in the first place. This lack of information is what makes preparation for an update like this so important.

Tactics RPGs about students who fight demonic analogues of small-town problems at night, yet have to balance that with school and social obligations by day? I'd say sign me up, but even the shorter ones take 80+ hours and the longer ones demand well over 100. I tried Metaphor: ReFantazio and gave up in boredom during the second dungeon. They are not games that respect your time. So Demonschool, which seems to basically be a Persona game in all but name and the fact it can be wrapped in under 40 hours, should have been an instant slam-dunk. Our reviewer, Mollie Taylor, liked it well enough , praising the intricacy of its battle system and the wit of its dialogue, but had an important reservation. At launch, it suffered from \"some wonkily-threaded narrative beats\" and \"some general visual bugs and systems that felt a little obtuse at times\". No problems that couldn't be patched it seems, which made me put it on the \"wait\" pile rather than the \"play immediately\" pile. With every update it shifts a little closer to that second pile, and the latest, which Demonschool developer Necrosoft is calling its second big post-release patch , seeming like a s…",

Blue & Blood is an ambitious total conversion mod that reimagines the game from the other side of the law—not as a young gangster clawing his way up, but as a cop teetering on the edge of corruption. The mod drops players into the boots of the LSPD’s most infamous unit, CRASH, in a story that blurs the line between justice and vice. The result is something gritty and unmistakably GTA, and it’s being built by two people: Cascavel, a veteran roleplayer and modder, and giacobbe, a software engineer with a lifelong love for the series. Roleplay roots For Cascavel, Blue & Blood was born out of San Andreas Multiplayer. He spent years on a text-based server called Los Santos Roleplay, crafting characters and stories with hundreds of others in real time. \"That experience made me appreciate strong writing and believable characters,\" he says. That storytelling instinct followed him into modding. Cascavel began with pedestrian models, launched a successful Blender tutorial series, and explored total conversions like Frost…",

Or singing the chorus while hitting the Narukami Shuffle to the best of my ability. I'm still working on that part, my shuffle game is weak.

Lehto, who is an alumnus of Ohio's Kent State University, was speaking to Kent State Magazine (via GamesRadar ) about the impact his education had on his future career. During that interview, he chatted about the process Bungie went through to design Master Chief's armour. \"The creation of the Master Chief is something that I went through so many wringers to try to find the right look, the right feel, the right stature for such a character,\" Lehto explained. \"We tried a lot of things.\" Some of these initial designs have made it to the Internet, such as Shi Kai Wang's early concept for Master Chief.

      "body": "Back in 2023, South Korean developer Wonder Potion released Sanabi , a sleek, cyberpunk-themed action platformer that saw players slinging themselves around levels with a giant grappling hook. Favourably compared to Katana Zero , it received near-universal praise for its crisp pixel art, Bionic Commando-esque platforming challenges, and surprisingly involved storyline. Two years on from Sanabi's launch, Wonder Potion has now released an expansion for Sanabi. Titled Sanabi: A Haunted Day , it’s a prequel spinoff in which you play as a different character from the main game. Also, it's completely free. Sanabi: A Haunted Day puts players in the role of Major Song, who has a minor role in the base game. As mentioned, the DLC takes place before the events of Sanabi, with Song investigating a sprawling robots scrapyard which the DLC's Steam page says is plagued by \"strange phenomena\". Alongside the new location, Song has a completely different moveset from the base game's protagonist. While she lacks a grappling hook, she is nonetheless capable of \"agile aerial manoeuvres\" such as an infinitely replenishable mid-air jump. She also wields a massive shotgun—which I always find endearing i…",

A highlight of those anthologies were the stories about Gotrek and Felix, a duo in the sword-and-sorcery tradition, with one a homicidal maniac and the other a simple poet doomed to follow the other around recording his adventures while trying not to get killed by them. They were a perfect encapsulation of Warhammer, grim but also a bit silly, heroic but also earthy. Eventually they'd get their own novels, but first they appeared in a compilation of short stories called Trollslayer. Honestly, I don't think the Felix and Gotrek stories worked as well once they were expanded out to novel length. With a few exceptions, almost all of their best adventures were short stories like those collected in Trollslayer, which is why I'm interested in the special edition Games Workshop recently announced . The hardcover book comes with a bookmark shaped like an axe, art prints including a map of the Old World and a wanted poster for the book's ostensible heroes, two coins—a gold crown from Felix's home of the Empire, and a silver dwa…",

He said as much in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel yesterday—the same channel where he routinely shares insights and commentary from his entire body of gamedev work, including everything from the original Fallout to Wildstar and The Outer Worlds. The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't. To summarize, his argument is thus: canon is \"whatever the owner of the IP says it is,\" an individual's interpretation is personal and freeform and therefore \"you can't be wrong,\" and authorial intent is another matter altogether that usually differs from team member to team member, and may even diverge greatly from canon.

Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . Like roughly half of the internet, I am fascinated by Kowloon Walled City . Built on the site of a military fort, the Walled City was a Chinese enclave situated within former British Hong Kong. Its existence was tolerated by Britain provided China made no effort to exercise its jurisdiction. This peculiar legal status left it largely ignored by both nations, and as such it became the site of rapid, unplanned urban development through the latter half of the 20 th Century. At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth. More than 35,000 people lived in an area of six and a half acres, giving it a density ten times that of Earth's most tightly packed cities like Giza and Manila.

The vast majority of people who play this Geometry Wars -inspired roguelike love it too, as its 97% positive Steam rating attests. But Steam's rapidly revolving release tombola means that making a great game is no guarantee of commercial success. And as Sektori's developer recently explained, the kaleidoscopic schmup is still a long way from making him any money. Reacting to Sektori's launch on Bluesky, former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen said reception to the twin-stick shooter had been \"awesome\" and \"much more than I expected for such a niche thing\". Lahtinen fully appreciates the highly specific appeal of Geometry Wars-style games, likely why Housemarque itself pivoted to making third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros. Now though, Lahtinen says the response to Sektori has given him hope. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. I went into this fully knowing I would never recoup. It would be my calling card, but nothing people would have ever heard of,\" he says. \"But 100+ Steam reviews, 97% positive + ~90 Metacritic is unexpected to say the least.\" Following this, …",

MindsEye was thoroughly unpleasant to play, panned by players and critics alike (including myself , to be fully transparent). The fallout from its failure was even less savoury, with Build A Rocket Boy's boss Leslie Benzies reportedly blaming the game's failure on 'saboteurs', before the studio laid off more than a hundred employees. Some of those axed designers then accused Build A Rocket Boy of mismanagement and a total lack of direction, claiming that Benzies \"never decided what game he wanted to make\".
