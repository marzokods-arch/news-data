The Swedish automaker says that owners of model year 2025 EX90s— like the one we tested earlier this summer —are eligible for an upgrade to the electric vehicle's core computer. Specifically, the cars will get a new dual Nvidia DRIVE AGX Orin setup, which Volvo says will improve performance and reduce battery drainage, as well as enabling some features that have been TBD so far. That will presumably be welcome news—the EX90 is a shining example of how the \"minimal viable product\" idea has infiltrated the auto industry from the tech sphere. That's because Volvo has had a heck of time with the EX90 development, having to delay the EV not once but twice in order to get a handle on the car's software. Read full article Comments",

A criminal complaint unsealed on Thursday (PDF) said that Thalha Jubair, 19, of London, was part of Scattered Spider, the name of an English-language-speaking group that has breached the networks of scores of companies worldwide. After obtaining data, the group demanded that the victims pay hefty ransoms or see their confidential data published or sold. Bitcoin paid by victims recovered The unsealing of the document, filed in US District Court of the District of New Jersey, came the same day Jubair and another alleged Scattered Spider member—Owen Flowers, 18, from Walsall, West Midlands—were charged by UK prosecutors in connection with last year’s cyberattack on Transport for London . The agency, which oversees London’s public transit system, faced a monthslong recovery effort as a result of the breach. Read full article Comments",

These and other unusual research questions were honored tonight in a virtual ceremony to announce the 2025 recipients of the annual Ig Nobel Prizes. Yes, it's that time of year again, when the serious and the silly converge—for science. Established in 1991, the Ig Nobels are a good-natured parody of the Nobel Prizes; they honor \"achievements that first make people laugh and then make them think.\" The unapologetically campy awards ceremony features miniature operas, scientific demos, and the 24/7 lectures whereby experts must explain their work twice: once in 24 seconds and the second in just seven words. Acceptance speeches are limited to 60 seconds. And as the motto implies, the research being honored might seem ridiculous at first glance, but that doesn't mean it's devoid of scientific merit. In the weeks following the ceremony, the winners will also give free public talks, which will be posted on the Improbable Research website. Read full article Comments",

For people who use AI tools, some of these additions might actually be helpful, and for everyone else, well, Firefox still exists. The most prominent change, and one that AI subscribers may have already seen, is the addition of a Gemini button on the desktop browser. This button opens a popup where you can ask questions about—and get summaries of—content in your open tabs. Android phones already have Gemini operating at the system level to accomplish similar tasks, but Google says the iOS Gemini app will soon be built into Chrome for Apple devices.

That doesn't sit well with some lawmakers , but the Republican-controlled Congress committed $25 billion in July as a down payment for new missile-defense technologies. The White House stated in May that Golden Dome will cost $175 billion over three years, but a new study from a center-right think tank concludes that it is simply not enough to develop the kind of multi-layer shield Trump described in a January executive order. It's also clear that it will take longer than three years to implement the full spectrum of defense capability envisioned for Golden Dome. Read full article Comments",

      "body": "Certain dogs can not only memorize the names of objects like their favorite toys, but they can also extend those labels to entirely new objects with a similar function, regardless of whether or not they are similar in appearance, according to a new paper published in the journal Current Biology. It's a cognitively advanced ability known as \"label extension,\" and for animals to acquire it usually involves years of intensive training in captivity. But the dogs in this new study developed the ability to classify their toys by function with no formal training, merely by playing naturally with their owners. Co-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, likens this ability to a person calling a hammer and a rock by the same name, or a child understanding that \"cup\" can describe a mug, a glass, or a tumbler, because they serve the same function. “The rock and the hammer look physically different, but they can be used for the same function,\" she said. \"So now it turns out that these dogs can do the same.” Fugazza and her Hungarian colleagues have been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years. For instance, in 2023, we reported on the group's e…",

To be sure, Meta's first commercial smartglasses with a built-in display are a far cry from the Orion prototype Zuckerberg showed off last year. The actual \"display\" part of the Ray-Ban Display is a paltry 600×600 resolution square that updates at just 30 Hz and takes up a tiny 20-degree portion of only the right eyepiece. Compared to the 70-degree field-of-view and head-tracked stereoscopic 3D \"hologram\" effect shown on the Orion lenses, that's a little disappointing. Still, Zuckerberg was able to call the 42 pixels per degree (PPD) you get on the Ray-Ban Display's display \"very high resolution,\" in a sense (the Meta Quest 3 tops out at around 25 PPD across its much larger display).

Lost in the focus on Microsoft was something as, or more, urgent: never-before-revealed details that now invite scrutiny of Ascension’s own security failings. In a letter sent last week to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said an investigation by his office determined that the hack began in February 2024 with the infection of a contractor's laptop after they downloaded malware from a link returned by Microsoft’s Bing search engine. The attackers then pivoted from the contractor device to Ascension’s most valuable network asset: the Windows Active Directory, a tool administrators use to create and delete user accounts and manage system privileges to them. Obtaining control of the Active Directory is tantamount to obtaining a master key that will open any door in a restricted building. Wyden blasted Microsoft for its…",

According to a letter sent by Nissan to its dealers, obtained by the trade publication, \"This decision enables the company to reallocate resources and optimize its EV portfolio as the automotive landscape continues to evolve.\" Whether the Ariya returns for MY27 is unclear and probably depends both on the state of the US EV market by then as well as Nissan's own finances. The blame? The 15 percent import tariff levied by President Trump, which is one straw too many for the financially beleaguered automaker, as the Ariya is built in Japan at Nissan's Tochigi plant and must be shipped across the ocean to fulfill US orders.
