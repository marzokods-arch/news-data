A funny thing happened this week, though: During a big Cloudflare outage on Tuesday, Downdetector itself went down. What do you do then? Gus Owen, creator of web game TimeGuessr (it's like GeoGuessr, but you're guessing both the location and year a photo was taken), had an idea: Make a Downdetector for Downdetector. Downdetector's Downdetector , as Owen called it, tells you whether or not Downdetector is down. Its functionality has been called into question , but the satirical website was nevertheless a hit on Y Combinator's Hacker News forum , leading to some good old fashioned internet goofing off. Someone quickly followed up Downdetector's Downdetector with Downdetector's Downdetector's Downdetector (downdetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetector.com), which tells you whether or not Downdetector's Downdetector is down. That of course prompted someone else to post a link to Downdetector's Downdetector's Downdetector's Downdetector (downdetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetector.com), which…",

If I were to show you a tiny sliver of a screenshot from a game like Counter-Strike or Minecraft or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you could probably identify it easily, even without context. The art style and scenery and even the color palate of the games we play eventually get burned into our brains. But how about if I snipped a letter out of a game's stylized title? Think you could identify them, too? If I showed you just an X or a B or a Q, could you tell me what game title it was from? That's today's quiz, and we're going through the entire alphabet, A-Z. I'll show you 26 letters I painstaking cut out of game logos, and you type in the game name. (Feel free to use hints if you get stuck.) Remember, not every letter I show you is the first letter of the game name! And B sure to let us know how U scored in the comments, K?",

Most players run into a quest early on where you need to heal a goose, but failing it causes the goose to transform into a demon known as Maniacal Goose. Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into. But there's an achievement involved for killing it and we all know that's gamer kryptonite. As players of the new game wrestled with the demon goose and the other geese you can find hanging out in the open world, a strategy formed: throw them into the water and let nature take care of it.

The fact that it cost $15 didn't help, and most players at the time were mourning Hopoo's exit and what they saw as a naked attempt to cash in. Things are going a bit better this time. While also costing $15—nearly two-thirds the price of the base game— Alloyed Collective adds a whole lot to the game, including two new characters, seven stages with new music tracks, and a new final boss. More importantly, it doesn't seem to be breaking fundamental game systems like physics and how damage is calculated. The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, at least among folks who've bought the DLC. The Risk of Rain 2 Steam forums have not been so generous, with reactions like \"Gearbox slop\" and complaints that the DLC isn't free all over the place.

Hughes and Speckert don't have any screenplays about being chained together a la Chained Together on their resumes yet, but they have worked on another videogame adaptation: the upcoming Finding Frankie film, the source material for which looks to be one of those not-quite-Five Nights at Freddy's-type games littered about Steam. It's an odd choice for an adaptation. Chained Together doesn't strike me as a narratively inclined game, but then again, neither do Minecraft , Outrun , or Rampage .

The feature is now live, though voluntary, with the requirement for either \"Facial Age Estimation\" or ID verification becoming mandatory worldwide from December 2025 to January 2026. Users who do not wish to use chat features do not have to complete an age check. \"Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become Trusted Connections with people they know,\" says the Roblox announcement .

Keighley, host of The Game Awards, posted a message on X urging his followers to \"Check out #TheGameAwards nominee page on Steam to celebrate the best of the year.\" He attached an image of the Steam front page, which—because he was logged in at the time—revealed that he has precisely one game in his wishlist.

Liz Albl joined CD Projekt last month in the role of senior writer on Cyberpunk 2 . Prior to this, she spent almost three years as narrative lead at Cloud Chamber Games working on BioShock 4, with her other credits including Ghost of Tsushima , Watch Dogs: Legion , and just over a year working on Monolith's cancelled Wonder Woman game . As spotted by IGN , Albl left Cloud Chamber in August—around the time the developer laid off staff after BioShock 4 failed an internal review , with its narrative criticised by 2K's executives in particular as the publisher committed to a development overhaul. BioShock 4 had already been in development for a decade before the review, with 2K announcing it was in production six years ago.

Simply put, I like the way the Stitcher, Ferro, and Anvil feel compared to competition like the Kettle, Arpeggio, and Torrente, among others. And that's lucky for me now that I've seen the maths behind it all. Content creator ' Min Max Lab ', who's been doing a bunch of excellent Arc Raiders science experiments lately, has worked out the efficiency of the most common and popular weapons by weighing up their max durability, how much is lost per shot, and how expensive each one is to repair. As cliché as it sounds, the results will surprise you. Firstly, my beloved Stitcher is the most efficient of the bunch, wringing out 13,700 damage/1950 shots per full repair at level 4, which works out to just two credits per shot.

For context, it's worth noting that comparing nodes between companies is awfully tricky. Superficially, you might expect Samsung's new 2 nm node, also known as SF2, to be broadly comparable to TSMC's upcoming N2 technology, which has yet to be seen in a chip you can actually buy but is also ostensibly a 2 nm-class node. On paper, you'd also throw Intel's 18A node into the same category. Again, Intel's 18A isn't out yet but is due any day now. In practice, it's way more complicated than that. For instance, the very notion of the implied scale of \"2 nm\" is now quite disconnected from actual feature size inside modern chips.

That puts it halfway to matching its predecessor's lifetime sales, including the sales of its well-received expanded edition, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side.

Broadly speaking, it's an effort to catch up with Nvidia's equivalent DLSS technologies, which have been ahead of AMD's curve when it comes to the use of machine learning in general, along with some specific capabilities that AMD lacks. The headline enhancement is more fully leveraging machine learning for upscaling, which is why, as we understand it and as the new AMD teaser trailer implies, Redstone will be tied to AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT . Only the latest AMD graphics architecture has sufficient hardware matrix math ability to run the AI code. Or so the story likely goes, anyway. Slightly confusingly, AMD has also said that Redstone can run on Nvidia GPUs on account of being developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code).

Since you won't be extracting items, I'd recommend bringing a free loadout . Hell, you could even just surrender if the map gives you a bad spawn point necessitating a giant trek across the map, if you're eager to get this quest done speedily.

With that 20th anniversary in mind, developer ArenaNet has announced the most substantial overhaul in the game's history: December 3 will see the launch of Guild Wars Reforged , a visual and gameplay overhaul for the venerable monster-bothering quest-em-up. Reforged is co-developed by ArenaNet and new studio 2weeks, which is largely composed of former ArenaNet staff, and bills itself as a modernised version of the game and its (many) expansions. The visuals have had an HD overhaul, performance has been tweaked, the UI has been reworked, there's a new (optional) objective guide, and Reforged also boasts proper controller support and Steam Deck optimisation.

While US president Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping late last month resulted in a pause on some of its rare earth restrictions, earlier global controls outlined in April of this year are still in place. These restrictions require companies to obtain licenses from Beijing before exporting rare earth materials out of the country, and the approvals granted to date are said to be for small shipments only .

For the uninitiated, transmog (sometimes called glamour in other MMOs) is a system that allows players to slap a new appearance over their current gear. In WoW, you used to go to a transmog NPC, create an outfit, and pay a gold fee to throw on your fit. This would essentially overwrite the appearances of those items with the ones you transmogged them to. In Midnight, that's all changing. You can see a handy summary by WoWHead here , but in essence, WoW's moving from this overwritten appearance system to an \"outfit\" system. And, while I'm about to do a whole bunch of grumbling, there are some major benefits to what Blizzard's put together.
