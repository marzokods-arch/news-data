Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element. But as we've gone on, I'm growing less and less convinced that this idea—that we simply cannot handle anything more difficult, or it'll hurt our walnut gamer brains—was ever true. At the very least, it's not true right now.

Thankfully, it's an outskirt location, so you don't have to worry about venturing into town to contend with patrolling Arcs or loot-hungry players. All that said, here's how to complete Marked for Death in Arc Raiders. Reach Su Durante Warehouses in the Outskirts in Buried City The Su Durante Warhouses are in the north of Buried City (Image credit: Embark Studios) Your first step in the Marked for Death quest is making your way to the Su Durante Warehouses in the north of the Buried City. This is a fairly easy location to get to, depending on your spawn, but since it's on the outskirts rather than in the centre, you can expect far fewer players and Arcs.

For another, the buyout came from a group of investors that included Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners—founded by Donald Trump's son in law Jared Kushner. LGBT people and women more generally face repression in Saudi Arabia , while Kushner, of course, has strong ties to a Trump administration which has made attacking LGBT rights a cornerstone of its platform. The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements. That'd be a terrible idea for a lot of obvious, moral reasons, but one OG Sims designer (via FRVR ) says it would be \"existential for the business.\" Charles London, who worked as art director on The Sims 1 and creative director on The Sims 2, said that representing same-sex relationships in the earlier games was \"everything\" for the series. \"I think it's existential for the business, right?

Where to find Rusted Tools in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Unsurprisingly, you have a higher chance of finding Rusted Tools in Mechanical and Industrial areas, such as in red tool boxes, crates, and other containers. The best locations are around the cars in Scrap Yard, and in the lower floors of Water Treatment Control, and Primary Facility on Dam Battlegrounds , as it's easy to loot all three areas in a single run, and there are multiple extraction points nearby.

Asus has just announced the ROG GR70 mini PC, which stands upright and sort of looks like a small PS5.

Asus isn't dropping the NUC branding entirely, however, as the Intel-powered 2025 version of the ROG NUC , using the exact same chassis design, has been around since the summer.

No, I personally don't care much for any of that AI nonsense. In Preview Build 26220.7051 , the real headliner for me is Shared Audio, a new feature that allows for two folks to watch the same movie or listen to the same playlist via two separate Bluetooth devices. It's the little things. For Windows Insiders, it works much like connecting your Copilot+ PC to any singular Bluetooth audio device. Just navigate over to the 'shared audio (preview)' tile in the quick settings menu, select two compatible, already paired audio devices, and then hit 'share'. Now, there truly is no escape from my Miku Hatsune playlist. Well, that is unless my put-upon pals can avoid placing themselves within about 30 paces of a compatible device. There's a more in-depth Windows blog post about extending Bluetooth Low Energy Audio on Windows 11 and its role in this new shared audio feature, but the bottom line is that it's only supported on \"select Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs\" right no…",

It was somewhat grounded in reality but also a bit zany too. It had a lot more satirical elements vs the later entries.\" He also, offhandedly, refers to his pitch as \"Saints Row '77\" which might tell you…",

Most of REPO's existing critters are unsettling, especially the Upscream and the Animal, but there's nothing that really petrifies you. The same can't be said for the game now though, and having spent the weekend running for my life and screaming over proximity chat, REPO really lives up to its horror tag. The 10 new monsters launched as part of this update span all three \"levels\". So, you've got the less-intimidating level one beasts like the new Tick, which resembles a chunky beige bug with big black eyes, or Elsa the dog who is fairly harmless until she takes damage. But then REPO massively ramps up the fear factor by throwing in something horrifying like the Birthday Boy, a character which roams the level placing balloons—which again, seems harmless. But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell. It's a real mixed bag, and with the existing roster of monsters it's quite refreshing to see some new characters pop up rather than cycling through the same bunch.

Yep, Schedule 1's Halloween update missed the ghost train by two whole days.

As it's in a staged rollout, you may not see it when you boot your device up, but it should hopefully arrive over the next few weeks or so.

The Windows anti-infringement system still works , helpfully declaring that this copy of the OS is not in fact genuine. If you want to noodle around with the outrageously small OS yourself, @XenoPanther has uploaded the file list to Archive.org . It's only the latest in a long line of unofficial attempts to shrink Windows. Last year, we saw another software tinkerer shrink Windows 11 down to only 100 MB by making it throwback to its DOS era.

But it seems this wasn't enough to right Heart Machine's ailing vessel, as the studio began a second round of layoffs late last week. This time the cuts were focussed on the team creating the side-scrolling action/adventure Possessor(s), occurring less than a fortnight before the game is due to launch. The combined layoffs have led some players to question whether to continue supporting Heart Machine financially. In a Steam discussion , user Adam posted that it's \"hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game.\" This was apparently posted in response to the initial round of layoffs, but other users began to debate whether developers who'd had their jobs working on Possessor(s) cut would see a return for their efforts. \"I have no intention of giving money to a company that thanked them for that work by kickin…",

It also just happens to be a really solid tactics game on top of all that, which is nice, and is why we gave it our Best Tactics award last year . I'm also not alone—if we go by Steam reviews, almost everyone who plays this thing agrees. It's got a sterling 98% \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" score for English reviews . Basically, if you like tactics games, you're probably gonna like this thing. My only complaint at the time was that its postgame felt a smidge undercooked. Tactical Breach Wizards' agents all have really interesting, and powerful, suites of abilities—and by the time you get to its final missions, you're cleanly sweeping through its challenges without much trouble. Which isn't a deal-breaker, mind. As I put it: \"If the worst I can say is that I simply want more of Tactical Breach Wizards, that's a sign we've got something special on our hands.\" And hey!

Luckily, a new biome is rolling out this week on November 5, which will be an alternative for the Tropics, though I'm not particularly thrilled about what might be lurking there either. In a trailer posted to the Aggro Crab and Landfall YouTube Channels, the Roots biome has been revealed. Though saying that, we aren't given a particularly in-depth look at what exactly that means in terms of climbing. Given that the two Scouts in the trailer are seen amongst a cluster of redwood trees, we can only assume that this biome will involve a lot of swinging between vines to reach the safety of platforms and Shelf Shrooms tucked between branches. However, one element that the trailer does hint towards is the addition of spiders. If they act in-game exactly as they do in the trailer, then these horrible critters will spring down from the top of trees and pick up Scouts.

What players didn't like was a bug specific to the PC version that made the sun blindingly bright on daylight tracks. \"HOW TO REMOVE THE SUN? LOL\" asks one poster on the Steam forum, while another laments, \"I guess the developers never heard of windshield visors or sunglasses.\" Wait long enough, and eventually a hero will come along—in this case a modder by the name of Radzerg, who just released a patch with the simple declaration, \"I've fixed the sun\".

It wasn't that you were crouched in the middle of nowhere with absolutely zero cover. Definitely not. If you play enough competitive shooters, you'll learn pretty quickly about the tricks graphics settings can play on you. Arc Raiders is the newest shooter with a foliage problem and you might not realize it's holding you back—especially if you're a sweaty PvPer. Knee-high bushes and other shrubbery can be toggled on or off through the foliage graphics setting, and you probably want it on \"low\". YouTuber staycation provides a good example of the difference with some bushes around a car. With the \"epic\" setting, the bushes obscure some of the ground around the edges of the car, which could make it hard to see someone at a distance. The lowest setting gets rid of them entirely, giving you a clean view to line up a shot or catch someone hiding. Notably, the foliage setting doesn't seem to affect the bi…",

For me, most of my exposure to boss themes growing up came through the endless stream of JRPGs I played. Final Fantasy 7's One Winged Angel will be the one that springs to mind for a lot of people, but I'm an absolute sucker for Final Fantasy 6's Dancing Mad—a whopping 18-minute, four-movement symphony that plays when facing off against Kefka Palazzo.

Alright, let me roll up my sleeves and deliver unto you some lore . Not just any lore: mod lore . Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently. World of Warcraft has historically embraced AddOn creators with open arms, giving a ton of the game's information to them in-client through its API. Crack open the shell of any WoW raider's client and you'll find a homebrew moonshine concoction of custom raid frames, sound effects, and WeakAuras telling them what buttons to push and when.

The cooperative shooter proved a disappointment when it released in June, launching in an anaemic state, lacking basic features like in-game voice chat and a tutorial, and generally seeming like a compromised vision despite a few novel ideas. Its first major update, Breakpoint, went some way to addressing these issues , but failed to provide the bump in players Remedy hoped for. Indeed, at the time of writing, just 25 people were playing FBC: Firebreak according to SteamDB . The actual count is likely higher given Firebreak's availability on consoles and Game Pass, but probably not by much. In early October, Remedy issued a profit warning for 2025 due to Firebreak's underperformance. Less than two weeks later, Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, stepped down with immediate effect. Now, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz , Remedy has issued its financial results for Q3 2025, posting a 32% decline in revenue versus Q3 2024, and an operating loss of €16.4 million. Unsurprisingly, Firebreak is the chief culprit, with Remedy recognising a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million due to the shooter's poor performance. Speaking in the report, …",

Vampires to their coffins, zombies to their graves, and humans as far away from here as they can get. The trick is that your tracks can't pass over each other, there's only room for one passenger per car, and there are fixed entrances and exits to each tiny area. The land of \"Trainsylvania\" has over 200 levels for you to figure out, with exactly the kind of thoughtful design you'd expect from Draknek. Which is to say that each area starts off fairly simple, with levels introducing new concepts and ways to use puzzle elements before delivering excellent brain-burning problems to solve with just the same materials you'd found so easily a few levels before.

Which makes sense, given how much the studio has added to it over the course of the Witcher games, like building Witcher schools based on an off-hand reference he threw in before regretting it . The other thing Sapkowski had to say about his relationship with CDPR is that, \"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now. Let's hope it stays that way.\" That was in reference to the lawsuit CDPR settled with Sapkowski in 2019 over royalties, with the author asserting that he'd handed over the rights for a pittance compared to the amount they ended up being worth.

Responding to an article by IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine about the videogame Love and Deepspace's failure to account for nonwhite characters when lighting scenes, Zelle highlighted how Volition handled that challenge in Saints Row: The Third, Skinballs. Skinballs was made up of four spheres, each textured in a different flesh tone and used by artists to ensure scenes were properly lit for characters of all potential skin colors. Borman, the director of digital preservation at the Strong, expressed his own appreciation for Skinballs , and noted that it's become a bit of a memetic delight in various mod communities, sort of like that purple checkerboard missing texture pattern you see in Source engine games.

There are also a couple exciting strategy games to consider this month—Europa Universalis 5 and Anno 117: Pax Romana—as well as RPGs worth paying attention to, including the long-awaited Demonschool, which jumped out of the way of Silksong to end up here, and narrative RPG Rue Valley, which might catch the eye of Disco Elysium fans. Further down on this list, you'll find a hearty selection of new early access games, as well as some games that are leaving early access. If you've been watching extraction shooter Escape from Tarkov from the sidelines, this might be the month to finally try it out, as it's hitting 1.0 and launching on Steam.

What's more, you can get hands-on with some of those new features right now. In a Steam post , Mechanistry explained that the 1.0 update will be \"different from anything we've done before.\" Rather than targeting a specific area of the experience, the 1.0 version \"expands the game across the board\" and brings \"many other little things that both you and we wanted to see in the game.\" This begins with a wide array of new map objects that you'll discover as you expand your beavers' metropolis. These include several natural phenomena like aquifers and geothermal fields, which you can exploit with discoverable tech like geothermal engines and aquifer drills. Other objects being introduced are more hazardous, like brambles that can harm your beavers when they try to clear them, and unstable cores that might explode should your beavers approach too closely. Elsewhere, the update will add two more maps to play on, each bringing distinct challenges. 'Pressure' situates al…",

As of now, that number has increased to 250. The latest batch of entries includes some big names like Splinter Cell , Resident Evil: HD Remaster (which has been preserved in digital amber a year after GOG convinced Capcom's bewildered execs to add the original version ) and Hitman: Codename 47, as well as forgotten gems like Clive Barker's Undying .

But Rockstar's original schoolyard simulator is about to receive a new lease of life. Thanks to a team of modders, Bully is getting an online mode, the enthusiast equivalent of what GTA Online is to GTA 5 . If you think that comparison is overblown, well, it probably is, given the years and countless dollars Rockstar has pumped into its multiplayer version of Los Santos. Nonetheless, Bully Online is still far more involved than I expected. Not only does the mod open up the town of Bullworth for persistent multiplayer shenanigans, but it also adds numerous supplementary systems to Rockstar's virtual playground. These include a roleplaying system, player-based inventory, and a trading system that lets you earn money and spend it on houses, weapons, vehicles etc. The mod also introduces several minigames to Bully, some of which are pretty …",

You'll certainly have less of it by the time you're done reading this review, and less still if you decide to pick up Hyperbeat: a rhythm game that roped me in with its oddball UI, low-poly dreamscapes, and atmospheric central hub full of NPCs eager to introspect with you. It is a small, severe world that quickly charmed me. While all rhythm games are about timing, time writ large, which you have a little less of by now, is Hyperbeat's foremost obsession. One hub NPC is a musician who longs for their bygone depression, if only because it was a source of inspiration in the days before their \"flop era.\" Another is a churlish artist whose precious moments are wasted fretting over the feedback of an audience (or talking to you, for that matter).
