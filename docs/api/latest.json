But just as all life ends in death, all digital gaming commerce ends in a cut for GabeN. Last Friday, New Blood CEO Dave Oshry said on X that Blood West's free giveaway on the Epic Games Store was a boon for the game… on Steam, where it sold \"like 200% more\" that day. He was quote-reposting a meme with over 40,000 likes expressing the sentiment that a cheap game on Steam is preferable to a free game on EGS. In the thread, he elaborated: \"I used to think EGS was a Marketing Black Hole but turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!\" He added that console sales spiked, as well. Is the Epic Games launcher really that bad? It's already got a huge install base since you need it to play one of the most popular games on Earth , and ev…",

If you're a PC gamer, your cup runneth over so much that you may still be catching up on the year's biggest hits even now, and you're not alone. In fact, one industry analysis group reckons Dec. 2025 was Steam's highest-grossing December ever. That estimation comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics , which reported that last month saw over 100 million Steam users generate $1.6 billion dollars in gross revenue. That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history. The report explains \"that’s up 22.7% over December 2024 and even more than December 2020’s pandemic-driven high of $1.4 billion.\" The report also notes that Arc Raiders is the second-biggest breadwinner of the season⁠—the first is eternally Counter-Strike 2, as dictated by the laws of physics—with a staggering 1.2 million copies sold just in the weeks between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4. As the article puts it, \"the brakes are broken on the ARC Raiders train,\" with the game selling 12 million copies overall. 250,000 copies were apparently sold on Boxing Day alone, with almost 3.2 million players checking in and half of them…",

For dark fantasy RPG Lunacid , however, developer Kira LLC took inspiration from the Japanese studio's far lesser-known series King's Field, which first appeared on the PlayStation 1. Despite taking this leftfield approach, Lunacid proved a big hit, racking up a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam from over 7,000 Steam reviews . Indeed, Lunacid has been successful enough that it's getting some DLC, even though its creator, Kira, is confused about the game's success. In a Steam post , Kira issued an update on the expansion's progress: \"I am still working on the DLC, it's about 70% done (I feel like it's been at 70% forever though). I definitely had too big a scope for it, but I have to complete it, even just for my sake.\" Kira points out that completing the DLC is currently her main project, briefly apologising for \"getting distracted by Halo modding.\" She doesn't provide an estimate for how long that additional 30% will take, but notes that the DLC's launch will coincide with \"a few more rounds of bug fixing that wil…",

Developer Re-Logic has set the date for January 27, less than two weeks away. Re-Logic announced the release date earlier this week via a Steam post . \"We have a few more things to get done between now and then,\" the studio wrote on Wednesday. \"But start the countdown because Terraria 1.4.5 will be in your hands in 13 short days!\" While a specific release date has proved elusive up to this point, update 1.4.5 has been nearly finished for some time. Back in August, Re-Logic revealed that it was \"in the endgame\" of development for the update, having defined an internal launch window that it confirmed with various partners. Re-Logic wanted update 1.4.5 to be a global launch concurrent across all platforms, which is partly what has held things up. Indeed, Re-Logic had hoped to release update 1.4.5 in December last year. But in another Steam post published on Boxing Day, it said that this \"wound up being impossible\" as it was \"not possible to get every platform and global partner together in time\".

That'll be rectified in a set of four \"Secret Lair\" drops later this month that return to the world of Fallout, one of them highlighting the stars of the TV show. That particular drop will include cards based on The Ghoul, Maximus, and Lucy, who gets her own card as well as appearing on Spirit Mantle (emerging from the Super Duper Mart in her armored vault suit), and Pre-War Formalwear (in the chaos of the cornfield on her wedding night). Max technically gets a second appearance as well, since that's him inside the T-60 Power Armor, which gets its own card as well. But it's not all TV tie-ins. There's also a batch of five New Vegas-themed cards, with Benny, Joshua Graham, The Platinum Chip, a Custom Caravan Deck, and a Sunset Sarsaparilla Machine all included.

Impressively, it's the first mod by TheCrowKnight, who says it contains \"A host of terrifying new enemies,\" as well as \"Three boss battles\" and \"over 350 professionally voice acted lines.\" Most of those voice lines presumably belong to the villainous lich Malkifer and a bard named Adabelle you'll be tasked with rescuing, though the credits also include \"The Undead Blacksmith\". The Rot Below also includes new magical items, including glowy enchanted swords, and conjuration spells that let you summon new undead servants. Maybe even some of the mushroom-headed skeletons who appear in the trailer. There's new music too, so if like me you muted Skyrim's repetitive score a hundred hours ago, maybe turn the volume back up for this one. You can download The Rot Below from Nexus Mods. …",

PC Gamer senior editor Christopher Livingston said in his impressions that the game \"has a long road ahead\" but \"what's here and working works well.\" The Hytale Team seems keen to keep the momentum up, as just four days after release, players have already been treated to a sizable update . It kicks off with a patch note containing the two most beautiful words in the English language: \"added dinosaurs.\" It's a good sign that the team has its priorities straight. But that's not all. There are some new character creation options, a slew of bug fixes including several crash fixes, and some balance changes addressing some fundamental-sounding problems: \"weapon attacks should now check for line of sight,\" for example. Some placeholder assets and animations have been traded for more polished ones, and \"cautious wildlife predators\" have been adjusted so that they don't attack you unless you give them a reason to.

No one was hurt, fortunately, but the trio of robbers brandished handguns and smashed open several display cases full of merchandise at the Poké Court on 13th Street. They stole what store owner Courtney Chin estimates is $100,000 in merchandise. The thieves remain at large. Now, I know what you're thinking. This crime, though unfortunate, is sort of novel and maybe even a little funny because a Pokémon store was robbed and not a bank or an art museum. That's why you're reading it on PC Gamer, after all. Typically, the only heists we cover involve Payday 3 or the latest crypto nonsense ⁠—who the heck steals Pokémon merch at gunpoint?

The co-op announcement comes with a lavish trailer showing the feature off, and states it will launch Jan. 22. I haven't tried the game myself yet in solo play or otherwise, but seeing a gaggle of heroes take on a huge boss together certainly makes it pop. The game's model for co-op, which was detailed in a lengthy explainer video from Moon Studios in Dec. 2025, is \"similar to how realms work in Minecraft, the only difference being you don't have to pay for a subscription.\" What that means is that rather than Dark Souls invasions, Diablo 4's quasi-MMO open world, or other ARPGs' multiplayer systems where a single player's save file is used, No Rest for the Wicked will distinguish between persistent multiplayer saves and offline single-player saves.

      "body": "I'll be honest, I didn't really think the live action Legend of Zelda movie would ever release when it was first announced in 2023. I become more convinced I was wrong with each passing day, as not only have they started casting folks for the rumored trilogy , but streaming giant Netflix has successfully negotiated for the movie's streaming rights. That was announced in a press release Thursday and reflects a continued partnership between Netflix and Sony Pictures Entertainment, the latter of which will distribute the film. It's part of a \"landmark global Pay-1 licensing deal\"—the Pay-1 window being the bit of a movie's rollout right after its theatrical run and home video release—which the release calls an \"industry first.\" The deal includes streaming rights to a host of Sony Pictures films, set to \"roll out gradually starting later this year as individual territory rights become available, with full global availability on Netflix in early 2029,\" the release states. That includes a bunch of films from Sony's back catalog (exactly what is not clear yet), and upcoming flicks like The Legend of Zelda and Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. OK, I admit it: I played a ton of XCOM 2 again over the holiday break and now I can't stop thinking about it. In my defence, it's certainly a game that still feels as relevant now as it ever did. People still speculate on a possible XCOM 3 daily online, and the flood of imitators has only gotten bigger the longer the series has remained dormant. Personally I think I'll be waiting with baited breath all year to find out when I can get my hands on cheekily named spiritual successor Star Wars Zero Company . So an XCOM quiz doesn't feel too self-indulgent or out of nowhere… right? I knew it had to be more than just a smattering of trivia, however. PC Gamer's readers are some of the most diehard XCOM fans on the internet—you lot need a real challenge. So here, I've got one for you: do you know the outcome of every single alien autopsy in XCOM 2?

Then Hitman returned from the dead, and everybody forgot about Styx for a while. But the fast-talking, backstabbing gobbo is returning in a new game in February. To celebrate his reappearance, Epic is giving away the first two Styx games on Steam. From now until January 22 , both Styx: Master of Shadows and Styx: Shards of Darkness are free to keep on Epic. Both games are pretty good sneak-a-thons, worthy of respect simply for how seriously they take stealth. While Styx can technically fight enemies face to face, he is utterly terrible at it and will almost certainly get killed. Hence, evasion, trickery, and shanking guards in the back are the best ways to progress. Master of Shadows set the template for Cyanide, in which Styx embarks on a series of infiltration and assassination missions across extravagant fantasy locations. Indeed, Cynanide deliver some impressively grand environments that let you take advantage of verticality in fun ways. The seq…",

The original version of Stellar Jockeys' shoot 'em up was a decent, if flawed affair. But the developer spent the next year overhauling the experience, delivering a new campaign and several other reworks that netted it a much more favourable Steam rating. The sequel, Brigador Killers, has been in development for ages, which surprised me as I assumed it was just Brigador on a larger scale. But Stellar Jockeys recently released some new footage of the game, which shows it is a very different affair from the original, almost like a mix of Syndicate and OG Grand Theft Auto. As it turns out, that isn't far off Stellar Jockeys' own summary of the experience, with the dev having previously described it as \"Hitman: Contracts meets GTA2\". The main difference is that Brigador was a dedicated mech shooter, whereas Brigador Killers lets players explore missions on foot.

Earth Must Die wraps you in the silken robe of VValek Lizardtongue, a megalomaniacal alien nepo baby who has just inherited the kingdom of Tyrythia from his father. Unfortunately, he's instantly lost control of his realm due to the invasion of robotic Terranoids that killed his father in the first instance. Naturally, Vvalek decides to take his frustration out on Earth, for reasons we'll presumably discover while playing. Like Size Five's previous game Lair of the Clockwork God , Earth Must Die is inspired primarily by the comedy point 'n' click adventure games of the '90s.

Under the forensic eye of PC gaming's modding community, however, nothing remains hidden for long. Over the last few years, The Witcher 3 mega-mod Brothers in Arms has restored hundreds of these cut lines (alongside other features like missing NPCs, restored books and journal entries). Brothers in Arms has been regularly updated since its release in 2021, with a new update reinstating even more missing dialogue from CD Projekt's cutting-room floor. These newly restored lines and cutscenes were highlighted by YouTuber xLetalis . The most notable is a new romance scene between Geralt and Yennefer that occurs during the quest The Last Wish.

But when I bought one, my character jammed it right into his flesh. Forbidden Solitaire is solitaire if you could cheat by shoving gems into your hand because an eyeball told you to. My first upgrade let me undo my last move, which ended up being pivotal when I fought the fleshy mass of human skulls later on.

Or if you used Claude to generate a few code snippets? Or if someone in marketing used ChatGPT to make a spreadsheet?\" It seems that Valve has also been contemplating these questions and has made a tweak to its AI disclosure form for developers. In its submission form, Valve now specifies that game publishers must disclose pre-made generative AI assets only when used in marketing materials or content that \"ships with your game, and is consumed by players.\" That's via a screenshot of the form shared by Simon Carless' GameDiscoverCo.

But Facepunch Studios chief operating officer Alistair McFarlane says \"games should never die,\" and has thus made an offer to buy it—and a couple other well-known industry figures have said they're willing to help. First things first: I don't know if this is a serious offer. It sounds like it isn't, but also like it could be—or, at the very least, that it might be one of those situations that starts out as a joke but then spirals into an actual thing . It's the sort of ambiguity I normally enjoy, except when it makes my job more difficult, such as now. Anyway, it all began when Facepunch developer Errn wrote on X , \"I tried to get Ali to buy NW for me but he told me to fuck off :(\" McFarlane replied , \"25m, final offer,\" tagging the Amazon Games account. He then followed up with the message, \"Games should never die.\" Not the most iron-clad, lawyers-and-contracts offer, no, but it did attract attention from some interesting quarters. \"I'll go halfs with you if we release the original NW alpha as a separate game mode,\" Pocketpair communications …",

Currently, I think it's more leaning into the aspect of social facilitation in that sense of our design.\" Technically, it's possible to make money in Arc Raiders as a trader right now, but it's a slow, manual process to group up with customers, load into a match, drop items or blueprints on the ground, and sell those items later. An auction house would cut out the in-person interactions, but Watkins reckons that would undermine Arc Raiders' intentional emphasis on finding items yourself. \"We put a lot of very, very deliberate effort into making the game about the items,\" Watkins said. \"We previously explored and even partially built a trading system like [an auction house].

However, if they happen to use a specific Bluetooth pairing technology from Google, then there is a possibility that someone could remotely control the device, tap into the microphone, or even track its location. The tech in question is Google's Fast Pair system, which allows compatible devices to connect super quickly (i.e. one tap and you're done). As reported by Wired , researchers at KU Leuven University in Belgium analysed a range of different audio devices and discovered that the Bluetooth protocols used were vulnerable to being remotely hacked. Rather than just your phone being hooked up to your spangly new headphones, somebody else could join the connection, entirely undetected. Once in, they could do something as innocent as change volume levels or, far more worryingly, listen to what the microphones are picking up. Worse still, if the device supports Google's Find Hub tracking network feature, the location could be monitored. As with all such vulnerabilities, there isn't just one hack, but a collection of techniques that can be …",

If you just want to know the nine kinds of quest, then here they are: murder, kill, the infamous fetch quest, collect, delivery, the often maligned escort quest, talk, puzzle, and timed. Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains. We all know what a fetch quest is—go here, get this item. A collect quest is different in the same way a kill quest is—gather a set amount of an item, like 20 nirnroot. A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person. An escort quest is similar, only you need to deliver a person instead of an item, so they're often trickier. All of The Last of Us can be considered one long escort quest. One that sounds obviou…",

And if SK Hynix's developments with PLC chips come to fruition, we could see a return to sensible SSD prices. PLC or Penta-Level Cell flash chips aren't a new thing, as Intel, Toshiba, and SK Hynix all started working on their development a little over six years ago. Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable. Flash memory cells work by using a large voltage to effectively ram electric charge across an insulated gap. Once there, it can remain stored for very long periods of time before requiring a top-up. Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information. That only requires the voltage sensors with the flash chips to read one voltage, which is very quick and simple to do. However, because it's …",
