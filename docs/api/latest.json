Sic transit gloria mundi. It's not just us singing the game's praises, though (but we are definitely singing them in a cooler way than everyone else). At the time of writing, Dispatch has an enviable Overwhelmingly Positive rating in its Steam reviews, numerous games crit garlands and, probably most significantly for its devs, it's set to hit its best-case-scenario three-year sales target in, oh, about three months. That's per Michael Choung, Dispatch's executive producer, who told GI.biz that, pre-release, AdHoc Studio had nurtured a dream \"bull case\" for the game's sales that it hoped to reach over the game's entire lifetime (which the studio's numbers guys put at three years). \"We're on track to do that in three months,\" said Choung.

Reaching an impressive 100,000 concurrent players in just the first half an hour and then doubling that within a day, it seems like everyone's hooked on raiding. Three weeks after its launch, Arc Raiders is still not letting up, reaching a new high over the weekend of 481,966 concurrent players on Steam . This follows a gradual but steady increase in players since launch. If you check out the Steam charts, then you'll see that only small dips appear on Mondays after a strong weekend. (Image credit: Embark Studios) But as I said before, the levels of popularity that Arc Raiders has managed to reach indicate that this wave of hype won't die out any time soon. Selling four million copies and counting, with more than 700,000 active players across PC and consoles, plus a community event that was completed in less than 40 hours , the raiding community is certainly an active one. And players haven't shied away from pointing out just how impressive this milestone is: \"Pretty crazy, hitting new peaks especially when the new COD and Tarkov 1.0 on Steam came out.\" Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Escape from Tarko…",

Baldur's Gate 3 had to deal with characters from Baldur's Gate 2 having canonical events happen to them between games, like Minsc and Boo being turned to stone or Viconia and Saarevok backsliding into evil, and now the cast of Baldur's Gate 3 are in the same boat. The latest Forgotten Realms supplements, Adventures in Faerûn and Heroes of Faerûn, move the timeline on from 1492—when BG3 happens—to 1501, and hint at the fates of its cast. Quotes from Karlach crop up throughout Adventures in Faerûn and she appears more than once in the art for both books alongside Astarion, Shadowheart, and Minsc. And in none of those illustrations is she a mind flayer or a pile of ash—two of the potential outcomes for her in Baldur's Gate 3. The best ending for Karlach is that she returns to Avernus with the Infernal Engine still burning away inside her chest…",

The trailer starts out looking like it could almost be a Witcher spinoff: The UI, music, voices, even the way the medieval city resembles Novigrad all smacked me in the face. Junior cadet vampire Coen has Geralt's signature messy high ponytail (but in brunette), and he also shares a name with a prominent book witcher absent from the games. The quest in question is a Witcher 3 monster hunt almost to a T: Coen talks to some \"cor blimey\" yokels⁠—with, I do have to say, delightfully craggy, varied, character actor-type faces⁠—who point him in the direction of monster-type happenings to earn access to a cathedral's library. Coen uses the exact same Witcher Senses as Geralt (down to the sepia filter and red outlines!) to uncover a feral vampire's lair, and the beast even cribs the Bruxa scream attack from Blood and Wine.

The problem, for PC gamers at least, is that Madness Returns has a pretty rough port that's only gotten harder to work with since its release in 2011; until now, anyway. Modder Wemino has undertaken the noble task of brushing up the port themselves, and released the initial build of their custom MadnessPatch Friday. It's remarkably feature-rich for a fanmade patch: not only does it improve textures, force subtitles to scale correctly above 720p, and adjust the camera for ultrawide resolutions, it also addresses crashes, fixes up broken physics at high framerates, and helps the game run in windowed mode without it throwing a fit. In other words, it's hard to imagine going back to an unmodded build. You might know Wemino from their other excellent patches: EchoPatch for best-in-class horror FPS F.E.A.R. and VorpalFix for the original Alice game, which I used (with great results!) for a recent playthrough. All three are extensive iterations, and this …",

Metal Gear Solid really blew the doors down, but it's the 2D, 8-bit Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 for Japanese MSX computers where the series began. You can observe the beginnings of Hideo Kojima's signature style, particularly in Metal Gear 2, and these are the games that actually show Snake's battles with Big Boss⁠—as well as body double and MGS5 protagonist, Venom Snake⁠—that would reverberate for the rest of the series.

In many ways, it's bringing together the best of Black Ops 6, 3, and 2, and stirring it in one giant pot to produce yet another potent brew that'll have me grinding Mastery camos once again. But in a year where Call of Duty hasn't been so challenged in arguably well over a decade, largely thanks to Battlefield 6 , it's the small changes that matter just as much as sweeping ones. That said, a co-op campaign, an SBMM-free playlist, more Mastery Camos , Hybrid Combat Specialities, and double jumps are a pretty good list of sizable changes, even if it's not a radical reinvention. That's cool and all, but I'm more hyped about Overclocks, one of the few major upgrades to scorestreaks since Modern Warfare 3 (the first one) introduced point streaks—and it's a callback to the maligned Advanced Warfare of all things. For the uninitiated, Overclocks are an upgrade system to apply new effects to your scorestreaks, field upgrades, and equipment. Each item has two levels, and the more you use them, the more you progress with them and boost their power. You can upgrade the Stim Shot to remove debuffs and boost your speed, increa…",

Such is the case with Vein , an early access zombie survival sandbox that aspires to be a hybrid of DayZ and Project Zomboid , and has quietly but consistently accrued an impressive following over the last few weeks. Broadly, Vein is a familiar affair, plonking you in an open world where civilization has been overrun by zombies and tasking you with staying alive in its sandbox. Like Zomboid, its appeal lies in its high level of granularity, with players able to interact with pretty much anything in its world.\"Open mailboxes, adjust faucets, and knock on doors,\" the game's Steam page promises, adding \"throw a can of beans at a zombie if you like.\" I do like. But all of this is presented in 3D, with dynamic seasons and highly perceptive undead. Even with a billion zombie survival games out there, you can see why fans of the genre might find Vein appealing. Even so, its launch has taken developer Ramjet Studios by surprise, so much so that it's having to readjust to compensate. Ramjet explained all this in its most recent w…",

That makes it more popular than Monster Hunter Wilds and Elden Ring Nightreign —at least as far as Steam is concerned. In short, there's plenty of motivation for Facepunch to keep Garry's Mod fresh, and its latest patch livens up how it looks and functions in several ways. Primarily, the November update improves Garry's Mod's water visuals, introducing fluid rendering features from more recent Source engine games. As the update's Steam post notes. \"This includes flow maps, lightmaps, and [the] ability to reflect 3D skybox.\" However, Facepunch cautions that the changes \"may unexpectedly affect a small amount of existing maps\" due to some map creators already using modified water materials pulled from newer Source games. \"This is unfortunately unavoidable from our end and will need to be individually fixed by ma…",

This mode unlocks once players win their first run with a rules-modifying memory card, giving you the option to play that run again while doubling the deadline amount, yielding a special reward if you succeed.

The graphics arms race is proving ever more costly for devs and players, with diminishing returns: The cutting edge Metal Gear Solid Delta left me feeling cold, especially compared to the similarly photorealistic, yet more vibrant, striking, and ten years older Phantom Pain. Meanwhile, people's champions like Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6 are scoring points with players by not just running on lower-end hardware, but looking and performing well . This isn't just a question of tech and optimization, according to Palalic.\"Good performance in a game isn't always a technical problem, it's as much of an art problem as well,\" he told me. \"A really strong art team can work within any shading and rendering limitations that are presented and lean into those.

One design shift I will never understand, however, is the bizarre affliction that struck MMO designers in the latter half of that 2010s-2020s golden age: The sudden and irrational belief that tab-targeting MMOs (or hotbar MMOs, depending on your accent) are old news, and that every MMO had to have some sort of action combat system in it.

As the series entered its second decade, it had already begun to veer away from historical drama and behind-the-headlines espionage. Treyarch was developing drone swarms for Black Ops 2, and Infinity Ward had dared to kick off the singleplayer campaign of Call of Duty: Ghosts in space. (Image credit: Activision) What Schofield was proposing, though, was something different: a futuristic moveset that would interfere with the fundamentals of CoD's sacred multiplayer component. Rather than merely providing novelty in the campaign, the boost jump would change the rules of competitive deathmatch, enabling players to reach high rooftops in newly vertiginous maps, and gain an edge through skilful combination of double jumps and mid-air dashes. If the idea backfired—drawing ire from a community which had grown used to its annualised fix of familiar FPS action—then Activision would be facing a serious threat to its most reliable cash cow.

Demand was still high to get the game on Valve's absurdly popular platform, though, and the day has finally come —though it was a bumpy ride getting to this point. In fact, it's still pretty bumpy: the launch is rife with problems. The Steam debut, which coincides with Escape From Tarkov's 1.0 release , has helped the game rocket to the top of Downdetector , which is showing hundreds of reported connection issues per hour beginning this morning. The user reviews on Steam are bringing the game's score to a \"Mixed\" rating as players describe their issues logging in. As user Icedecknight put it in their review : \"Negative review until I can actually play the game.\" The official Tarkov account on X has acknowledged the launch woes, noting in a post that the team is \"aware that due to high traffic, some players may experience problems connecting to servers and authorising in the game and launcher. Our technical team is actively working to stabilise the game servers and authorisation services.\" We thank player…",

More than just a level 1 enemy for you to kill and loot, they're a foundational monster of the industry, appearing in everything from RPGs to strategy games to point-and-click adventures for over 40 years. And how could you not love 'em? Three foot tall and full of mischief, with the upper body strength of a jellyfish—now that is relatable. So hey, if dogs , NPCs , and colons are all worthy of their own official PC Gamer quiz, surely goblins are too? All you have to do in today's brain-teaser is identify which game each of the fine goblins pictured is originally from. It's as simple as that—just watch out one of them doesn't try and steal your wallet while you're doing it. And just to get ahead of it: don't be coming at me with any \"technically that's not a goblin\" nonsense. I know one when I see one.

In particular, the Polish studio was deeply concerned about competition from another game released that summer, Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham Knight . The concern didn't derive purely from the fact that Arkham Knight was a hotly anticipated game. CD Projekt was more specifically worried that Rocksteady's open-world superhero game would shunt The Witcher 3 off the shelves at retailers. Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski explained the situation as it stood in early 2015: \"There was a big question about the execution of the marketing, are we going to be, you know, on par with, with the biggest out there?\" he said. \"We had huge, huge discussions, especially with the retail in the US, but also UK, you know, the main markets, Germany and so on, because it was about convincing them that we can actually be allowed to spend money in those channels.\" Nowakowski explains that retailers have different windows duri…",

The sequel, Salt 2: Shores of Gold , made some big improvements in that regard, while also enhancing the series' PvE focus and adding an infinite, procedurally generated world to explore. After spending the last three years in early access—during which Salt 2 gained a main quest, cooperative multiplayer, skill trees and underwater exploration among other things—it has now left alpha development , blasting a broadside of new features into Salt 2's hull to round out the core experience. Primarily, the launch update fleshes out the endgame experience for Salt 2. It adds a new NPC into the world who appears once players reach level 40, providing objectives for hunting down rare items players can exchange for legendary recipes.

One thing the original version of the mod didn't offer, however, is multiplayer, due to how FromSoftware prohibits modded games from connecting to official servers. But the recently released 2.0 version of Elden Ring: Reforged addresses this, with the team creating a custom server to enable fully functional, FromSoft-style multiplayer. Update 2.0 introduces pretty much everything you'd expect from playing Elden Ring with other people. Summoning, invasions, and leaving messages for other players.

So while chatting with Dogubomb developer Tonda Ros this week, I naturally wanted to know what was coming next. With so many games being made into movies and TV shows, and since Blue Prince is so densely packed with stories and mysteries (some of which still haven't been fully uncovered yet ), I asked Ros if he'd been approached about a film adaptation. Might we see Blue Prince the movie someday? \"I have been approached, and I regret to tell the fans that it is not something I'm currently considering. To me, Blue Prince is this one game or this one piece of art in the medium of games. And so I couldn't really imagine it as anything else,\" Ros said. \"I'm a filmmaker myself.

The problem? Fish, apparently. I managed to play a little bit today without a ton of issues, but I wasn't the only one who experienced severe lag. Blizzard's been trying to figure out what's causing all the problems since the beta launched on Tuesday, and discovered yesterday that it might be some new fish technology that's bringing Azeroth to a crawl. \"We're still plugging away at this but we think we found a new problem,\" game producer Zorbrix wrote in a forum thread about the lag. \"FISH!\" They explained how there's new NPC behavior that's supposed to help creatures \"react to players and the environment in a more natural way\" instead of randomly wandering around and that it could be going haywire when too many players are nearby.

      "body": "It's been a difficult few months for Destiny 2, ever since the release of The Edge of Fate expansion's Portal—a new progression system that replaced the old seasonal content model with, bluntly, a soulless and underbaked grind. I've written extensively about my problems with the Portal's many baffling design choices, but until now Bungie has only tentatively admitted to the size of the problem. A series of patches and U-turns have tried to soften the abrasive edges of the Portal's design—aimed at reducing the absurd power grind as well as making buildcrafting feel less restrictive and punishing. Still, these felt like temporary stopgaps—desperate attempts to staunch the bleed that didn't address the root issues at the heart of the new design. In a blog post last night, Bungie finally laid it all out: \"With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards. \"Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was …",

From packed office spaces, roads clogged with vehicles, and public areas overflowing with people, finding silence to think and refresh isn't easy. Researchers in Japan believe they have cracked the problem, though, by developing a GPU-powered active noise cancellation system that's powerful enough to calm an entire room. That's according to NTT Laboratories , as reported by PC Watch . It claims to have developed the \"world's first spatial active noise control (spatial ANC) technology.\" Active noise cancellation (ANC) certainly isn't new, and many readers will probably own a gaming headset that sports the feature. What makes NTT's tech different is a combination of the speed of the sound processing and how it can be applied. Headphones with ANC use microphones to pick up nearby sounds, which are then sent to a small signal processor. This calculates the appropriate 'anti-phase' sounds to generate, which are then emitted via the speakers. The original noise and new sounds overlap and partly cancel each other out, greatly reducing the impact of the noise.…",

A good friend of mine, a longtime PC gamer, asked me, \"Why the hell would I ever want something like this?\" My answer, simply, was, \"You wouldn't.\" But that, according to Larian director of publishing Michael Douse (and I agree wholeheartedly on this) is entirely the point. Valve isn't coming for committed PC gamers who know what they're doing and want the lights to dim when they fire up their tabletop fusion reactors. It's gunning for people who want Steam games on the TV without any dicking around. \"Valve are probably betting on the fact that anyone who wants more demanding PC hardware on their TV is part of the audience who know how to turn any PC into a Steam Machine,\" Douse, always quick with a well-considered opinion, wrote on X . \"Genuinely no point making a high-spec Steam Machine.\" Which isn't to say higher-end …",
