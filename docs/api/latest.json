A pale white octopus is swimming through the swamp to deliver my order of potatoes and rat meat. I'm using arcane magic to peer into the future to gain some extremely important knowledge: will anyone visiting my pub tonight have a hankering to play darts? I've long been looking for a great fantasy game where instead of a brave adventurer I could just be a humble tavern keeper, and it's finally arrived—and appropriately enough, it's called Tavern Keeper . Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it. Tavern Keeper's tutorial is almost shockingly brief: after plopping you into a rundown pub in a gloomy swamp, you run through the basics of how to buy kegs of booze and serve them to customers, hire workers and assign them jobs, and order supplies that can be cooked into meals. But that tutorial is just the start of a learning process that hasn't ended even after eight hours of play. There's a to-do list to keep both your customers and staff satisfied, from managing room temperature and deco…",

I'm old enough to have used my dad's PC to play games a few years before we got a dial-up internet connection at home, but I'm still too young to have ever internalized what \"online\" meant before the world wide web. Reading a recent blog by longtime Windows developer Raymond Chen, I realized that when '80s computer geeks used the term, its meaning was completely flipped. \"The term 'online' originally meant 'immediately available on a computer,\" Chen wrote, explaining why Windows 3.0 (which was released in 1990) included WinHelp, a program built for browsing \"online\" help files. Chen's explanation continues: \"If you are working on a system with hierarchical storage, the 'online' files are the ones that are accessible right now, and …",

For that notion to gain any traction for PC gaming, however, support for discrete graphics cards is needed. Say hello, then, to the Minisforum MS-R1 (via PC Watch ), a compact PC with an Arm chip and a full-sized x16 PCIe graphics slot. Game over for x86? Not so fast. For starters, the Minisforum MS-R1 runs a Cixin P1 CPU . It's a Chinese made chip built on 6 nm technology and configured with eight Cortex A720 performance and four Cortex A520 efficiency cores. In other words, we're talking off-the-shelf Arm cores first introduced in 2023 and part of Arm's mid-range Cortex A700 range, which is more about efficient mobility than outright performance. Arm's Cortex X900 series and, soon, the C1 Ultra, represent Arm's most performant cores of the moment. This is also a compact machine. So, even with that full physical x16 graphics slot, you're not going to be fitting an RTX 5090. Even a mid-range GPU probably won't fit. The slot is also limited to eight PCIe Gen 4 lanes, electrically, which is arguably suboptimal, even if, in reality, that's u…",

If you've been a PC enthusiast for as long as I have, then you'll probably look at SilverStone's new full-tower case with a warm heart and happy, fuzzy feelings. That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm.

Gamers are a cosseted bunch, and it was (heck, it continues to be) very rare that an open world didn't stick you right back in the protagonist's boots after credits rolled, so you could go mop up whatever side quests and activities you hadn't done yet. RDR bucked that expectation when it straight-up killed poor ol' John Marston at the end. Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish. Why didn't he? Because unlike RDR, killing off Niko just didn't quite gel with how Rockstar had set up GTA 4. \"You know, the game do…",

For the unaware, the Expeditions system is basically Arc Raiders' answer to hardcore players asking for regular account wipes. It's voluntary, unlike in Escape from Tarkov, but it'll reset pretty much all of your progression and effectively retire your character, letting you create a new raider and start from scratch every eight or so weeks. It's like prestige mode in Call of Duty.

What actually happened was that the game sold pretty well as an entertaining open world romp, and we all moved on with our lives. In other words, Ubisoft made an Ubisoft game . Nothing exploded because a Black samurai was in it. Gaming survived. Part of why Shadows' release was uneventful was, in part, because of Ubisoft's sudden pivot to, essentially, ' stop feeding the trolls .'

Other UI mods will stay untouched, but anything that gives you an overt advantage in a fight? It's being sent to the void. I can't say I blame Blizzard for this, even if I was hesitant at first . I still think the studio's taking on a huge task, given it's also having to completely redesign its classes to exist in an AddOn-less world, but assuming Blizzard can pull it off? I think the game'll be better for it. That's not to say there aren't bumps in the road. For example; some of those proposed changes note that Blizzard \"will NOT be allowing AddOns to support timer emphasis\". Say, for example, the 'three, two, one' audio cue that often comes with AddOns like Deadly Boss Mods (DBM). That's per an interview game director Ion Hazzikostas had with the authors of two major mods, Bigwigs and DBM.

But now, thanks to the games' new update, there's a lot more for you to navigate.

But my God, having now forced my partner to navigate the perils of the Roots update with me, I've seen that there is actually a lot more than just spiders and the standard status effects to worry about. Climbing through Roots is not for the faint of heart. The first challenge is the environment itself, as you have to rely on vines and bouncy mushrooms to get where you need to go.

Meanwhile, on the likes of Amazon, many DDR5 kit retail prices have doubled since August. The upshot of which is that while PC memory prices look unappealing right now, there's almost certainly worse to come. In really simple terms, there's a lag between spot pricing—which is the price DDR5 memory kit makers pay for DDR5 memory chips—and what we poor PC fans have to pay for actual memory kits. In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices.

Alas, it's just been delayed by a month, mere hours before its scheduled November 6 release date. According to RJ Lake at studio D-Cell Games, the delay is unavoidable. \"There’s a very boring and frustrating reason,\" Lake wrote on Steam . \"QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and not fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it.\" In other words, a rare progress-blocking bug was discovered at the eleventh hour and, because pushing updates to console platforms is much more time-consuming than it is on Steam, the studio and its publisher Playstack have decided to push the whole affair back by a month. Unbeatable will now release on December 9. That is over a month from the game's expected launch, which is probably frustrating for anyone looking f…",

And now Ball x Pit is slightly better because the November patch fixes a bunch of bugs, and as the top patch note explains, the encyclopedia has been updated with full-color icons.

The moment, captured above, was from Gates' keynote at the then-major COMDEX trade show a few months before Windows 98's launch. Microsoft's Chris Capossela was in the middle of demonstrating a novel feature—plug-and-play USB support—by hooking up a scanner, prompting Windows 98 to download its drivers. Then, wham: Blue Screen of Death. Gates takes it in stride, quipping \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet,\" but I always figured somebody got chewed out for the crash afterward.

A cottage industry has grown around simulating every job and activity it's possible to simulate: hairdressing, gold mining, home renovating, power washing, you name it. And inevitably, the people who actually do these jobs show up in the Steam user reviews to tell us how well the game matches reality, which is how I learned recently that firefighters do not, in fact, use the \"fireman's carry\" where you sling someone over your shoulders.

Sirland didn't respond to everybody, of course, but he did comment on a lot of the issues gnawing at players—maps, recoil, dispersion, and that laser targeting bug that's ruining the lives of heli pilots, to name a few. He also noted what fixes we can expect from the next big BF6 patch, which will arrive in the \"near future.\" Below is a recap of Sirland's impromptu AMA, broken down by topic. Bots A lot of folks complained about bots in Battlefield 6, to the extent that Sirland wrote a secondary thread outlining exactly how bots are used in the game. None of this is stuff we didn't already know—bots are used to seed servers as they're spinning up and are supposed to be replaced by real players—but he acknowledged that this proc…",

The whole thing first came to our attention by way of this Reddit thread, in which someone claimed that their friend had been banned from the Battlefield 6 community on Steam for posting a message explaining how to disable crossplay in the PC version of the game. Anything on the internet that begins with \"my friend said\" triggers immediate suspicion, but the image of the ban message looks legit, and more to the point the listed fix does apparently work. My friend make a post on steam about disabling crossplay on PC and here is a result from r/Battlefield6 This is notable, because while the console versions of Battlefield 6 lets players toggle crossplay on or off, the PC version—so I'm told, I can't run it myself so I can't check—cannot. Which seems very odd to me, although I suppose it makes sense if EA expected PC sales to lag significantly behind consoles: Maybe the worry is that if PC players limit themselves to their own pool, the relative…",

Serious fans were unhappy, though, for a number of reasons, foremost among them the music. Music in the original Plants vs. Zombies is dynamic, you see, changing with the events on the screen, but for some reason EA did away with that in the remaster—instead, it only played the \"high intensity\" version of the soundtrack. It sounds like a minor thing (even at its most intense, PvZ music is pretty not intense ) but holy cow, did people notice—including composer Laura Shigihara—and they did not care for it . Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted landed with a sub-50% \"mixed\" rating on Steam, quite a contrast to the \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating the old GOTY Edition holds. I created the music in Plants vs. Zombies with the specific intention of it being dynamic.
