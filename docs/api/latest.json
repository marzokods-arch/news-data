In really simple terms, it's similar to the the existing Ryzen 9 9950X3D . But as the rather ungainly \"2\" tacked onto the end of the model name implies, it gets another slab of 3D V-Cache added to the second CPU tile, otherwise known in AMD parlance as a CCD or Core Complex Die. The 9950X3D only has V-Cache on one tile. New Ryzen coming... 🧐🧐🧐Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 - 200W, 16C32T, 192MB L3 cache, 5.6GHz/4.3GHz.Ryzen 7 9850X3D - 120W, 8C16T, 96MB L3 cache, 5.6GHz/4.7GHz. October 21, 2025 The result will be fully 196 MB of L3 Cache memory. That's pretty nifty. But what about clock speeds? The leak claims the chip's maximum Boost clock is 5.6 GHz. At first glance, that seems a little odd. After …",

      "body": "The MSI MAG Z890 Tomahawk WiFi has been on the market for 12 months, as it was one of the first motherboards to be released alongside Intel's Core Ultra 200S range of desktop CPUs, aka Arrow Lake, in October 2024. At the time, there were few other models to choose from, but that's considerably changed over the months, and MSI faces stiff competition at this price point. The Z890 Tomahawk's original MSRP was $300, though you're more likely to find it around the $260 mark, and while that's not a huge reduction, it brings it more in line with boards from ASRock and Gigabyte. That's not the only thing that's changed since last year, as the performance of Arrow Lake has noticeably improved due to a wealth of microcode, BIOS, and Windows updates. In gaming, Core Ultra 200S still lag behind AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, though. MSI's Tomahawk series of motherboards has been around since 2018, as part of its budget and mainstream selection of products, sporting the MAG (MSI Arsenal Gaming) moniker. The Z890 Tomahawk WiFi sits near the top-end of the MAG pile, partly because of its price tag, but mostly because of the comprehensive array of features it has. That's because, as its name suggests,…",

Bloodlines 2's sidequests, on the other hand, are pointless, one-note tasks that will send you into a torpor. Every night, the primogens of Seattle's vampire clans sit around in their havens, waiting for you, Sheriff Phyre, to come and solve things that one of their goons should be handling. The absolute best you can hope for is some murder, being sent to kill a human in need of a beatdown or a ghoul who's gotten too big for its britches.

Yeah, we're talking bottom-of-the-barrel filler quests here—stuff that you'd even roll your eyes at in a quest-laden MMO. In a brisk 20-30 hour narrative-driven RPG, they're unacceptably bad. These quests are devoid of plot, have little to no impact on the rest of the game, and since this is an RPG without gear, the rewards are terribly basic.

In the World of Darkness, the universe in which Vampire: The Masquerade is contained, romance is kinda complicated. More complicated than usual, I mean. This is because vamps aren't human. Like Phyre themself says, the Beast—the demonic apex predator inside every vampire—hollows them out, removing human emotions like love. With that bit of lore in mind, let's dig in. Can you romance NPCs in Bloodlines 2? (Image credit: Paradox) There is what The Chinese Room calls \"romantic feeding\" in Bloodlines 2, but if you're looking for traditional RPG romance systems then you're out of luck. While vampires can retain some of their humanity—which there's a system for in both the tabletop game and Bloodlines 1, but not the sequel—in most cases their former nature gets squeezed out by the Beast, the source of all their darker proclivities.

See, that was the year Telltale reimagined the adventure game as a narrative-driven social conundrum with The Walking Dead. As a point-and-click diehard, I was sceptical of the change in direction. Telltale had been helping to keep adventure games alive after the genre fell out of favour, and now it was making the switch to something that looked like an interactive TV show. (Image credit: AdHoc Studio) In that first episode of The Walking Dead, my scepticism seemed justified, at least by the brain-dead puzzles—including one that involved an otherwise intelligent character not knowing how to use batteries. But I still found myself eager to follow Lee and Clem's grisly journey, wondering if the social friction could make up for what the puzzles lacked. Dispatch is an evolution of the Telltale style. Those last vestiges of point-and-clicks held it back, but Telltale became more confident throughout the series, and it eventually stopped trying to appease t…",

However, Masks—one of my favourite systems—nails it completely, and it's also in Humble's new RPG Bundle . This (up to) 27-item bundle from Magpie Games contains a couple of other solid systems, too—Avatar Legends (based off Avatar: The Last Airbender) and Root: The Roleplaying Game are included, alongside the gothic horror TTRPG Bluebeard's Pride—which sees players acting out different aspects of a newly wed's psyche as she uncovers the misdeeds of her new captor. I cannot recommend Masks enough. I kid you not, I am literally going to be playing my regular Tuesday game this evening. It's the third Masks campaign I've played with this group, in which I'm an Outsider who's starting to properly unravel her feelings about her people's past attempts to conquer Earth (they're aliens in a comic book, so they did a pretty bad job of it). Unravelling feelings is what the entire system's about, really. Masks is all about writing a comic book with your friends, rather than dealing 70 d…",

A simple enough concept, but let's just say this one spiralled a bit. And then some. This incredible desk contains 74 hexagonal frames, 44 of which house 37 active RGB cells. Each multi-layered cell can display its status via perspex inserts and multiple LEDs (via Hackaday ). Between the cells are pathways along which the bees travel, again with RGB lights. All told, there are 3,745 LEDs. It's all controlled by software that Full Stack Woodworking also built. And the resulting bee hive simulation is utterly beguiling. But hold that thought, because this labour of love deserves describing. This is a hugely complex desk build. Just making the top layer of the cell frames from African hard wood was an incredibly involved process, requiring several steps to prepare uniformly thin strips of wood ready to be laser cut. Full Stack Woodworking worked three sessions a day making the top hex frame layer—before work, after work, and before bed. And it took 25 days to …",

Earlier this year it released its ninth expansion, Grasping Fortune, and now it's gearing up for number 10: Poison Song . This is a big one. Well, they're all big ones, but this is a big one for a new reason . Poison Song means players are finally getting \"one of the holy grails that TR players [have] been waiting for more than twenty years—the ability to join House Indoril.\" This is either the most hype-inducing sentence you've ever heard, or completely meaningless (if you are normal), so let me try to break it down. Base Morrowind let you join any of three different Houses—Morrowind-native political factions that, conveniently, pretty much mapped to each corner of the Fighter-Mage-Thief triad.

That's per a post by Yoko Taro , director of the Nier games, to X. Taro was shown an image of a signed copy of the Nier Reincarnation OST being sold on Vinted, a site typically used for more noble purposes, like reselling clothes or old books. Mind, flogging a signed something-or-other isn't inherently scummy (times are tough!) but what isn't great is faking the signature entirely. \"This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine,\" Taro says, before adding that \"I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.\" Oof. This has naturally led to a flurry of people asking whether or not their autographs are genuine, or sharing genuine ones—which sort of defeats the point, though I imagine ol' Taro switches it up from time to time. The real moral of the story here is to not just trust any old listing saying they've got the genuine ar…",

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, \"This is a historic moment for several reasons. It’s the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in the United States.\" And although Huang would, of course, say this about Nvidia's own chip, it is probably true that Blackwell is the \"single most important chip.\" That's because it's far and away the chip that AI datacentre companies are clawing for. TSMC Arizona CEO Ray Chuang expressed the importance of the recent Blackwell chip: \"To go from arriving in Arizona to delivering the first U.S.-made NVIDIA Blackwell chip in just a few short years represents the very best of TSMC.\" None of this is to say that the Arizona plant's…",

Though the 8BitDo Retro R8 owes arguably both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses to that commitment. The version I have my hands on is the N edition. Based on an old school Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, to you and me), it's covered in a pale, warm-toned grey colouring, punctuated with a smattering of reds and blacks, plus grey on the base. It's perhaps the most interesting-looking mouse I've tested in years, and the same can be said about the translucent green Xbox edition . The second you pick up this mouse, you will feel every one of its singular design choices. The ends are angular, rather than the grooves we've come to expect from most mice, and the left and right side-buttons are recessed into the frame of the mouse itself. That means you have to get leverage over the opposite side of the mouse to get enough space to jam your finger in. These side buttons …",

From New Sobek City to Liberation Peak, fighters are fielding ever-increasing numbers of deploy beacons, thermal grenade launchers, C4 charges, and slam mines. You'll find very few who'll be willing to use the portable mortar's smoke shells, however, and that's because they're bad. Incase you were wondering how good the smoke mortar is 👀🎥tt/hypedreamzgaming#Battlefield6 | #Battlefield pic.twitter.com/zThTmuZI04 October 19, 2025 The LWCMS portable mortar system is unlocked for the support class at rank 49—the second to last piece of rank-unlocked equipment. In addition to lethal high-explosive shells, its description says it can launch \"smoke shells to conceal troop movement.\" Conceptually, it's easy to imagine the utility that might offer: If you know your team is about to make a big push, you can launch a preemptive smoke shell to provide some cover without needing to lob a smoke grenade by hand. But as the video from TikTok user Hypedreamzgaming shows above, the mortar's smoke shells only release a…",

Since when the Holy father has been on a bit of a tear about the nascent technology, calling it a \" threat to human dignity, justice and labour .\" The latest development comes from a Vatican seminar held on 16-17 October, called Digital Rerum Novarum : Artificial Intelligence for Peace, Social Justice, and Integral Human Development, with the Latin phrase a direct nod to Pope Leo XIII's encyclical letter Rerum Novarum: \"Of revolutionary change.\" Organized by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, who sound like a great bunch of lads, the seminar's participants called for a halt to the AI arms race, in-line with the Pope's call for the \"audacity of disarmament\" ( thanks, Vatican News ).

I have found why. Turn Uniform Infantry Aiming Off, scroll down to find zoom sensitivity smoothing, turn that off. Go back to Uniform Infantry Aiming, turn it back on & put the coefficient at 0!\" I wouldn't say my aim has felt off in Battlefield 6 so far, but I went ahead and tried Torbis' tweaks to see if I noticed any immediate difference. The verdict? Yep, ADS aiming on mouse does feel more precise now, though I'm not sure all the tweaks listed are actually necessary.

Today's update will disable real money transactions in The Sims Mobile, but will grant players unlimited energy to \"make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play.\" The game will roll along until January 6, 2026, at which point all Build Mode and Create A Sim items will unlock for all players, with no level-based limitations--everyone gets everything. \"We want to give everyone the opportunity to build their dream home, design their perfect Sims, and experience everything TSM has to offer before the servers close,\" EA said in the shutdown announcement. \"We would love to see what you create if you would like to share it with us.\" Seems a little weird to me that EA isn't just doing that right from the hop.

Scape and Run: Parasites (Image credit: VectorAce) Minecraft version: 1.12.2 Download: Scape and Run: Parasites If you want a horror mod to add more than one terrifying mob to your game, then Scape and Run: Parasites is the answer to your prayers.

      "body": "Welcome to the PC Gamer Top 100—our annual list of the best games you can play right now. For the last few months, the PC Gamer team has been busy whittling down the hundreds of thousands of games available on PC; campaigning, voting and arguing until we arrived at the 100 games you'll find below. It's a list designed to represent the passion of our global team of over 30 writers and editors. If you're wondering why Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire is back on the list for the first time in years, it's because Josh made a fully animated powerpoint presentation that he delivered to the team while dressed up as a pirate. Not everyone went to those lengths to advocate for their chosen favourites, but you can be sure every pick is a game that at least a few people on staff care deeply about. As always, the key question when creating a list of the best games is: What does it mean to be the 'best'? Is it a canon classic—a game that can't be ignored for its legacy to all of PC gaming? Is it an original idea, offering up something that's never been seen before? Or, more simply, is it a finely crafted masterpiece—the pinnacle of its chosen genre? In truth, the answer is that can be any or al…",

After telling fans (in the form of a random guy on X) that he was still working on translating United Front Games' magnum opus to the silver screen, he's returned to tell us the draft of its script is officially complete. The momentous news came, appropriately enough, alongside a shot of Liu and his own sleepy dog, though the shot of the script itself had the writer's name cunningly edited out. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride for this project, based on—if you've somehow forgotten—2012's open world crime game of the year. The film was originally announced back in 2017, with Donnie Yen set to star. Then things went quiet until Yen himself said it had been canned earlier this year. That's when Liu entered to take up the banner. The rights to Sleeping Dogs belong to the game's publisher, Square Enix. You might reasonably think, with Square Enix being kind of weird about its properties in general, that it might bear some responsibility for the movie's rocky road so far. Liu says that's not the case, though. \"[Square Enix is]…",

In the meantime I stayed up trying to find out as much as I possibly could about the characters and setting. When Little Nightmares 2 launched it took me a single day to get through. You literally couldn't have peeled me away from it if you tried. So, when the third game was announced in 2023, the excitement started all over again. Little Nightmares 3 is the first game of the series to be developed by Supermassive Games rather than Tarsier Studios. Despite this change, it certainly looks the exact same as the other two games. When you begin the adventure, you awaken in a strange environment overwhelmed by a feeling of dread, and everything around you looks gigantic to really emphasise how small you are as a child. The same goes for the various humanlike creatures you encounter, alongside the main villains, all of which tower over you. In previous games, one of the things that made the villains so scary w…",

Everywhere was hugely ambitious and backed by the staggering sums that Benzies' reputation could attract: Barb had raised £233 million by 2024, and by the end of that year boasted 448 staff. But it didn't have a game it could release and, with Everywhere's ambitious scope, a decision was made at some point to shift focus to MindsEye, which had begun as an in-game experience that was part of Everywhere. MindsEye released in June this year and has been a disaster. Within weeks of the game's launch there was news of mass layoffs at Barb, the true scale of which is only now becoming clear.

At this price point, I can't recommend a single 4K webcam on the market over this one, assuming you'll actually get the use out of 4K. 4K is still a bit of a niche even now. Some software doesn't support it, and others (like Discord) require you to have access to a subscription for 4K webcam streaming. Even if your software supports 4K resolution, a small cam on top of a stream on Twitch or YouTube generally won't justify such a high resolution. When some 4K webcams cost upwards of $200, that extra cash never feels worth it for my use cases. However, down to $100, it makes a lot more sense, and isn't too far from the prices of standard 1080p webcams.
