Whether we're looking at a big stompy battle hulk in the Battletech tradition or something closer to the Armored Core school of air-dashing, hover-skating war machines, we're an outlet more than willing to say \"wow, cool robot.\" For some of us, it's a fascination that runs deep enough to bleed over into the physical. If you've found yourself (or someone you love (sorry)) wishing for a more material mecha pastime, Gundam plastic models—or Gunpla—will get you there. A word of warning: Gunpla sickness settles in fast. I only built my first kit about a year and a half ago, but as I write this, there are two displayed mobile suits, three assembled models in boxes, and one unopened kit awaiting assembly in my field of vision. But if you're ready for your first dose of mecha-building brain poison—as brain poisons go, it's a pretty good one—there are some great Cyber Monday deals to get you on you…",

He said as much in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel yesterday—the same channel where he routinely shares insights and commentary from his entire body of gamedev work, including everything from the original Fallout to Wildstar and The Outer Worlds. The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't. To summarize, his argument is thus: canon is \"whatever the owner of the IP says it is,\" an individual's interpretation is personal and freeform and therefore \"you can't be wrong,\" and authorial intent is another matter altogether that usually differs from team member to team member, and may even diverge greatly from canon.

It used to be normal to play PC games with speakers, before we got obsessed with positional audio and wanted headsets with microphones so we could yell at each other over TeamSpeak. But you don't have to shrink your aural experience when you're all by yourself. Let your ears breathe! Below, I've recommended deals on two sets of desktop speakers I've actually used and like. My current pair is the Audioengine HD3, which don't go on sale all that much, so the current sale price at Amazon and at Audioengine is a genuine deal. These are the speakers I currently own. They look great, and sound plenty good for the size. The connection options make them very versatile: Bluetooth, USB, RCA, and 3.5mm aux. Get a bigger pair of bookshelf speakers if you're building an audiophile hi-fi setup, but for a warm sound in a stylish form that's easy to stick on your desk and connect to your PC or phone, I'm very happy with these.

The levels, too, are remixed into more straightforward shooting galleries.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. When I say Arc Raiders , the first things that probably pop into your mind are arcs and raiding. But a huge part of Embark's hit extraction shooter isn't as action-oriented as any of that. A big part of the experience is managing your stash and selling anything that doesn't make the cut—well, if you're good enough at extracting with all of your loot. (Image credit: Embark) But first, you need to know what to sell. Learning which items are worth the most Raider Coins will mean you can buy more parts and weapons when times get tough. And knowing which ones you'll need for crafting and quests is crucial so you don't get stuck later on (it'd be nice if the game told you this, unfortunately it doesn't). Knowing the worth of items will also help you decide what to take back to Speranza with you when you're looting Topside. So to test you on your Arc Raiders trinket knowledge, I've amassed a bunch of in-game items, and will be asking you to rank them from most to least …",

Like roughly half of the internet, I am fascinated by Kowloon Walled City . Built on the site of a military fort, the Walled City was a Chinese enclave situated within former British Hong Kong. Its existence was tolerated by Britain provided China made no effort to exercise its jurisdiction. This peculiar legal status left it largely ignored by both nations, and as such it became the site of rapid, unplanned urban development through the latter half of the 20 th Century. At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth. More than 35,000 people lived in an area of six and a half acres, giving it a density ten times that of Earth's most tightly packed cities like Giza and Manila.

And as Sektori's developer recently explained, the kaleidoscopic schmup is still a long way from making him any money. Reacting to Sektori's launch on Bluesky, former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen said reception to the twin-stick shooter had been \"awesome\" and \"much more than I expected for such a niche thing\". Lahtinen fully appreciates the highly specific appeal of Geometry Wars-style games, likely why Housemarque itself pivoted to making third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros. Now though, Lahtinen says the response to Sektori has given him hope. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. I went into this fully knowing I would never recoup. It would be my calling card, but nothing people would have ever heard of,\" he says. \"But 100+ Steam reviews, 97% positive + ~90 Metacritic is unexpected to say the least.\" Following this, …",

Introduced to Tempest Rising \"by popular demand\" , the superweapons take the form of base structures and come equipped with a powerful standard ability, plus the potential to \"unload devastating payloads\" onto your opponent.

There's been no better time to try it than its 15th anniversary, as the original game is going for just $1.19 on Steam .

You can also get the bundle with all the games in the series that made it to Steam for a little over $13. Thematically it's somewhere between a high school drama, Saw, and an Agatha Christie novel, with a psychotic teddy bear turning an academy into a prison of murder and mischief. While it is a visual novel, it's more gamey than the genre name perhaps implies: you investigate murders as they happen and try to pin the deed on the right culprit in a stylish minigame, literally \"firing their words back at them\" with metaphorical truth bullets.

Intel used to make chips for Apple, well, Apple used to use Intel CPUs, but those processors were based on x86 architecture—and, I'm sorry to say, were nowhere near as impressive as Apple's own M-series chips. Apple's move to making its own chips signified an end to its partnership with Intel, but also the beginning of a new era, one where the M-series consistently obliterates its competitors in performance-per-watt. Apple doesn't seem to be changing its mind where the M-series is concerned, though. This new partnership wouldn't involve switching back to an Intel processor, but rather it'd involve Intel manufacturing Apple M-series chips in its own foundries. Kuo revealed that Apple plans to use Intel's 18AP process node for this. (Image credit: Future) Ming-Chi Kuo teased that Apple's plan is for Intel to make its lowest-end M-series processor.

And if that happens, they'll need a cooler, because if there's one thing a good CPU can do, it's run hot. To that end, Noctua has just quietly shared some good news for those who are already on an Intel platform: its coolers will still work with Intel's upcoming LGA1954 socket. The company wrote on its FAQ page that the same coolers that have worked with the LGA1700 (Intel Alder Lake and Raptor Lake), as well as LGA1851 (Intel Arrow Lake), will remain compatible once the next gen rolls around. Noctua products aren't exactly cheap, but they're powerful, which is why we deem the Noctua NH-D15 to be the best CPU air cooler . But it's one pricey beast. It costs $180 on Amazon right now, and Black Friday PC gaming deals seem to have had no impact on its price tag.

So there's some real history there. It's no secret that a Control sequel is in development: Remedy said so back in 2022. Whether Control Resonant is that sequel is an open question, however. The trademark filing covers a lot of ground, from \"computer gaming software\" to \"printed matter\" like books and magazines, television shows, movies, music, clothing, and even, for some reason, \"lanyards for holding keys.\" It's pretty broad, in other words, and the title could be a reference to something other than a new …",

Well, here's an early heads up: The RAM apocalypse/hellscape/nightmare we're living in right now isn't about to get any better, says Maingear CEO Wallace Santos (via Wccftech ). Given how expensive RAM is right now, many gamers are holding off on their upgrades in the hopes that the market will improve in the next few months. It makes sense—when you're seeing RAM kits sold for twice the price that they used to be sold for, it's hard not to want to wait it out. The Black Friday sales have only highlighted this, when we look back at the offers around Prime Day in July—just over four months ago, remember—we've seen prices rising from $170 for a 64 GB DDR5 kit to at least $600. However, Santos says that if you want to get your upgrades, it's better to act fast. When faced with a question regarding memory shortages that could potentially extend into 2027 (oh, joy) and how to navigate rising prices, Santos said: \"For consumers that are interested in getting a new PC or upgrading their current system’s GPU, SSD or R…",

For those who have been following his channel for a while though, this won't come as much of a surprise. Eight years ago, a video titled \"Why I don't play video games anymore\" was uploaded to the PewDiePie channel, explaining the reasons behind the lack of Let's Play videos. Since then, his channel has adapted into more lifestyle blogging and the occasional hobby vlog. Of course, there are a few games sprinkled in, with the most recent video featuring Geoguessr. But aside from that, it's not the content you would've expected to see ten years ago. There's a good reason for this though, which PewDiePie explains in the November Kjellberg Mail newsletter. He shared, \"Since becoming a dad, everything does get evaluated differently. Every hour has weight now in a way it didn't before. One of the biggest things I decided to drop was videogames. But here's the thing: if I really wanted to, there'd be plenty of time for me to play videogames. I've just decided that, if time is limited, I'd rather be doing some…",

The disclosure indicates that AI has seeped into a fair chunk of the game, touching \"Background signboard textures, records illustrations, InfoCast videos,\" as well as \"Voices and music.\" Which is a real bummer, if you ask me. The original Let It Die isn't exactly a beloved classic, but it's a strange and unique thing, like so much that comes out of Goichi Suda's Grasshopper Manufacture studio. A very human game, then—a testament to the powers of what voice actor Jennifer English so recently called our \"beautiful, creative, human brains.\" Let It Die: Inferno isn't a Grasshopper Manufacture product, mind you. Its sole development studio is Supertrick Games, which (stay with me) is a kind of rump state of the original Grasshopper Manufacture.

Although the company's actual keebs don't rank on our list of the best gaming keyboards , the switches are in a league of their own—or they used to be, at least. However, Cherry seems to have fallen on hard times, with a net loss of $23 million (20.4 million euros) between January and the end of September 2025. This was with a turnover of nearly $82 million (70.7 million euros), leaving the company with more debt than equity. The future of its Peripherals division is also uncertain, and that's why it's hard to predict what will even happen to these keyboards in the future. According to Heise , Cherry is considering selling either its Peripherals division, which includes all its keyboards and mice, or the Digital Health & Solutions division. Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general \"peripherals\" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.
