But whaddaya know, it turns out it's actually reasonably achievable, as demonstrated by our host, Vik-on (via Videocardz ). While plenty of modders have strapped more memory modules to graphics cards in the past, it's usually been a technical exercise, rather than creating a genuinely useable GPU at the end of it. Vik-on, however, looks to have been able to double the VRAM capacity of their RTX 4090 successfully with relative ease. Key to this achievement is a leaked Nvidia BIOS, which gives our modder the ability to force support for different capacities and amounts of memory modules using Ada-generation chips.

This is a classy case, and, whether it's aimed at pro creators or pro gamers, one that many should consider for their next build—but not without some caveats. The initial draw of the PA401? Real wood. You know you've made it when your PC case was once alive. Each of the slats over the front intake on the PA401 is made from (sustainably sourced) ash with a glossy finish. So glossy, in fact, the grain is far less noticeable compared to the Fractal Design Terra or North. It's almost indistinguishable from plastic unless you're right up to it. Personally, I like it. The understated wood effect fits with the diminutive design across the rest of the case. But other members of the PC Gamer team thought it needed a little more pizazz. Altogether a simple case to build into, the ProArt stands out for the smaller details.

For which we all played our tiny violins, I'm sure. Anyway, Oracle's share price dipped slightly by the end of the day, putting Musk back at the top once more. I'm not sure what happens when you receive the title back—I like to think trumpets herald a messenger carrying your new, gold-plated, diamond-encrusted plaque—but regardless, Musk has reclaimed the position, despite a year where his Tesla-enhanced fortunes have experienced the odd wobble or two . The Oracle/OpenAI deal is said to be one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed, which is quite an impressive feat given just how much money is being funneled into AI computing in the metaphorical skies.

I'm aware these websites still exist, obviously, but there was a time where they were the raging heart of the prepubescent gaming ecosystem. I missed the boat on MUDs and grew too old too fast for Roblox and Fortnite, but I was born just in time to hit up AQ, Club Penguin, Fancy Pants Adventures, Line Rider… Simpler, gentler times. Heroes of the Seven Islands has me going full Ego-eating-ratatoullie. It isn't just a charming little game, it's also a time machine—and it's thoroughly sent me back to those halcyon, hair-filled years. It's a party-based RPG with a naive artstyle that looks like it was scribbled in MS Paint (positive). It was actually hand-drawn, though, lending an adorable sort of wobbliness to everything.

It also has a whole heap of packages—something that I very much like receiving, but don't have much experience in the actual, you know, delivery aspect of the whole thing. The little cat fella I'm playing sure seems to, though, as starting the game immediately plonks me inside a wee pick-up truck and I'm tasked with hauling my first package. (Image credit: Oro Interactive) It starts simple enough—I'm handed a box to load into the back and then drive a few feet down the road. Soon enough, though, jobs have me driving up and down the mountain through fog and sleet, while I anxiously watch the goods I've just grabbed slide around the cargo bed with every sharp turn and tire skid. Driving in Easy Delivery Co. is lonely, harsh, but weirdly comforting. There are no other vehicles, and as the night draws in my vision of the icy roads ahead dramatically decreases to levels that would make Silent Hill look…",

As for our thoughts, well, you'll have to wait a little longer for those . But to hear the other guys tell it, Gearbox seems to have (mostly) learnt the right lessons from the doldrums of Borderlands 3, turning out a looter-shooter with a great deal of satisfying looting and shooting, and relatively little tedious, meme-heavy humour. Here's what the rest of the world is saying about Borderlands 4. \"Every millisecond of a good scrap bursts with texture\" GamesRadar+ : 4/5 Our comrades at GR seem to have had a very good time reducing the denizens of Kairos to indeterminate goo.

As a gamer, I'm used to seeing flashy chairs from the usual suspects, but this was something different enough to grab my attention. And honestly, as someone who's getting on in years and feeling the toll of endless hours at a desk, I'm always on the hunt for anything that might make those marathon computer sessions a little less punishing on my back. Enter the LiberNovo Omni : apparently the world's first dynamic ergonomic chair that promises real-time spine support, motorized lumbar adjustment, four distinct recline positions, and even a built-in spinal stretch massage. The idea of a chair that could actually adapt to how I sit—rather than forcing me into its own mold—was enough to make me take a closer look. But is it the revelation we've been waiting for, or just a flashy Kickstarter moonshot with a few too many moving parts? Unboxing the Omni, I immediately notice its sci-fi vibe.

What's so visually impressive about it, at least to my eyes, is how it keeps balance and makes quick decisions and very human-like arm and leg movements.

Taking two hits of damage rather than the one we were used to in Hollow Knight (since it was so rare for an enemy to inflict two) has certainly been a learning curve for a lot of people. But that hasn't stopped the usual suspects declaring that the game isn't difficult and those struggling simply need to \"get good\". If you fall among this crowd, I applaud you and just know every time I run back to the Savage Beastfly arena I'm struck with a pang of jealousy. But if you're (somehow) finding the game too easy, fret not. There's now a mod that allows you to increase the double damage caused by some enemies to triple. The 'No Double Damage' mod created by TheLima does exactly what it says on the tin, but not in the way you'd think.

      "body": "Apple's new A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 was announced yesterday and the first Geekbench scores have been uploaded. To be quite frank, if this was a new x86 CPU for gaming PCs, we'd be losing our minds. The A19 Pro is scoring nearly 4,000 points in Geekbench 6's single-thread test. That compares with about 3,500 for the best AMD desktop CPU . And may I remind you, that's in a freaking phone. The A19 Pro in a desktop with the power budget and thermals that affords would be higher still, well over 4,000. If a new AMD or Intel CPU popped up in Geekbench hitting, say, 4,500, the internet would just about break. And to be clear, these Geekbench numbers for the A19 Pro are plausible. The previous-gen A18 Pro scores around 3,500 points in Geekbench 6. So, a 15% boost to 4,000 points for the latest chip fitted to a phone with a new vapor chamber cooling system doesn't seem like a massive stretch. Of course, Geekbench is hardly the perfect benchmark. And it's demonstrably not a game. But comparative real-world performance in applications doesn't tend to be a million miles away from Geekbench. The bottom line here is that Apple has long had a clear IPC or single-core and per-clock-cycle p…",

Where I might draw the line, however, is taking a sharp pair of metal cutting scissors to a brand new gaming handheld like the Nintendo Switch 2 —but then I wouldn't be able to fit a much bigger battery, like this intrepid YouTuber. Join me in saluting the bravado, then, of Naga, who's not only cracked open a Switch 2 on their YouTube channel , but gone at it with a pair of scissors to fit an 8000 mAh battery in place of the regular 5220 mAh unit. As you'd expect, the new battery is physically larger than the old model, both in height and depth, requiring a significant chunk of a thin internal metal frame to be cut away in order to fit it within the plastic chassis. Double points for fitting the weebiest battery possible, too, a bright yellow, anime character-emblazoned model. Anyway, after a handy bit of rewiring (and a quick clean down wi…",

That'd be the one where Henry infiltrates the camp of King Sigismund's army and solves a murder: heavy on sneaking about, investigation, and social skills. Unless you're cool, that is.

From the company behind the Hitman series, this third-person action-adventure game places gamers in the shoes of a young James Bond before he has earned his 00 status, with the agent needing to go on a globe-trotting adventure to fulfil his mission. And, from what we've seen so far, First Light is shaping up to be the first game in well over a decade that delivers the genuine James Bond dream of being a suave, slick-talking and fast-shooting super spy. First Light seems to be coming with a licence to thrill! (Image credit: Future) Our features in this issue don't stop there, though, as we've also got two other great long reads. First, we have a deep-dive into Raw Fury, the publishing house that is now famous for its exceptional indie catalogue of games.

Producer Roy Lee has now confirmed in an interview with The Direct that the first game is the inspiration: \"Netflix wants us to keep everything under wraps,\" says Lee, before pulling back the curtain the tiniest fraction. \"But it's definitely going to be based on the first Bioshock game.\" Lee was on the promotional circuit for the new Stephen King adaptation The Long Walk, and went on to say that Francis Lawrence will be moving on to direct Bioshock after the next installment of The Hunger Games. \"The Long Walk became a reality because Bioshock was delayed for a little bit where we had to do some more script work,\" says Lee. \"And so as the script work is being done, we shot The Long …",

It's also a brilliant excuse to re-open the reliably polarising difficulty in games debate. I can't remember there ever being this much buzz for an exploration platformer before, but aside from the aforementioned difficulty, there's probably a few good reasons why you might bounce off Silksong. Perhaps you suffer entomophobia? Maybe you abhor protracted boss run backs ? Or maybe you're just averse to hype and want to dive into Silksong once the buzz has quietened down and the post-launch updates have smoothed its roughest edges? If you don't like Silksong but do love labyrinthine 2D platformers, we've put together a list of some great alternatives. Silksong belongs to a very crowded genre, one that has spawned countless games over the last decade. What's below isn't exhaustive, but all come highly recommended if you're after something like Silksong with a different flavor.
