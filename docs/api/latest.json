The whole thing began innocently enough—or at least so it appeared. Keighley, host of The Game Awards, posted a message on X urging his followers to \"Check out #TheGameAwards nominee page on Steam to celebrate the best of the year.\" He attached an image of the Steam front page, which—because he was logged in at the time—revealed that he has precisely one game in his wishlist.

Now, it's hired the former narrative lead of Cloud Chamber Games, the developer that's currently working on BioShock 4 . Liz Albl joined CD Projekt last month in the role of senior writer on Cyberpunk 2 . Prior to this, she spent almost three years as narrative lead at Cloud Chamber Games working on BioShock 4, with her other credits including Ghost of Tsushima , Watch Dogs: Legion , and just over a year working on Monolith's cancelled Wonder Woman game . As spotted by IGN , Albl left Cloud Chamber in August—around the time the developer laid off staff after BioShock 4 failed an internal review , with its narrative criticised by 2K's executives in particular as the publisher committed to a development overhaul. BioShock 4 had already been in development for a decade before the review, with 2K announcing it was in production six years ago.

Simply put, I like the way the Stitcher, Ferro, and Anvil feel compared to competition like the Kettle, Arpeggio, and Torrente, among others. And that's lucky for me now that I've seen the maths behind it all. Content creator ' Min Max Lab ', who's been doing a bunch of excellent Arc Raiders science experiments lately, has worked out the efficiency of the most common and popular weapons by weighing up their max durability, how much is lost per shot, and how expensive each one is to repair. As cliché as it sounds, the results will surprise you. Firstly, my beloved Stitcher is the most efficient of the bunch, wringing out 13,700 damage/1950 shots per full repair at level 4, which works out to just two credits per shot.

Jagex adjures you to find \"new adventures and NPCs,\" to deal with \"new threats and face monsters from both the sea and the skies,\" and to \"Max out the brand-new Sailing Skill and earn ship upgrades with each new level.\" Also, \"Get to know the Tortugan species on The Great Conch Island.\" Which sounds quite pleasant.

It shows you visually and interactively exactly where different motherboards have different PCIe lanes routed. Apart from how many VRMs it has and how many I/O ports it has, probably the most important thing to consider with a motherboard is how many PCIe lanes it has routed to different areas. This is particularly important when you expect to use multiple storage devices or expansion cards. PCIe lanes are what your different components use to communicate with each other—they're physical, embedded routes that run through your motherboard.

Dailian quotes a Samsung report claiming, \"the 2nm first-generation gate-all-around (GAA) process has improved performance by 5%, power efficiency by 8%, and area by 5% compared to the 3nm second-generation process.\" At first glance, those are not exactly mind blowing advances. For context, it's worth noting that comparing nodes between companies is awfully tricky. Superficially, you might expect Samsung's new 2 nm node, also known as SF2, to be broadly comparable to TSMC's upcoming N2 technology, which has yet to be seen in a chip you can actually buy but is also ostensibly a 2 nm-class node. On paper, you'd also throw Intel's 18A node into the same category. Again, Intel's 18A isn't out yet but is due any day now. In practice, it's way more complicated than that. For instance, the very notion of the implied scale of \"2 nm\" is now quite disconnected from actual feature size inside modern chips.

It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side. Despite its poor technical performance, however, I absolutely loved my monster-slaying holiday, giving it 89% in my Dragon's Dogma 2 review .

Eagle eyed X user Brad Lynch spotted what may be \"the first 'official' Android app on Steam\" while poring over the changelist of, drum roll please… Walkabout Mini Golf . Apparently changelist entry #32325165 adds the game's Android .apk to the App Config, plus OpenXR support . Lynch claims the Android version will be available as an alternate branch of the Steam game's app ID, hence the two-for-one, no need for a separate purchase theory. He also theorises, \"If you own this game on Steam already, you will have access to the Android version on Steam Frame day one.\" This would be a very good thing for the upcoming Steam Frame . Valve's new VR headset can play games a number of ways: 1) playing a PC VR game streamed from a gaming PC; 2) playing a PC VR g…",

Well, it was actually created by Roman 'der8auer' Hartung , in conjunction with Jon Sandström of ElmorLabs , to make it easier for them to test motherboards, CPUs, coolers, etc. And since he just so happens to be the CEO of Thermal Grizzly, it's now something that I can use for the same purposes, too. For $269 ( direct from Thermal Grizzly ), you can have one as well, though let's be honest here: the Der8enchtable is going to be of zero use to the vast majority of PC enthusiasts. That's because it's simply an open-platform circuit board that you can connect a motherboard to, and separately control fans, pumps, and lights; it also provides external storage options so you don't have to use those on the motherboard. It might be a bit 'inside baseball' but let me explain why this is so useful for hardware testing. When I get a new motherboard or CPU to review, I use a basic open-chassis to mount the motherboard and PSU, then wire it all up, and then spend a good amount of time installing the operating system and …",

Now, as we've detailed on multiple occasions , FSR 4 Redstone is AMD's latest AI-enhanced upscaling platform. Broadly speaking, it's an effort to catch up with Nvidia's equivalent DLSS technologies, which have been ahead of AMD's curve when it comes to the use of machine learning in general, along with some specific capabilities that AMD lacks. The headline enhancement is more fully leveraging machine learning for upscaling, which is why, as we understand it and as the new AMD teaser trailer implies, Redstone will be tied to AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT . Only the latest AMD graphics architecture has sufficient hardware matrix math ability to run the AI code. Or so the story likely goes, anyway. Slightly confusingly, AMD has also said that Redstone can run on Nvidia GPUs on account of being developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology can therefore be \"converted\" into compute shader code.…",

Said rodent sits on your shoulder and speaks gnomically in a voice that sounds like someone unrolling an ancient, cursed papyrus scroll, and I already love him and want him to be my very best friend. The rat appears right at the start of the trailer, seemingly complaining to the player character about having narrowly escaped an ambush. There's a bit of rhetorical back-and-forth between the two, before the player commands the rat to return to the safety of his knapsack, as the pair move on in search of their destination—the Moon Gate. The rest of the trailer shows off a mixture of combat and exploration.

Hell, you could even just surrender if the map gives you a bad spawn point necessitating a giant trek across the map, if you're eager to get this quest done speedily.

While US president Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping late last month resulted in a pause on some of its rare earth restrictions, earlier global controls outlined in April of this year are still in place. These restrictions require companies to obtain licenses from Beijing before exporting rare earth materials out of the country, and the approvals granted to date are said to be for small shipments only .

For the uninitiated, transmog (sometimes called glamour in other MMOs) is a system that allows players to slap a new appearance over their current gear. In WoW, you used to go to a transmog NPC, create an outfit, and pay a gold fee to throw on your fit. This would essentially overwrite the appearances of those items with the ones you transmogged them to. In Midnight, that's all changing. You can see a handy summary by WoWHead here , but in essence, WoW's moving from this overwritten appearance system to an \"outfit\" system. And, while I'm about to do a whole bunch of grumbling, there are some major benefits to what Blizzard's put together. Essentially, the system—currently on the Midnight Beta—allows you to make outfits that can, at the drop of a hat (and chestpiece, and trousers, and boots), be thrown over your existing gear without having to bleed gold every time you get a new purple.

Much like levelling your friendship with the villagers, you can do this by giving up to three gifts per day, spending quality time with them, or brushing and petting them. Even then, you'll only get an XP boost once a day from these actions, and waiting until the next day when you want to head to the next area can feel like waiting a lifetime. When you hit level 2 with your horses, you can also assign skills to each pony like mining rocks, digging holes, and harvesting or watering crops which does give you another avenue for XP farming. But, as much as I love how efficient it is to mine resources and farm now you don't have to deplete your own stamina, it's by no means a fast process. Luckily, outside of gift giving and quality time, you can also work on your bond by riding them around and jumping over obstacles, but this process is still pretty arduous. Fortunately, I've found a hidden spot that, with a bit of decorating, can be a vital tool in levelling your horses, and make things feel much more efficient. (Image…",

The clearest inspiration is The Binding of Isaac, with winding dungeon levels, top-down shooting, and a cute-but-gross art style. The biggest twist is the morsels themselves. Each run you choose a card that allows you to transform into one—a kind of ugly little monster with its own unique attack style and special ability. New cards can be found over the course of the run, and you can hold up to three at a time, so you can shift between forms. But with that framework established, Morsels immediately throws you in at the deep end.

But if you're buying your very first GPU, then it can feel like an absolute minefield. Never fear, though, as I'm here to try and take the edge off some of those worries. And you shouldn't let any such concerns put you off, either, because the best graphics card upgrade will be the single most impactful change you can make to your existing gaming PC. It's not hard either. As an upgrade, it will likely be just a simple case of taking one big lump of graphics card out and sticking another big lump in, though there are some things you can do to make it easier for yourself, which I'll cover down the page. But once you have a shiny new GPU in your PC, it will feel like a whole new rig the next time you boot a new game. In fact, you'll probably want to go back and play all those games where you struggled to get 60 fps out of your old card, all over again. The big end-of-year sales are almost here, and we'll be picking out the best Black Friday graphics card deals if you need a little more help choosing the right GPU for you.

Doing this gets you the Aviator outfit (that one with the headphones), so it's well worth the time. In this quest, Celeste asks you to head to the Formicai Outpost on Dam Battlegrounds to do your flag waving. Finding the flag is pretty straightforward, but you might be struggling with where to hoist it. Either way, I'll run through the whole A Symbol of Unification quest below.

Eviden then covers networking, connecting AMD's components via its BullSequana XH3500 platform. The whole thing is being touted as an 'AI factory'. The hope is that all of this cutting-edge tech will mean France's first supercomputer will be capable of delivering \"more than one exaflop of HPL performance\" upon completion. HPL here refers to 'High-Performance Linpack', which is a type of benchmark to test serious processing power, such as what the Alice Recoque will eventually possess.

In the most recent update, which brings it to version 1.4, the sun vacuum from the console versions finally arrives on PC—as do more hotkeys, bug fixes, and Remote Play Together. I always wondered how people managed to play Plants vs. Zombies with a controller, and it turns out they had some help—a trigger-activated magnet that draws sunlight toward the cursor so you don't have to frantically zip around the screen trying to collect it while you're also harvesting coins and replacing tall-nuts. It's mapped to the spacebar in Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted now, and it's a definite improvement. Especially if you're playing at faster speeds, which is something that's now easier to modify on the fly. The tab key lets you cycle between different speeds, and hotkeys for the seed packets you've brought with you are now mapped to the number keys too. Which is nice. This latest update also gets rid of \"incorrect placeholder assets\" in the almanac, which players claimed had been AI-upscaled , and makes the gu…",

The trailer showcases the Hive Scum's crowbar, one of the class' improvised melee weapons (they can also swing a saw), as well as their dual-wielded guns. For the first time in Darktide you'll be able to go full Rise of the Triad with either autopistols or stub pistols. You can also dual-wield shivs in melee. The Hive Scum's other selling point is better living through chemistry. They can buff themselves with a customizable stimm called the Cartel Special and turn their drugs against enemies by throwing chem bombs and coating their saw in a variety of toxins. Like all of Darktide's player-characters the Hive Scum gets plenty of cosmetic options, with full-body tattoos and punk hairstyles, and they're the only class to have access to face paints so far.

You might think that all this anticipation was prompted by some big leak: Did dataminers finally discover definitive proof that Half-Life 3 is coming soon? Well, people claim to have found definitive proof of Half-Life 3 in every other Counter-Strike update, so probably, but that's not what prompted this week's hype. For the most part, the evidence in support of an announcement happening today seems to be: Valve announced Half-Life: Alyx on November 18, 2019 Today is also November 18 Half-Life 1 released on November 19, which is also a date in November Half-Life 2 released on November 16, and that, too, is a date in November Geoff Keighley posted a 👀 emoji Don't cancel your dinner plans, in other words.
