      "body": "Guild Wars might look indistinct among the many MMOs that arrived in the wake of World of Warcraft's genre-defining heyday , but it has relatively little in common with WoW or even EverQuest, the Iron Age big dog in the massively multiplayer space. It's a unique blend of deckbuilding and ARPG-esque adventuring where you can team up with other players in town hubs across different campaigns—a setup so unique it's still drawing a crowd over two decades, a very different sequel , and a big modernization update later. It's not an easy game. But, the question always goes, how can I make this harder on myself? An update arrived Jan. 28 with the answer: Melandru's Accord. \"Inspired by the community-driven Ironman challenge,\" the new game mode will require that players earn all their skills and items without the relief of player trading or mercenaries (special NPC helpers that copy character builds and gear). The full list of restrictions can be perused in the patch notes, but suffice it to say it's similar to the self-found modes you can try in World of Warcraft: Classic Hardcore and Old School RuneScape.

It's an easy recommendation to anyone with a passing interest in computer roleplay, and even easier now that you can get every game in the series (including the black sheep, Tactics) along with a boatload of DLC for $77 . That's almost as cheap as a crate full of puppets! That's thanks to a live Steam sale, which you can peruse at your leisure here if you're itching to figure out what all those Magic the Gathering cards are about. If you're not sure which to buy and would rather start with just one, here's the main series rundown. The original two Fallout games are top-down, turn-based masterworks that, while pretty old, are landmark CRPGs and furnished the series with its iconic juxtaposition of atomic age aesthetics, grisly hyperviolence, and sardonic humor. The first Fallout game is my personal favorite, and don't let its vintage fool you—as 90s RPGs go, it's approachable. Fallout 3 and the Obsidian-developed New Vegas come after the series was bought from the original publisher, Interplay, by Bethesda. These 3D open-world RPGs are both widely celebrated…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I play far too many games with a competitive ranked mode. I'm not sure why I subject myself to the horrors that unfold in these games, but I do, so rather than question all of my life choices, I've decided to lean into it. So here I am, asking all of you whether you can decipher the game purely by its competitive ranked logos, while simultaneously creating an opportunity for all this information that takes up far too much of my brain to be put to good use. I knew it'd come in handy somehow. Many of the rank badges will look very similar—eerily similar, even—but I have thrown a couple of curveballs in there to spice things up and add a bit of much-needed variety to the long list of bronze/silver/gold emblems. I'm interested to see whether this is just common knowledge or an early warning sign, so let me know how you did in the comments!",

The news came in a statement on X where McFarlane stated, \"From March, server owners will be able to opt in and only allow connections to players who have Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 enabled … we’ll be reviewing the metrics and expect to move towards making this mandatory across all servers.\" He added that these requirements are \"increasingly standard\" in the competitive multiplayer space, which is true. Black Ops 7 went for it , and invasive anti-cheat strategies that get all up in your operating system's kernel-level business are as apparently effective as they are sometimes reviled , despite the occasional terrible mishap (like one case where Genshin Impact's kernel-level anti-cheat was leveraged to disable antivirus processes).

I've always deeply admired cosplayers. I'll never forget attending Final Fantasy 14's Fan Fest back in 2023 and being absolutely star struck by how people had so beautifully brought their Warriors of Light to life—towered over by bunny girls with carefully-constructed ears and replicated job gear, and wishing I was also representing my Viera in the real world. Unfortunately I suck at arts and crafts, don't have a lot of money to get someone else to do it, and I'm just… well, a bit shy. It can be a rather vulnerable thing, putting yourself out there in the hot-glued shoes of a fictional character. But it's also a way to display your love for a piece of media, your love for the craft, and for the characters we become so deeply attached to.

And now, you can grab a whole bunch of them on the cheap, thanks to Humble Bundle's The Sid Meier Collection (which, really, should be called Sid Meier's Humble Bundle Collection). The bundle contains 10 Sid Meier titles, which, naturally, includes several Civilization games. The main attraction is probably Civilization 6 : Anthology Edition, which includes the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, plus the New Frontier pass. Also included are the Complete Editions of Civilization 5, Civilization 4 , and Civilization 3 . The latter two might be a…",

From Star Wars: X-Wing to Freespace 2 , whipping out your joystick to blow up spaceships in nausea-inducing 3D spaceflight was a formative experience for every first-generation PC gamer. Among those space sims jostling for supremacy was Star Quest 1 in the 27 th Century . Developed by Virtual Adventures Inc and released in November 1995, its defining feature was how it allowed seamless transition between open space and planetary atmospheres, which technically put it decades ahead of games like No Man's Sky. Sadly, this wasn't enough to make Star Quest a big success, and the game's been largely forgotten in the interceding years. Until now, that is. Three decades since Star Quest first appeared, its designer Paul Lauzon has updated the space combat sim so that it works on modern machines, and re-released it over on itch. Best of all, you can download it for completely free. Lauzon announced the game's rerelease over on Reddit . \"I’m the original developer of Star Quest 1 in the 27th Century, first released in 1995,\" he wrote in the post. \"I spent the last few w…",

Not resting on its laurels, developer Turning Wheel has fed this success back into the game, resulting in one of its most significant updates ever. Titled Instruments of Destruction, the update is so big it's being delivered in two parts. The first part is available now, and it makes some pretty big changes to the Ultima Underworld -inspired RPG. The primary change is an overhaul to Barony's magic system, which replaces its magic, casting and swimming skills (one of which seems unlike the others) with three new skills that oversee all magical abilities. Sorcery is all about direct abilities like fireballs and magic shields, while Thaumaturgy focuses on buffs, piercing arcane secrets, and going ham on evil spirits.

I remember looking for a mod to replace that with fuller animations back in the day and learning it would be completely impossible. (Deleting the door-opening animation altogether was on the table though, thanks to the Get On With It mod .) Given the whole process is necessarily artificial, it never struck me how bizarre it looks in the instant before the fade—when the NPC about to vanish lights up like they've just been plugged into the mains. As well as all shadows on them disappearing their hair looks super weird, vanishing from their eyebrows, sideburns, and the nape of the neck as the transparencies suddenly fail. Watching the video by modder wSkeever really makes it impossible to ignore. They light up like Uncle Fester with a lightbulb in his mouth, which is why the No Load Door NPC Fade mod is such a blessing. It's a one-kilobyte download, and immediately joins my list …",

We'll get to that in a minute. The difference is that this shadow war plays out across a detailed map of Earth and the entire solar system involving Lagrange points, interface orbits, and delta-v calculations for sending rockets to mine asteroids.

Far from a simple reshade or texture swap, this pretty massive undertaking adds 20,000 new world objects—from trees to plants, shrubs, fences, poles, signs, street clutter, roadside scenery and more. Moreover, outdated props such as phone booths have been whipped out entirely; while neighbourhoods have been given a fresh lick of paint or a new coat of grime depending on their economic standing—with Pluma's end game being to craft a world that feels \"alive and renewed, without losing the original spirit.\" The outcome is indeed a re-densified Los Santos and Blaine County, whose main thoroughfares feel refreshed and its peripheries reinvigorated.

It seems like Highguard may already be moving in that direction itself, though, as it's now toying with a \"hectic\" alternate format. \"We heard the feedback,\" opens the first patch note from the latest post on Highguard's Steam community blog . The new 5v5 mode was implemented just four days after release on Jan. 30, which is a pretty impressive turnaround time for something added in response to community sentiment. You don't have to scroll very far down on the Steam reviews or on the game's subreddit to see people put off by the 3v3 format, as in this thread from user mexicantacothief. It's easy to see why. The game's raid mode is tense and tactical at the best of times, but it never really feels like a 'raid': giant battering ram aside, it's still just six people fighting over a sword and then a handful of buildings.

Bans make picking and counterpicking more interesting and keep imbalanced characters off the field while players wait for a balance patch—and to my delight, Deadlock has finally got them. Well, sort of. What it's actually added is a “prefer to avoid” toggle you can assign to one hero from the game's roster when queuing for both standard play (which is always ranked) and Street Brawl, the new casual mode analogous to League of Legends's ARAM or Valorant's Spike Rush. You also can't avoid new heroes, which currently just applies to the six characters from Old Gods, New Blood . The patch notes, which you can find on Deadlock’s feedback forum , call this a hero banning system, but there are a few reasons for both why this is different and why it might be necessary for a game in pre-alpha. Most ranked modes in MOBAs have a draft phase—a pre-game lobby where both teams take turns selecting heroes for their team and banning them so that no one can play them in that match.

But the \"pirate queen\" of Morocco is finally receiving her due, at least in videogame form, as one of the playable heroes in Civilization 7 's recent Tides of Power Collection DLC—thanks in part to the digging of one University of Kansas professor. \"[Al-Hurra] is fascinating,\" says Finn Taylor, senior narrative designer at Firaxis Games for the 4X strategy title. \"She was highly educated, greatly respected by both friends and foes, and accomplished remarkable feats during a challenging time in Moroccan history.\" Her last name is actually an honorific title, meaning \"free,\" and is given to those who lead—similar to a regional mayor. When Amal El Haimeur, an assistant professor at the University of Kansas, ran across her name as an aside in a book, she was immediately curious. Sayyida was one of two women in El Haimeur's memory to hold the title, and the only one in Morocco. \"It became a research question for m…",

(Ok, we got Oblivion Remastered last year, but leftovers, however well warmed up, don't count). The Arthurian-flavoured open-world RPG recently surpassed one million copies sold, proving, if proof was ever needed, there's still a big hunger for Skyrim -style experiences. Tainted Grail kept players well fed over 2025 with a constant stream of patches, and Questline looks set to carry that momentum forward into 2026. With the release of Tainted Grail's latest patch , the developers revealed that a bigger update is coming in February, while a free DLC will be released to all players in March. Questline doesn't delve too deeply into the details for either set of plans, though it is slightly more forthcoming about the February update. This, apparently, will provide an \"extra pass mostly over act three, polishing many layers of the game\" including areas like level design and loot. This follows on from a similar patch last year that likewise polished …",

Now though, players can get their grubby mitts on it thanks to a glitch discovered by a YouTuber. Said YouTuber is JustGarrison, who, in a zingy twist of irony, stumbled upon the glitch during a pacifist run of Bully. JustGarrison's plan to complete the game without fighting anyone ran smoothly until he encountered Norton, a boss players must defeat during the mission 'The Tenements'. It's here where JustGarrison inadvertently unlocked the weapon—a sledgehammer that was previously only usable during the boss fight. During the boss fight, Norton tries to bash Jimmy's head in with the sledgehammer. But once Norton is defeated, Jimmy can equip the sledgehammer and use it to retrieve some key quest items through the medium of smashing. That's all he can do with it, however. He cannot take it outside. Like Greyfriars Bobby , the weapon is destined to remain by the side of its fallen owner foreve…",

But Project: Gorgon doesn't solely riff on the rules of the past. It has ideas of its own, such as an NPC relationship system and dynamic environmental systems that let players solve problems like being set on fire by jumping into a lake. Its main attraction though, is a deep, open-ended skill system that enables players to tailor their approach to combat. Potential avenues to explore include a grapple-based unarmed combat system, necromancy that lets you rai…",

The moment arrived during a press conference featuring Tottenham Hotspur manager Thomas Frank, a Danish coach whose witty asides are not quite papering over the fact that the club is having a terrible season. Frank took over in June last year from Ange Postecoglou, a garrulously amusing Australian who committed the cardinal sin of winning something with Spurs and was promptly sacked. Nevertheless the North London club remain one of the biggest around, and one of the players it's been heavily linked to over this transfer window was Antoine Semenyo. Semenyo instead chose to join Manchester City for £62.5m and, while Tottenham have made other signings, Frank was asked to address losing out on one of the club's main targets. \"It was clear, there is no doubt, that the cl…",

Also unsurprisingly, given his competing store and past criticism of Steam, Sweeney approves of the action, and based on his related legal tussles with Apple and Google, thinks there's something to it. The lawsuit, filed in 2024, very broadly alleges that Valve unfairly prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms and requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices for UK consumers. Valve had argued that the suit should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—but a Competition Appeal Tribunal disagreed, ruling earlier this week that the suit can proceed. Sweeney has homed in on the DLC issue specifically. Although developers can sell DLC on other platforms and have it carry over to a user's Steam copy, Valve doesn't allow them to sell add-ons directly through in-game stores or to use th…",

The Verge has heard from Pavan Davuluri , president of Windows and devices, who says the company needs \"to improve Windows in ways that are meaningful for people.\" \"This year,\" Davuluri continues, \"you will see us focus on addressing pain points we hear consistently from customers: improving system performance, reliability, and the overall experience of Windows.\" According to The Verge's sources, which are \"familiar with the company's plans\", these changes will occur \"in a process known as 'swarming'.\" Which presumably means getting as many engineers on-board as possible to \"swarm\" the most crucial issues and resolve them. If you use Windows 11 more than just every now and then and if you spend even a little time online, you'll no doubt already know what kinds of issues these are.

If you're struggling with the Dejected Assailant like I was, these tips will help you take Franz down so you can continue the main story. Franz the Dejected Assailant phase one I'm just going to level with you here. Parrying makes this boss so much easier. I know parrying sounds scary when the game showers you in shields and other defensive tools, but equipping a Forma that lets you parry attacks is basically a must against the Dejected Assailant. You can get one by talking to one of Jadwiga's Minions in MagMell next to the sparring arena. (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Other than that, make sure Noah is out on the field with you. If you try to duel the Dejected Assailant one-on-one, you'll have a hard time finding safe openings to deal damage, but Noah can help draw aggro away from you.
