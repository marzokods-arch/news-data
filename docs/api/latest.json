Rise of the Ronin, which arrived on PC last March after a period of PS5 exclusivity, was a mess : it stuttered, it sputtered all over the framerate gamut, it crashed a lot, and it didn't even look very good. That was the case even after Team Ninja apologized for their previous game, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, running like crap on PC . If you cast your mind back five years ago, Nioh 2 also had a less-than-ideal launch. Ninja Gaiden 4 ran decently by all reports, but the settings options left a lot to be desired . I'm not here to give a full performance run down of Nioh 3, but I've just spent a couple of hours running around in its newly released demo and I can confirm that I'm pretty satisfied with the way it works on my aging game laptop. It's far from a disaster! Here are the system requirements for the demo (and the full game): Minimum (1080p / 30fps using 'very low' settings) Recommended (1080p / 60fps using 'standard' settings) Processor Intel Core i5-10400, AMD Ryzen 5 2600 6 cores / 12 threads or higher Intel Core i5-10600K, AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6 cores / 12 threads or higher Memory 16 GB RAM 16 GB RAM Graphics NVIDIA GeForce…",

The show had every chance to continue the tradition by, say, just showing them in silhouette or by obscuring their face, but nope! There they were, on the screen at long last, putting to rest a long-standing mystery about their appearance. Last chance to avoid spoilers! With so much detailed lore about Fallou…",

As of last week, Deadlock's boasting an updated map, a new mode, all sorts of quality-of-life tinkering, and six characters gradually being doled out according to the whims of player base democracy. The update's best new feature, however, isn't mentioned anywhere in all that lovely web design. To find it, you'll have to crawl through some vents. Shortly after the Old Gods update launched, players discovered the Deadlock's updated map had peppered the streets of its necromantic New York with small vents, crawlspaces, and apertures that—while too narrow for most of the roster to traverse—clearly led somewhere. Once Deadlock players selected Rem , a spritely little dream-imp, as their first choice for the update's new character rollout, those nooks and crannies suddenly became much more navigable. \"An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams,\" is an adorable, nightcapped, candle-carrying crow-cat with a suite of sleep-related…",

First noticed by Shinobi602 on Bluesky , Bloober's countdown website at remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com (which as far as I know remains undeciphered) now features a stylized image of a rose, and the message \"Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.\" Put your cursor on the rose and it drips some kind of liquid—blood, I suppose. (Image credit: Bloober Team) There's also a similarly drippy \"play\" button on the page, which if clicked delivers a scratchy message that a quick search reveals is an overwrought recitation of a William Blake poem, The Sick Rose , originally published in 1794 as part of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience collection: O Rose thou art sick.

The biggest thrills you can find in that game are on horseback—galloping across plains, jumping off slopes, and blasting foes off their own horses as you circle each other like sharks. That only happens incidentally, though. At its heart, Highguard is a game about farming Vesper (money but blue) and loot in the open world, then overpowering the enemy team… for the first few minutes of a round, at least. Then it's about competing to grab and escort the Shieldbreaker, sort of like capture the flag. Once that's done, it's about sieging the enemy base; you plant bombs in their fortress, and they try to stop you by putting up reinforced walls, defusing the bombs, and holding out for long enough. By that point you're shuffled into a cramped base where the horse doesn't matter anymore, and you've kind of forgotten why you had one to begin with. The sense I get is that Highguard wants to make a smoothie of the most dominant competitive games' best ingredients—the role-based teamplay and tide-turning ultimate ability spew of a MOBA, the frantic scavenging of a battle royale, the wall-breaching tactics of Rainbow Six, and so on.

This session resulted in broad agreement among the group about what a succession plan should look like, and an explicit plan for what to do next (which has now started). A brief explainer of Torvalds' importance before we get into things. The Linux kernel development project has over 100 programmers each working to maintain and incorporate changes in their own repositories. But the final step in any Linux release is where all of this work is centralised and incorporated into the mainline repository: this has on almost every occasion been done by Torvalds. The succession session was led by Dan Williams, principal engineer at Intel and Linux kernel maintainer, who got right into things by describing it as an uplifting subject linked to \"our eventual march toward death,\" before offering to change the topic to Link tags if folk got upset.

Ubisoft announced the overhaul of its studio structure last week, a process that includes the cancellation of six games in development (including the repeatedly-delayed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time), multiple delays, and the closures of \"several studios,\" with attendant layoffs. It followed that up with a demand that all employees return to full time in-office work , and then initiated a 'Rupture Conventionnelle Collective' process in order to reduce the workforce at its Paris HQ by 200 people. Naturally, there was also fresh noise about AI . The Solidaires Informatique union called for a half-day strike at Ubisoft Paris immediately after the restructuring was announced, and warned that move was merely an \"initial response to the absurdity of management decisions.\" Now the union, along with four others—CFE-CGC, CGT, Printemps écologique, and Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo—are taking the next step: A company-wide walkout. \"We are promised autono…",

I'm pleased to say that, for once, I was wrong to doubt. The Steam-centric patch arrived last night, and—while I wish it hadn't taken almost a year for me to be able to write this—it certainly seems like a Monster Hunter Wilds performance improvement patch has finally, substantially improved performance.

      "body": "PC gaming has always been an expensive hobby, even if you stick to entry-level hardware. So much so that the majority of enthusiasts only upgrade their systems piecemeal, one component every so often, or get a new rig after many long years. But if you were hoping to build a new gaming PC or update the CPU and motherboard this year, the shocking cost of DRAM kits right now is making the process considerably challenging. Back in July 2025, you could pick up a 32 GB kit of DDR5-6000, with a CAS latency of 30 cycles, for under $90 (albeit during the sales). For AMD Ryzen processors, you honestly wouldn't need anything better, and although Intel's chips can handle faster DRAM, they'll still be just as happy with a kit like that. Now, the same set of memory costs $480 at Amazon , and should you want RGB lighting or DRAM from Corsair or G.Skill, then you'll be handing over a lot more cash. You can pay less, of course, as this 32 GB kit from PUSkill is $300 at Amazon , for instance. No, I've never heard of that brand before, either, but one reason why it's so much cheaper is its speed and timings. Rated to 4,800 MT/s and with a CAS latency of 38 cycles, this is a set that's only marginall…",

Mechborn is definitely that, inserting cards and turn-based fights into a world of giant mechs battling kaiju. (Image credit: Turtle Juice) It's a great concept, and the chunky visuals and hi-tech UI sell it well. With music that has more than a touch of the Pacific Rim theme to it, and surreal monsters right out of a '90s anime, it wears its influences on its sleeve—but it does them justice. A roguelike deckbuilder lives or dies on its mechanics, however, and heading into a run with an early build of the game, I was at first worried Mechborn might be style over substance. The very easy early battles make the game seem formulaic—faced with a deck full of 5 value attacks and shield cards, a choice of a starting item that grants a passive bonus, and very familiar buffs (strength adds to my damage, you say?), it can feel like Slay the Spire in…",

It's taking us back to a different time when one processor company was so dominant it could stand to release barely iterative versions of its top processors because it had precisely zero true competition. Welcome to AMD's very own Skylake era, an era where Intel's gaming processors are so far off the pace AMD can replace the best gaming CPU over a year down the line with a new chip and not actually make any changes beyond a clock speed tweak. Yes, we've waited 15 months for an upgrade to the old Ryzen 7 9800X3D and all we get is a 400 MHz overclock.

Long story short, SK Hynix didn't just sell more stuff. It made more money on every sale. This does not exactly come as a surprise. The prices of pretty much all memory-related products have been spiralling upwards of late. But the cost of producing memory products has surely not increased as much.

Then Peanut downs himself with a grenade, and another teammate stays by his side to administer first aid to prevent him from dying. He's only revived when the first teammate who ran off makes it to the top of Spaceport Tower, and for some reason, the snap hook triggers and sends the Peanut flying off towards that direction, soaring through the air: \"Look at me go! I'm flying, I'm flying.\" TheBurntPeanut new meta from r/ArcRaiders It's a pretty funny clip, and honestly, on the tamer side of things I've seen The Burnt Peanut do in Arc Raiders, but it does demonstrate how the snap hook still has some movement tech for players to take advantage of.

Though the company may have just won a very important customer: Nvidia. According to Digitimes , citing supply chain sources, Nvidia has signed on with Intel Foundry to manufacture some parts of its forthcoming Feynman chips. Nvidia will reportedly use Intel for only some of its chips, namely the non-core bits. It's said to be choosing between Intel Foundry's 18A or 14A process nodes, dependent on whether Intel has high enough yields to reliably produce enough chips on the latter. TSMC, the top dog in Taiwan, will still be leading the charge with the most important silicon, the GPU itself. Most likely on its A16 process node. Feynman is the next major architecture on from Rubin and Rubin Ultra, which is set to arrive from 2028.

In fact, although it could possibly be some peculiarity of my setup, it's in such a beta state that I couldn't get it working with the Huntsman V3 Pro. I installed the firmware for the keyboard through the separate firmware updater, and it was working with traditional Synapse, but no luck with Synapse Web; it just says \"no compatible devices found.\" It's not a problem with my browser, either, because Corsair's web hub works for me, and that seems to use the same WebHID protocol. YMMV here, though. Once the wrinkles get ironed out and hopefully more devices are added, it should be a massive boon for any Razer users who don't want to deal with what, at times, can feel like local bloatware.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. In the 1980s and early 1990s if you wanted a videogame with a decently written story, adventure games were the only place to find them. Back then RPGs were mostly dungeon crawls, or full of olde worlde thee-and-thou guff. Immersive sims didn't exist. Visual novels were rarely translated into English. Other genres would give you a paragraph of text and a pat on the back, then send you on your way. Because point-and-click adventures evolved out of text adventures they brought some of text's wordiness with them. When you wanted to adapt a book to a videogame, whether it was The Hobbit or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, adventure games were the way to do it. Studios like Infocom, LucasArts, and Sierra valued characters, settings, and themes more than anyone else. Of course to talk to those characters, explore those settings, and understand those themes first you'd have to solve the puzzles.

I guess when Hank woke up he admired her cutthroat (literally) attitude and made her one of Bud's Buds, which secured her a cryopod in the Vault. Alas, things are not going great for Steph in the present.
