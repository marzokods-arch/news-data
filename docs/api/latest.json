(For the record, our reviewer liked it quite a bit.) The update has sparked a new round of performance complaints, though, as quite a few players are reporting that instead of being improved, their in-game performance is worse than ever. One of the less-great things about PC gaming is that the nigh-infinite number of potential hardware configurations means that somebody, somewhere, is always going to have problems with a new game launch or update. In this case, though, the problems seem fairly widespread, with reports of diminished frame rates and increased stuttering coming in on Steam , Reddit , and X alike. Some users do say they've seen an improvement in frame rates, or at least that things are more or less the same. But, at least at this point, they seem easily outnumbered by players who say they've encountered the opposite effect. A few players have said clearing the shader cache might help clear up the pro…",

Right now the Konami stans are eating good, and the company seems determined to maintain its momentum. This week's Tokyo Game Show saw another \"Metal Gear—Production Hotline\" livestream, during which Metal Gear Solid: The Master Collection Vol. 2 was announced but not detailed (MGS4 or we riot), and we got a new look at Fox Hunt, a free multiplayer mode being added to Delta on October 30. Fox Hunt is about \"high-stakes, cat-and-mouse encounters\" built around Delta's combat and stealth mechanics. Neatly enough, the name is because you're cast as a candidate member for the legendary FOX unit. Matches can feature up to twelve players and there are two modes: Survival Capture and Survival Intrude.

It was almost like the old days—as close as you can get in a modern software-as-a-service ecosystem, at least—and my favorite thing about Battlefield 6 so far is that EA has doubled down on Portal. In Battlefield 6, your Portal 'server' will no longer disappear after everyone leaves , sticking around in the server browser as if it were a proper rental, and the developers have expanded the map and logic editing tools . In a recent correspondence with the Portal development team, PC Gamer's Morgan Park asked whether we could go so far as to delete all of the buildings in a map to transform it into a flat wasteland.

Well, the company's just announced another swish line of wired gaming keyboards featuring not only Hall effect switches, but also a tiny screen. Because why not, I guess? The Vanguard 96 range is giving me some serious deja vu, in part because the foundations of its design are very similar to the K70 series of keebs (and I reviewed the Corsair K70 Pro TKL last March). For instance, these keebs enjoy the same MGX Hyperdrive Hall effect switches that also featured in that earlier K70 range. That offers not just rapid trigger tech, but also adjustable and dual actuation (leaving my other half to wonder why the keyboard I've lent them keeps doubling up their key presses). The 96 in the name refers to the 96% layout, being a wee bit smaller than a full-size keyboard but still finding room somewhere for its rotary dial and 320 x 170 full-colour LCD screen. It is, in a word, 'compact,' though here's hoping that, once I get my mitts on these now available keyboards, I won't feel 'crowded' is more fitting. But hold up, this keeb is sequestering some…",

Arriving at the school with Shu and Rinko, you go to the back gate, which leads to a mountain pass—your supposed escape route from the horror that is encroaching on Ebisugaoka—only to find that it's locked. Instead of hopping over this shoulder-high obstacle, which is what I would've done, Hinako and her friends opt to enter the school in search of the key. While Shu and Rinko rest in one of the classrooms, you get voluntold to head out into the school and search for the key so you can escape into the mountains and hopefully outrun all the red spider lilies.

The Raspberry Pi 500+ is a fairly decent update on the previous Pi 500 , changing the basic keyboard for an RGB-toting mechanical setup, doubling the system RAM from eight to 16 GB of LPDDR4x, and fitting an NVMe M.2 slot to the Pi 5's circuit board. This last aspect is the point of note here, because of what software engineer and modder Jeff Geerling chose to do with it. Rather than use it for the intended addition of a small SSD, Geerling took advantage of the fact that the M.2 slot is just a physical interface for a PCI Express connection. That means, with the help of an appropriate adapter, you can stuff pretty much any PCIe device into that slot, and the Pi 500+ should recognise it. In Geerling's case, the stuffing comprised an OCuLink cable, an external GPU dock, a Radeon RX 7900 XT , and a mere 15 lines of ad…",

In less than 24 hours the project was fully funded and met its first two stretch goals: adding fishing, and a group of sentient fruits and vegetables. Not long after, Island Skies began to smash through its remaining stretch goals and exceed its $75,000 goal by $2,489,821, and pull in thousands upon thousands of backers. However, cut to three years later and the project hasn't come to fruition. In fact, the entire brand of Fluffnest is slowly disappearing from the internet. The store in which Fluffnest originally sold their plushies has been taken down, and attempting to access the game's official website takes you to a domain for sale. Basically, it's not looking good for PuffPals: Island Skies. As a result, thousands of backers have started taking to Kickstarter to request refunds for their pledges.

According to Digitimes (machine translated), Intel is reportedly raising the prices of its elderly Raptor Lake chips by over 10%, and \"industry analysts believe the price increase is likely related to TSMC and the lackluster performance of AI PCs.\" Raptor Lake CPUs, of course, do not have AI-accelerating NPUs. The latest Lunar Lake chips have low power consumption and high efficiency, which makes them strong productivity chips (and good for AI) but pretty weak when it comes to gaming. According to the Digitimes report, \"AI PC sales momentum is weaker than expected\", so those running local AIs are less prevalent than otherwise expected. The same is presumably true on the desktop side with the latest Core Ultra chips as with laptop Lunar Lake ones. Effectively, it appears to be seeing customers skip the latest chips in favour of the older ones. Digitimes doesn't note specific chips in its reports, but does clarify that chips selling…",

With PlayStation bringing more of its platform-exclusive games to PC over time, it's maybe not actually that surprising. The Pulse Elevate wireless speakers are a swish bit of kit available in black or white colourways. These speakers also enjoy planar magnetic drivers, built-in woofers, and support for 3D audio. They've even got a neat-looking, adjustable lean-back orientation when placed in the included charging docks.

Uncovered by Tech4Gamers , the AMD patent application explains that modern computing platforms have ever greater memory bandwidth requirements. \"Because the memory bandwidth required for applications such as high-performance graphics processors and servers, which have multiple cores and a corresponding increase in bandwidth-per-core requirement, are outpacing the roadmap of bandwidth improvements for DDR DRAM chips, improved DIMM architectures are needed to meet such requirements with current DDR chip technologies such as DDR5,\" the filing says.

It's primarily an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, where the masked killer Michael Myers hunts down four residents, though this time around there will also be a singleplayer component recreating scenes from the film. This seems to be very much the OG Halloween, with no nods to the many sequels in the first trailer (though I could've well missed some), and is I believe the first game based on the film since a curious Atari version from 1983. There's stiff competition in the horror genre, most obviously from Dead By Daylight (which has Halloween DLC), but Halloween really is a hell of a license: it's the quintessential slasher film, and everything from the killer's look to the stabbing synths has become iconic. In multiplayer, this definitely seems to work in the same way as Friday the 13th. One player is cast as Myers, who has various special abilities, is unkillable, and can execute players in horrib…",

That's the initial impression I got from this mouse: it's trying to innovate in a way that could actually be useful. And now, after spending some more time with it and actually using it for gaming, I'm happy to say it's done so pretty successfully. The selling point here is its 'InfinitePlay' hot swappable battery system. Much like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset , the Glorious Model O3 Wireless gaming mouse can boast a kind of faux-infinite battery life, because you can swap out its 200 mAh battery with another that's kept fully charged, then rinse and repeat, swapping between the two whenever one gets low. You slot an external battery into the rear end of the mouse, then when you see the battery LED on the hub drop to red and the mouse's RGB flash red, signalling battery is less than 30%, you swap it out for the one that's been charging in the hub. …",

First, some more details as announced at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 . Qualcomm has shrunk Snapdragon X2 down to 3 nm thanks to a newer production process from TSMC. That's essentially the enabler for everything else that follows. The 18 cores are all a new third-gen Oryon design that Qualcomm claims was started from a \"blank slate.\" The result is 39% improved per-core performance and 50% faster peak multi-threaded CPU performance.

This year, at least, we're finally getting Bloodlines 2, but only a few months later we'll be switching sides and hunting vamps down in Code Vein 2. During Sony's latest State of Play, Bandai Namco gave us a new trailer and a release date for the vampire-slaying sequel. The trailer says January 30, though on Steam it's listed as January 29 , which may be down to timezone nonsense. Now, technically I should be calling Code Vein's monsters revenants, which is how they're referred to in the series, but basically it's the same thing. In most myths and across fiction, vampires are almost always revenants, but not all revenants are vampires. A revenant, specifically if we're talking about folklore, is a spirit or corpse revived from death. Am I trying to define revenant because I don't actually have a whole lot to say about the trailer? I would never. OK, I do actually have a few things to say. The abilities? They look awesome. Weird, techno-organic wolves sprouting from your shoulders. A sword made of disgusting sinew.

However, Birt's Bees is one of the few legendaries locked behind side content, so if you haven't been thoroughly exploring Kairos, then you've likely glossed over the boss you need to farm.

Forza Horizon 6's teaser didn't give much away, mostly just showing a bunch of licence plates from the countries the series has raced through, but how could I not get excited by the end, when we see Mount Fuji? Sure, Forza Horizon 4 will always have a special place in my heart, since it made Blighty the star, and even let me drive around my old university haunting grounds in Edinburgh. There's nothing quite like playing a game and being able to point out a specific set of steps you once puked up on because you were 19 and couldn't hold your whisky. But Japan is an equally tantalising prospect, with its extreme terrain, densely-packed cities and striking vistas. Forza Horizon is always a looker, and I can't wait to see what Playground Games does with the new setting. And, of course, Japan is a serious car country, boasting lots of manufacturers as well as a vibrant racing scene. There's a lot more to it than Tokyo Drift. \"For a long time, Japan has been top of Horizon fans' wish lists, so …",

That's per a news story by Famitsu (thanks, Automaton ) discussing its upcoming October issue. Relieving me of a bit of my embarrassment is the fact that the magazine itself also seems surprised, here's a quote (via machine translation): \"Surprisingly, this game does not have what is known as a 'character gacha,' and basically, you can get all of the playable characters just by playing the game. Seriously?! … So, what are the in-game elements that require payment? Mainly the parts that allow players to customize their clothes, vehicles, homes, and more to their liking.\" In other words, this isn't a Genshin Impact—it's just shaping up to be a solid open-world, free-to-play RPG with cute outfits and furniture you can buy with money.

Pressing pedals from hundreds of metres away, the remote drivers monitor car movement over a video feed captured by four cameras on each vehicle's roof. These remote drivers' setup is giving me serious rig envy. Many of the picks in our best PC racing wheels guide are swish, but the setup here is a cut above even that.

After following Shu through fields and some abandoned houses on your way to Rinko's house at the northeast side of Ebisugaoka, you'll stumble into a cutscene that'll lead you to a huge field shrouded in fog, with the only thing in sight being a group of scarecrows dressed as students. The scarecrow at the front will have a riddle plastered to its face. Your goal is simple: read the clue and try to figure out how it relates to one of the other scarecrows that are standing before them. Picking the wrong one can be fatal, as these scarecrows will come to life and attack you, meaning you'll potentially waste your health and your weapon's integrity. The riddle and answer will differ depending on which of the three difficulty settings (Story, Hard, and Lost in the Fog) you are playing on, but it pays to get everything right, as not only will you make it out of the fields unscathed, but there's also an achievement for picking the correct sc…",

As reported by Bloomberg , and citing \"people familiar with the matter\", Apple and Intel are reportedly in the early stages of conversations about \"how to work more closely together\". No specifics are given on what investments are being asked for or what kinds of conversations are happening, but this is part of a broader comeback attempt from Intel. Intel has fallen behind in recent times, with the 13th and 14th Gen chip crashes only painting part of the picture. Its recent CPUs haven't been very good for gaming (while AMD has smashed it out of the park in that regard), and Intel admits it \" fumbled the football \" with Arrow Lake. As a result, a lot is riding on Nova Lake , and increased funding would certainly help it make an impact. More funding would help catch up to supply needs for any deals the company can make, too. Apple has a bit of a history with Intel. Prior to the swap to its own M-series chips in 2020, Intel was the central CPU supplier for all MacBooks and Macs. Apple also purchased Intel Mob…",

I've played Crimson Desert twice now— once at GamesCom , and another in April of last year —and both times I've come away unsatisfied. Not because I didn't like what I saw, but because I really wanted to properly cut my teeth on Kliff's moveset, which is about as expansive as any fighting game character's armory. Crimson Desert is the first singleplayer effort by Pearl Abyss, creators of Black Desert online, and while it has a Game-of-Thronesy aesthetic to it, that's just a thin veneer for the borderline Wuxia martial arts brawling going on under the surface. We see a little of that in the trailer. Somber, gruffly voiced monologuing barely holds together for a few minutes of sword-clanging before it throws a clockwork dragon getting chased by a real dragon and a goddamn mech-suit at you.

I couldn't do it. My Yakuza journey ground to a halt. From the hands-on time I've had with Kiwami 3, it's a remake that doesn't reinvent the original, but—like the two Kiwamis before it—polishes it to a shine, bolts on some fantastic new nonsense in substories and activities, and acts as a glitzy refresh for a generation that, perhaps, didn't get to it back in 2009. Meanwhile, Dark Ties—a bonus Gaiden game releasing with Kiwami 3 that has you play Yakuza 3 villain Yoshitaka Mine—acts as the wholly new red meat to draw in those of you who already know Okinawa like the back of your hand.

Others on the team didn't experience this bug, but I saw it pop up all the way through my time in haunted Ebisugaoka. Turns out my habit of switching off motion blur without even thinking about it whenever I see it in the options menu is the problem, which I wish I'd known 20 hours ago when I started the game. Leave motion blur on and apparently you'll never experience this particular glitch. You will have to put up with cutscenes locked to 30 fps, and a stamina-based combat system, and weapon durability, and one particularly daft twist, but there are people out there who like each and every one of those things.

Hershel, the two off-screen characters in the State of Play trailer explain, hasn't been around for five years, but is still considered one of the best. That doesn't mean she won't get into trouble.

I also know a couple of the Marvel movies have gone deep into R-rated territory and shown him popping his claws through people's domes.

I read X-Men comics as a kid for probably 10 years, and Wolverine killed plenty of people in them, and I even remember a miniseries of comics where he definitely put his claws directly through a dude's face. But I feel like that was somewhat of a rare occurrence. He'd slash people up, sure, but it was rarely all that bloody on the page.

Deus Ex is a PC classic through and through, and as such, fans have kept the original fresh themselves with mods. GOG will supply you with fan overhaul Deus Ex: Revision , for instance. The official remaster will feature \"new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,\" according to a post from Aspyr on the PlayStation Blog . They've also rebuilt the character models, added lip-syncing to the dialogue, and thrown ragdolls into the mix. (I'll basically never say no to ragdolls, so sure, why not?)

First revealed back in August , Title Update 3 will add Eorzea-themed hunts, equipment, and cosmetics, which—while appreciated—still leaves Wilds' glaring performance issues largely unaddressed. The headlining addition in TU3 is Omega Planetes, the FF14 incarnation of Final Fantasy's recurring mechanical superboss who's somehow managed to hop dimensions into the Monster Hunter setting. Considering Omega is a superweapon whose prime directive is dragon killing, its presence presumably doesn't bode well for Monster Hunter's largely lizard-based ecology, so it's up to the hunters to boot it back to its proper reality. Omega Planetes descends upon the Forbidden Lands in Free Title Update 3, heralding the arrival of the Monster Hunter Wilds x FINAL FANTASY XIV Online Special Collaboration!@FF_XIV_EN Themed weapons, armor, cosmetics, special actions and more await you from September 29! pic.twitter.com/lBrAPH0Y6s September 24, 2025 Like the Behemoth crossover hunt from Monster Hunter: Wo…",

To recap and according to Nvidia's own words, \"by using large language and speech models, generative AI is creating intelligent 3D avatars that can engage users in natural conversation, from video games to customer service. To make these characters truly lifelike, they need human-like expressions.\" Enter Nvidia's Audio2Face. \"Audio2Face accelerates the creation of realistic digital characters by providing real-time facial animation and lip-sync driven by generative AI, Nvidia says. \"Audio2Face uses AI to generate realistic facial animations from audio input. It works by analyzing acoustic features like phonemes and intonation to create a stream of animation data, which is then mapped to a character's facial poses. This data can be rendered offline for pre-scripted content or streamed in real-time for dynamic, AI-driven characters, providing accurate lip-sync and emotional expressions.\" In short, by open sourc…",

This is, I kid you not, just a partial list from Steam: (Image credit: Starbreeze (via Steam)) It's a massive collection that would cost hundreds of dollars to purchase in total—not an issue if you've been playing for years and slowly amassing the stuff, but an awfully heavy load for newer players. That's where the Payday 2 subscription option comes in: For $5 per month, you get \"full access to all available Payday DLCs.\" You can subscribe and cancel as you like—any progress earned in DLC content will be maintained even if you cancel your sub, so you can pick up where you left off if you resubscribe in the future—and all content will remain available for individual purchase as it's always been. \"With more than a decade of content behind Payday 2, we want to give players greater flexibility in how they experience the game,\" Starbreeze's head of …",

FiveM enables the use of custom cars, maps, and weapons among other content, but crucially also allows for a much bigger player count in online games. Together, these capabilities made it a key piece of software for GTA Online's roleplay (RP) community. At the time, fans hoped this heralded a bright new era for GTA RP. Then it all went quiet. But finally we're starting to see the fruits of that acquisition, and Rockstar itself is helping to promote it. \"Nopixel V is the next evolution of the GTAV Roleplay experience, created in collaboration with Rockstar Games,\" said the X announcement . \"Coming soon to the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms—stay tuned for more information at nopixel.net .\" \"We’re excited to support the nopixel team as they create the future of GTA RP,\" said Rockstar , retweeting the above.

And given Qualcomm is part of this particular conversation, that device would presumably be running an Arm chip rather than a traditional x86 PC processor. The venue for all this is Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 , where Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon had an on-stage conversation with Google SVP of Platforms & Devices Rick Osterloh. Google said last year that it planned to base ChromeOS on Android in future, as opposed to being its own stand-alone OS. At the summit, the pair fleshed out some of the details. \"In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,\" Osterloh said. That has meant, for instance, that running Android apps on a ChromeOS device required a virtual machine. But ChromeOS will now be a part of the overall Android stack. \"We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems. \"This is …",
