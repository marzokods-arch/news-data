A roll of seven when casting Prismatic Spray, resulting in the violet version of the spell, is described as causing blindness (\"WRONG!\" Sawyer hollered over a clip of this moment ).

Talking to PC Gamer associate editor Ted Litchfield, Fallout 3 lead artist Istvan Pely said it was an uncanny sort of fun. \"It's all locations that many people on the team were very familiar with. And we didn't take it seriously. It was fun to just be like, 'Hey, let's, let's blow all this up,'\" he said. \"I felt almost like, 'Wow, we're getting away with this?' It almost seems maybe borderline inappropriate, but it was just kind of silly fun. I guess we were immature enough to just see that angle on it.

I bought and played several hours of Liar's Bar, a game that utilises AI voices for its characters. Something that, at the time, I had excused as a bypro…",

Patch 7.4 hit Final Fantasy 14 earlier this week, bringing a conclusion to the excellent Arcadion raids. Not only have all 12 fights been an absolute joy to play, but the series has some of the strongest identity and cast of characters the game has seen in a good long while. That's thanks in no small part to each fighter having a unique theme song—something that is not afforded to every raid in this game—and I firmly believe the Arcadion series simply would not have hit the same without Soken's excellent and varied musical work on it. A world where I didn't have Bee My Honey permanently stuck in my head? That's a world I don't wanna live in. So tell me why, then, Final Fantasy 14, did you STILL manage to cram Machinations into one of the goddamn cutscenes?

Like most FromSoftware fans, I was resistant to the concept of an Elden Ring spinoff you're supposed to play almost entirely in multiplayer. I also recognised its obvious limitations. Despite being a roguelike all about team interplay, as you use your limited time to accrue as much power and pertinent passives as possible while journeying to battle the Nightlord, one thing stuck out to me: It doesn't have comms. Unless you're playing with friends through Discord, you have to limit your interactions to tagging. Predictably, this leads to endless frustrations and horror stories about incompetent teammates, plenty of which you can find if you peruse the game's subreddit. It's an important flaw to recognise, because if I didn't have two other FromSoftware-fanatic friends with which to play Nightreign, I would've quit. As you can see from all…",

But Straftat is also one of the best shooters of 2025, too, thanks to the immense amount of support the Lemaitre brothers have poured into, essentially doubling the map count since launch. Now, one half of Straftat's developers, Léonard Lemaitre, has announced a new game called Vholume , a Mirror's Edge style first-person platformer set in a vast, dystopian city. While Straftat is the easier reference here, Vholume arguably has more in common with Babbdi , which shares the brutalist aesthetic of both Straftat and Vholume. But was a moody single-player exploration game rather than a frantic multiplayer shooter. Vholume seems to be a solo experience too, but one that boasts a far more elaborate movement system than Babbdi.

A skitarii cyborg maybe, or a ratling, or an arco-flagellant. Instead, we got the hive scum. If you were hoping for one of those alien orangutans who are also scientific geniuses I can see how a new character who is basically just the gang punk who gets beat up by the hero in act one of an action movie could seem underwhelming. If you wanted to play a Sister of Battle in full power armor and were instead offered a normal drug addict, I sympathize. The way the Darktide subreddit immediately filled their nappies in rage over the hive scum reveal was a bit much, though. The hive scum wasn't what I expected, but after leveling one up, it's actually a super fun class to play. Maybe \"dual-wielding\" isn't as big a deal as it was in the Rise of the Triad days, but having a character class who can shoot two pistols at once makes clearing crowds deliciously easy. Especially when paired with the Desperado ability, which lets me reload for free, even when I'm out of ammo, as well as dodge ranged fire, and can be upg…",

It's also available on Steam for half off through the end of the winter sale on Jan. 5, if you prefer to keep your library in one place.

Early on there's one where you're hurled into a town as it's besieged by the undead, running through collapsing buildings until you can get to a ballista and shoot a shambling zombie cyclops. The next one happens when the magic crystal you're in town to deliver gets stolen right in front of you by a ghoul, and you have to chase it across rooftops in the darkness and rain. To keep up you jump across gaps, clamber up chains, squeeze through windows, and don't fall to your death as timbers creak and collapse beneath you. It's like the chase from Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth only in reverse, because here you're pursuing rather than being pursued and also you've got a snowflake's chance of getting it right first go. The glowing crystal leaves a trail of energy that draws the eye, and you've got a succubus in your head who gives advice like a cacodemon Cortana. Most of the time…",

Dishonored, for instance, is definitely an immsim; it simulates a lot of factors that respond to the player, boasts open-ended levels, and encourages all sorts of emergent shenanigans. But those same things are broadly true of Far Cry Primal, a game that probably isn't an immsim, or at least not acknowledged as one by immsim fans. How can that be? Well, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain took to his YouTube channel Monday to try and get down to brass tacks. It might seem like an odd subject for Cain to tackle, given that, as he notes in the video, \"so many of my hundreds and hundreds … of videos are me talking about roleplaying games because that's pretty much all I've made since 1993.\" He has even tried to define \"RPG\" in the past, which seems even harder than defining immsim because there are a hell of a lot more of them. But Cain said he sees a lot of overlap between the two genres' design goals and wants to hone in on a definition for both anyway. His definition boils down to th…",

I didn't like Dawntrail's story very much. Okay, that's not entirely true—I liked some of Final Fantasy 14 's latest expansion. I liked certain scenes, I liked certain ideas, I liked certain overarching themes; I especially liked the scenery. But the actual moment-to-moment storytelling was so clumsily executed that I was left genuinely baffled. It's a real shame, too, because the changeover from long-time writing lead Natsuko Ishikawa should've been a great opportunity to get some fresh blood into the mix. Ishikawa's been helming the story since Shadowbringers, and she's done a sterling job. I was open to a change, though, since I'd never expect a writer to stay in the same position on the same project forever. But Dawntrail lacked a lot of what made Ishikawa's writing great—a sense of weight and philosophical sensitivity, an appreciation for charac…",

Like anthropomorphic rabbits and Jesus, software developers love an Easter egg. Microsoft is no different. For most of its history, the Windows developer has inserted hidden jokes and references into many, if not most of its programs. These range from a Utah teapot that appears in Windows 95's Pipes screensaver, to a secret magic 8-ball toy inside Microsoft Access. But the most famous, or should I say, infamous Microsoft Easter egg is The Hall of Tortured Souls, a Doom-style 3D maze hidden inside Excel 95 that displays the credits of the designers who worked on it. Not only is it one of the more elaborate Easter eggs concealed in a Microsoft product, but this innocuous secret would also become the epicentre of a bizarre Internet rumour that Bill Gates was the Antichrist.

Once sold out, it will no longer be available.\" The disclaimer still there , and at least in the US, that original model is sold out for good. It may not have the delectable, vivid colors of the OLED version, but it was a hell of a workhorse for the price. PC Gamer's Jeremy Laird called it a \" stellar deal \" when the price dropped a few months back and I'm inclined to agree with him; PC gaming has a reputation for its high financial barrier to entry, so to have a handheld option with bespoke UI and docking functionality for under $400 was a pretty wild value proposition (even with consoles on the table). That said, there's a new handheld PC or gaming-centric Android what feels like every day now and Valve has hardware ambitions beyond the Deck, so it makes…",

Some are pretty easy, some are pretty hard, and hopefully some will make you curious to go play something you didn't get around to in 2025.

      "body": "One of the weirder things to happen in PC gaming this year was that a new Painkiller came out and pretty much instantly disappeared. I'm aware PC gaming moves so fast nowadays that many games get washed away without anybody noticing. But I thought Painkiller would have sufficient cultural cachet to stick around a little bit . Perhaps it's because Anshar's studios reboot made some major changes to Painkiller's formula, reworking People Can Fly's devoutly singleplayer horde shooter as a Left 4 Dead -style cooperative blaster infused with Doom Eternal -ish movement. The combination was ambivalently received by those who did notice Painkiller's release, with the game receiving a Mixed rating from just under 600 Steam reviews. The reboot did not go down well with Painkiller's creator, Adrian Chmielarz. Speaking to PCGamesN , Chmielarz says he played Anshar's reboot in beta. To say he wasn't impressed is putting it mildly. \"I disagreed with every single thing they've done in it,\" he told the site. Oof. Chmielarz is familiar with Anshar Studios, stating they are \"Great guys. They do a lot of outsourcing work, and every now and then they attempt to make their own game again, and I appreci…",

But its latest update— Stories Untold —expands the Zone itself, adding new areas and new quests to give veteran Stalkers something extra to do over the holiday season. The update revolves around a new mystery in the Zone, namely a strange transmission giving stalkers \"headaches, nosebleeds and even hallucinations\". The storyline becomes available after players leave the Zalissya region during the early game, in the form of a PDA message that can arrive anywhere on the map but is particularly likely to turn up around the Burnt Forest region. GSC says this new story adds \"over five hours of gameplay\" with eight new missions to embark on and seven additional locations to explore. GSC doesn't specify what these new locations are, but mentions that they are \"free to explore for everyone in the Zone\", so expect to encounter the usual dynamic events the Stalker series is known for.

Many Nightreign players, including myself, got used to running similar setups for boosting damage output as much as possible without having to waste too much time in a run. The shrinking, battle royale-style circle doesn't give you a lot of time to dawdle, so the meta revolved around a specific relic that gives you attack power for defeating summonable bosses around the map via evergaols—which is far easier than searching for bosses and hoping to find good random rewards. Here's the thing: The new map in the DLC features zero evergaols. The relic that lots of players have relied on to easily route through the map is unusable if you want to do the new stuff. You have to actually explore again and figure out an efficient route every time you drop in, which is made even tougher by how labyrinthine the layout is.

League of Legends has a reputation for being rough on newcomers, which is probably inevitable for a game that's been around for 16 years. To put that in perspective, you could've started playing before the Covid-19 pandemic hit and still be 10 years behind the real veterans. That's a big hump to overcome, but Riot needs to surmount it: LoL is still one of the biggest and most successful videogames on the planet (the 2025 Worlds had a base prize pool of $5 million) but the existing player base is getting older and there aren't a lot of newbies jumping in . The continued success of League is vital to Riot, because it's struggled on other fronts: In early 2024 it laid off 530 employees and closed Riot Forge, the initiative it launched in 2019 to make singleplayer League of Legends games in partnership with external studios.

But while Bungie's been hard at work overhauling Marathon's gameplay, it's also undergone a change in leadership: Just three months before its March 2026 launch, Marathon art director Joseph Cross has chosen to leave the studio. The Game Post spotted the first indications that Cross had left Bungie, reporting that Cross's LinkedIn profile now listed a 2025 end date for his position as Bungie senior art director. Cross's X account biography had also been updated, removing a previous mention of the studio. Cross has since confirmed to Kotaku that he is no longer employed by Bungie, and that it was his decision to leave the studio. I'm incredibly proud of the visual world we built for Marathon. Getting support at this scale for something a bit different is rare, and the art team at Bungie is the best in the biz. I'll be enjoying playing the game as a fan with all of you.

The backdrop of this conversation between Sam Altman and Alek Kantrowitz is the ' code red ' alert that Altman recently declared in response to Google's Gemini 3. OpenAI has had the lead for some time, yet Google's rapid improvement has seemingly worried the top dog of OpenAI. This is so important to the conversation that, barring introductions, it's actually how Kantrowitz sets up the conversation. Altman says that code reds are actually quite common for the company. He says, \"I think that it's good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges\". He also states, \"My guess is we'll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that's part of really just making sure that we win in our space\".

As per these regulations, TSMC can only transfer production tech that is at least two generations old to its fabs outside of Taiwan.

It's a modern aesthetic that proudly flaunts a touch of those lovable retro vibes, without being smothered in buttons and dust-catching greebles. The projector itself sits atop a seamless stand that grips it on either side. It allows for a 360 degrees rotation and 120 degree tilt for ceiling projection.

We all know it, and we've all felt the frustration that it wreaks, whether you're caught in a crunchy video call or watching a pal haplessly teleport around the map in Arc Raiders. However, it's now being used as an unlikely piece of evidence in another bizarre tale of alleged corporate espionage. Amazon began to suspect something was amiss when it looked at the keystroke data from a new IT hire. To the company's knowledge, the employee was US-based so there should have been a comfortably less than 100 millisecond delay between them typing commands on their corporate laptop, and those inputs reaching the head office in Seattle. However, the delay was in fact 110 milliseconds, suggesting the employee was based further afield than first thought. Amazon’s Chief Security Officer Stephen Schmidt communicated to Bloomberg a bizarre bigger picture. It turns out the employee with the lag was in fact a North Korean attempting to skirt international sanctions and funnel money back into the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (or DPRK) via remote work. After a few days of investigation and monitoring, they were ousted from Amazon's systems. According to Schmidt, the company has thwart…",

Last week I was: Appreciating player housing in MMORPGs. So—the Steam replay for 2025 debuted recently, giving every Steam user a more granular look at their gaming habits. And I, being a data-minded person, wondered: If you were to assimilate (most of) the staff of PC Gamer into one horrifying flesh-blob, what would our combined stats look like? Coincidentally, I have had a lot of my expenses requests for lab equipment rejected recently. Phooey. In lieu of being able to don my mad scientist coat and get all of my colleagues into a conveniently-sized test chamber, I have instead asked them for their numbers on their Steam replays and tallied them up in the ugliest Google Sheets table anyone's ever created. I won't be sharing it here, out of respect for their privacy and also your eyes. I have, however, got some interesting numbers to share with some disclaimers: I did not get the entirety of the PC Gamer staff in my net—just a decently representative sample of 19.
