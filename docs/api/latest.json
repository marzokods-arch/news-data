Solo devs and quintuple-A studios alike face all sorts of challenges trying to make all a game's moving parts cohere, and the more cooks you add to the kitchen, the more different design philosophies are bound to conflict. That's where design documents come in—living, comprehensive treatises that outline all a game's systems and design goals to be referenced by those working on the game—at least, for some. Johan Andersson, lead on Europa Universalis 5, said in an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens that the practice can be too rigid and restraining. For Paradox Tinto, good design comes with a bit of democracy. \"Design documents stifle creativity and it reduces people's ownership and empowerment,\" Andersson said. \"You create better games by talking with your team … tell the person some broad outlines, like 'we want this,' 'it should function like this,' a few samples, and let them make the detailed decisions. It creates greater ownership and greater accountability long-term in a project. Otherwise, you end up with a bunch of idea guys who write all the documents and the rest are there to follow. …",

Kato has so far streamed once on YouTube, playing through the early portions of Silent Hill f and leaving a nearly two-hour VOD that's racked up over 1.6 million views at the time of writing. Kato and her commenters speak Japanese, and I didn't feel like I'd get anything worthwhile out of YouTube's auto-translation feature (which presumably draws from already-garbled auto-generated captions), but there's a universal language of horror at work here that makes the stream very easy to follow regardless. Whether Kato's pulling away from the screen in a tense moment, mimicking her character's actions in real life, or struggling to line up a fiddly action button prompt during a chase sequence, we've all been there playing a horror game. One great moment I particularly empathized with was when Kato relaxed during a long cutscene, only to have to scramble to attention when it surprise transitioned back to gameplay. …",

And while it's nice to know Boltgun 2 is in development, it's nicer to know a bit about what it will actually contain. The latest trailer does just that, by informing us that Boltgun 2 will let us choose a second playable character. That character being Nyra Veyrath, a Celestian of the Sisters of Battle, to be specific. She wields a bolt pistol/power sword combo, switching to a meltagun or flamer when the enemies of the Imperium need a good superheating, and has some good mobility, with a slide move I couldn't imagine the bulky space marine Malum Caedo pulling off. As well as letting us choose between two protagonists, Boltgun 2 will have a branching campaign, with different decisions leading you through different levels. It'll also have more biomes than the first game, including a jungle swamp and a hive city to fight through. Looks like there's an ice world too? I just hope I don't get lost in the levels as often as I did in the original. Boltgun 2 will be out in 2026, and available on Steam . I'm sure the internet will be completely normal abou…",

When PC Gamer news writer Lincoln Carpenter gave the game a spin, he conceded he thought the game was an elaborate bit at first. It won him over, though, as he said his impressions: \"Under its deceptive meme game veneer, Escape From Duckov is an excellent topdown shooter that smartly repackages the extraction shooter in a satisfying singleplayer format.\" Singleplayer extraction shooter might sound like a bit of an oxymoron—the genre is all about evading other players to escape with your life and loot—but Duckov is stuffed with all sorts of quests and a base to kit out with upgrades, essentially squeezing the genre into the framework of a roguelite RPG.

But before it had solidified that reputation, it was trying to make a name in other genres. Trying, and failing spectacularly. In an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens , Andersson recalled one of the studio's earliest games: \"If you want to laugh, Google Valhalla Chronicles. We had the best comment ever on that one: 'bugs, many and diverse, some more interesting than the gameplay.'\" It's not a looker. But as Andersson explained, the team was \"doing multiple games at the same time\" and its take on a Baldur's Gate-inspired RPG \"did not turn out great. \"We did a lot of games with a small team of like five, six people for the first, like 10 years,\" he said. \"We became Paradox in 1999 and Paradox Interactive in 2005.

No videogame genre has birthed more bangers than the humble JRPG. I mean, come on, can you even imagine a world where a track like One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy 7 doesn't exist? Or where we never got to hear a real monk chanting absolute bars over Metaphor: ReFantazio's orchestral battle theme? A timeline where we never get to experience the delicate piano of Kingdom Hearts' Dearly Beloved washing over us when booting up the game? I certainly can't, which is why I maintain that JRPG music is some of the best in the biz. It kind of has to be, really. Not only will they probably be some of the longest videogames you ever play—hello to my triple-digit Persona 5 Royal playtime—but they'll also probably take you through every feeling you could ever experience.

From the first moment you step foot on Paradise Island, you'll start discovering all sorts of strange murder contraptions, from a sniper rifle that fires sneaky explosive bolts you detonate when you reload, to a pistol that infects enemies with a contagious disease they can spread. The strangest weapon by far that I've discovered in my travels through Arcadia, though, is a sword that turns combat into a rhythm game. Yes, you read that correctly—if you don't slash and slice to the old timey beat, you won't gain its bonus. This sword might seem like a bit of a meme at first, but when fully powered up, I'm convinced it might be the best melee weapon in the game. The Spectrum Dance Saber, as it's called, is quite hard to get. You'll first have to complete an elaborate collectible quest to unlock it, and even then it'll set you back 16,500 bits , making it by far the most expensive weapon I've found in the game.

Before it shut down in 2022 , it was a relic of a time when MOBAs hadn't really proved their staying power yet; and now, somehow, it's back. First announced nine months ago , Heroes of Newerth: Reborn is a relaunch-slash-remaster of the defunct MOBA. A trailer dropped Wednesday announcing a free open beta starting on Nov. 11, and it certainly looks like HoN. While League of Legends was a fully original game with its own heroes and items, HoN was much closer to DotA (albeit with a trashier sense of humor). In May 2010, Dota was still just an old Warcraft 3 mod, so HoN had its niche among players who didn't like League's snappier, skill shot-oriented action. All this makes the re-release sort of a headscratcher for any outside of Newerth's niche fanbase.

Not because it's informative, or the community is a lovely bunch, though both of those things are true. It's the best because it has thread titles like \"My son became a German and now my empire is dying\", constant grousing about whatever the Pope's getting up to, and endless hand-rubbing about what to do (or what not to do) with wives, heirs, and all those vassals any self-respecting Crusader King collects. This week's quiz is a simple one. There are 15 thread titles here. To prove your worth, separate the real from the made up. One note: Kwizly has a hint system that doesn't work very well with yes/no quizzes like this.

Our selection changes substantially year-to-year as the PC Gamer team grows, tastes change, and classics are reevaluated. In 2012, Skyrim was #1. This year, it didn't make the cut at all.

(Image credit: The Chinese Room) More than a mistake, it was a disservice to the game itself. Here's the thing: I very much enjoyed Bloodlines 2. It's a great Vampire: The Masquerade game, dripping with atmosphere, vibrating with conspiracies, and hell, the combat can even be pretty fun when you're absolutely clowning on a gaggle of ghouls with your elder vampire abilities. But I say 'it's a great V:TM game' deliberately. It's a great Vampire game, but not a great Bloodlines game, and that latter name only ever detracts from the game we ended up getting 21 years after an RPG that people are still replaying today. Every attempt—sparse as those attempts were—to retrofit The Chinese R…",

Odds are he directed it. Since starting at Paradox in 1998, his life has been one slice of history after another. \"The first thing when you say [it's been over 25 years] is, like, 'Holy shit! It's been that long?'\" Andersson tells me over video chat. \"But then again, I look at the screen here and realise, 'Okay, I have grey hair now, and I didn't have that when I started.'\" (Image credit: Paradox) Now 51 years old, Andersson was a bright-eyed 20-something when he started work on his first Paradox game, Europa Universalis 1. \"It's kind of interesting to have been able to be there from when we were basically a few people, just coding on something that was completely different than today's hardware, doing something that in today's world is very, very simple. \"Take it to today, 25 years later, [it's] much more advanced, much different.\" Gone are the 50-pound monitors, gone are the…",

From pleasant aesthetics, to solid ease of use, to the recent addition of tidy charging docks, my desk is currently covered in tech from the company. And that's for good reason. My 8BitDo Retro R8 isn't as competitively viable as the Logitech I swapped it out for, but it is more convenient. The Retro mechanical keyboard doesn't have rapid trigger, but it does have a few programmable keys and a solid feel. The 8BitDo Pro 3 carries on this tradition, but makes a few more compromises than its desk buddies. The controller I've been testing comes in a purple variant, with red and green face buttons, and is very clearly inspired by the Nintendo GameCube. Looking like tech from a few decades ago is sort of 8BitDo's shtick, and 8BitDo does it better than pretty much anyone else. The Pro 3 looks delightful, both on and off its charging stand, and that charging stand adds more than just an ornament to a room. It comes with a compartment underneath to plug in a 2.4 GHz dongle, which means, if you plug the dock into your PC, it will both charge your controller and work as your connector.

Given each game has 87 bazillion guns (give or take a bazillion), shields and mods to loot, Gearbox likes to sneak in a few dashes of joke sauce to its equipment soup. The bit this time? The shield doms you. You take damage or do anything, and the Cindershelly will let you know that you're subhuman scum. Here are a couple of sample lines, courtesy of our poor put-upon guides writer, Rory Norris, who had some things to say about it last month : \"Touch that barrel and scream for me\" \"Did you let go without asking first?\" \"Don't stop till I allow it\" \"Worship me\" \"Show me how close you can get, worm\" \"What an obedient worm you are\" As Rory explained, the shield was very chatty.

It's an angular set of speakers, with see through panels on the side to blast RGB light into your eyeballs. It feels very 2000s to me, in a way I haven't experienced with any of the speakers I've tested over the last few years. With a depth of connectivity options and that look, it already stood out, but $200 is a decent chunk of cash to spend, and we buy tech for more than just the look. And the answer to 'does it sound good?' ends up far more nuanced than I thought it would after my testing. The G2000 Pro's pretty iconic look is both a big positive and a negative. It's true that among your audiophile friends (assuming you have some), this will be one of the most 'out there' set of speakers. They have a radical angular design, plus a ring in the centre of the see-through plastic that is covered in RGB-lit lines. Powering the G2000 Pro on feels like an event in itself, bathing bright colourful lights into the room. It is truly striking. However, it can also be kind of annoying, as that colour is very bright and pulsing. Holding down the G button on the right-hand side turns o…",
