At the same time it renewed its pledge to double down on generative AI. In a document released today Ubisoft describes its \"radically new value-creation\" business model, which it claims will help it become \"a more gamer-centric organization\" thanks to a \"rightsized and more agile organization\". It goes on: \"The new operating model will further empower the execution of the Group's strategy, centered on Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences, supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.\" Ubisoft's embrace of generative AI is nothing new. Last year the company revealed Teammates, a \"playable generative AI research project\" featuring AI-powered NPCs capable of dynamically interacting with the player. Teammates was an evolution of an earlier experiment dubbed Neo NPCs , and it's easy to see how it could be implemented in future Ubisoft games, especially its sprawling open…",

But only as a professional graphics card with a hefty 32 GB of VRAM. Haroo. That 32 GB bit is the nightmare detail when it comes to PC gaming. Given the current RAMpocolypse , there's absolutely zero chance that a graphics card with 32 GB will be anything other than megabucks. B70 Pro soon. January 21, 2026 But first, let's cover what was actually said and by whom. X user Jaykihn, who has a strong record for accurate Intel leaks, posted, simply, \" B70 Pro soon. \" In the discussion that followed, Jaykihn confirmed with a clear \"yes\" when queried respectively whether the B70 Pro would be G31-based and have 32 GB of VRAM. So, there we have it. Intel's G31 Big Battlemage is coming soon and as a 32 GB Pro graphics card and not as the Intel Arc B770 gaming card we're all dying to see. That's according to this single, if usually reliable, source. Personally, I can believe it. Whether it's shipping manifests or driver references , there's just too much noise around the G31 G…",

WoW's latest pre-expansion patch introduces a sweeping set of reworked systems ahead of Midnight's launch in March. Those changes included an overhaul to the armor transmog system, which is generating a lot of angst from players who are finding themselves forced to pay thousands of gold for the privilege of wearing outfits they'd already paid for. While we were skeptical about the proposed transmog updates back in November, the new system does have some appeal: Previously, transmogrification applied item appearances of your choice to equipment directly. You could save and apply entire ensembles at once, but whenever you replaced one of your equipment pieces—or if you just wanted to change outfits—you'd need to reapply your desired transmog and pay the associated fee for each piece of gear. (Image credit: Blizzard) The new transmog system is meant to replace those frequent transmog costs. Rather than paying to apply appearances to your gear itself, you instead purchase outfit slots that you can save ensembles to. Saving a transmog setup to an outfit slot costs a fee, yo…",

Verbinski, who directed the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the American remake of The Ring, and animated Western comedy Rango, was pretty blunt in pinning the blame on Epic's Unreal Engine , which has been used more and more for visual effects in film and television in the past several years, including the Fallout TV series . \"I think the simplest answer is you've seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said in an interview with pop culture site But Why Tho? . \"I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards.\" Epic Games has now responded to Verbinski's statement. In an email sent to PC Gamer, Patrick Tubach, VFX supervisor at Epic Games, said: \"It’s inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI.

Thanks to a freshly announced release date, however, we now at least know when we'll see the full picture—and launch day is just two months away. In a Steam news post , Pearl Abyss has confirmed that Crimson Desert has gone gold: The game's primary development is, for all intents and purposes, complete and distribution-ready—aside from whatever tweaks might arrive in a day one patch. The announcement also brought us a release date: Crimson Desert will launch on March 19. That means we've got just over eight weeks before we get our full and proper introductions to protagonist Kliff and the fantasy world of Pavel, and see just how well Pearl Abyss has managed to cram so many kinds of gameplay into one Kliff-shaped package. Kliff can seemingly do so many things that our Harvey Randall wrote last April after a hands-on preview that Crimson Desert is a kind of \"action RPG tesseract\" that's barely conta…",

As the curtain fell, a small group of diehards expressed hope that it might somehow be brought back without a reliance on EA's servers—hope that was given, well, hope when former executive producer Mark Darrah said Anthem did actually have local server code \"right up until a few months before launch,\" and more importantly, \" the code is there to be salvaged and recovered .\" That's a far cry from actually making it happen, but some people do seem to at least be making progress in that direction. Youtuber And799 (via Kotaku ) has posted a video showing Anthem alive and kicking, and—big points here—with two players (actually two accounts) logged in simultaneously.

Fast-forward to my young adulthood and suddenly the Sega of old was no more, and watching games like Shenmue 2 release on Xbox felt oddly like betrayal. But that was nothing next to seeing Sonic appear on the Nintendo GameCube. What madness was this? Luckily I'd already swapped one console war for another, having been an early adopter of Xbox. I fell in love with Halo and would go head-over-heels for Halo 2, and lived for years with a magazine poster for Halo 3 behind my television with that magical promise: \"Finish the fight.\" I did do other things, I promise, but I spent an awful lot of time with the Master Chief, and Xbox and Halo became synonymous in my mind with peak console gaming.

I feel stodgy and static without them. The argument for vaulting them, as laid out by Epic's design director Ted Timmins , is that Fortnite had a \"combat fleeing issue\" that spoiled fights. \"If we are being honest with ourselves,\" he said, \"as much as we all love shockwaves, is it actually skilful to just throw one at your feet and immediately be able to escape an engagement?\" This echoes some but not all of the arguments made by streamer NickEh30 in December . He too said that shockwaves made escaping fights too easy—but added they also negate high-ground advantage, ruin early rotations, and outclass all other mobility items. Fans wondered whether NickEh30's prompted Epic's move, but Timmins denied that in his post. I and most users on the game's subreddit disagree with the decision to vault shockwaves—I'll explain why in a minute—but I do sympathize with both Timmins and NichEh30. Shockwaves can be a crutch.

In case you're unaware, WoW's been of a mind to fix its UI mod (addon) problem for a long time. Specifically, combat addons—the idea being, a player shouldn't have a raw competitive advantage because they had a bunch of third-party plugins installed. Blizzard announced its plans to cull combat addons last year, and that day has finally come. (Addons that don't impact combat are fine, although they do need updating.) I've hopped in and had some time to fiddle around with the changes on my Outlaw Rogue—both the lack of combat addons, the class changes made to facilitate that, and Blizzard's updated \"Cooldown Manager\" and Personal Resource display.

While it's much more subtle and nebulous than these changes, Bungie has also claimed it's \"doubling down on the dark, gritty, and grounded sci-fi world\" through an updated visual style, \"deepened environmental storytelling\", and the narrative-tracking Codex. This focus on narrative and world in an extraction shooter is rather hard to understand without seeing it in action. Nevertheless, when Bungie announced the voice cast for Marathon , with the likes of Samantha Béart, Roger Clark, Darin De Paul, Jennifer English, Neil Newbon, and Ben Starr, I was very taken aback.

As I discovered, a Thunderbolt 5 hub runs anywhere from expensive to 'good lord, they can't be serious, can they?' The Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma I'm looking at today is more the latter at $400 / £400 . But do cheaper Thunderbolt 5 hubs come with RGB lighting? They do not—at least most I've seen.

The original suit alleged the company had \"engaged in a systematic strategy\" of buying up competitors, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, in order to maintain its social media monopoly. The case was brought before a US district judge in Washington, who ultimately ruled last year that Meta had not violated antitrust laws with these acquisitions. In his decision, Judge James Boasberg even noted that the FTC itself had reviewed and approved both Meta's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, as well as the company's 2014 purchase of WhatsApp. Undeterred, the FTC is appealing that decision, and still highlights those same acquisitions as the motivation behind its most recent appeal .

According to Kurt Kuhlmann, Bethesda's former Elder Scrolls loremaster and the co-lead designer on Skyrim, \"the main problem with Starfield is it didn't fully cohere as a game\". Kuhlmann left Bethesda in 2023, around the time of Starfield's launch, so he was there throughout development and thus was present for a lot of changes in regards to how Bethesda worked and how staff communicated. When he was working on Skyrim, itself a massive endeavour, things were simpler. \"I was working directly on the game, and I was a lead,\" he says. \"That was how all the leads worked then, and so I was directly working with all the people, all the quest designers, myself.\" But from Skyrim on, that started to change, and it was \"one of the main things\" that Kuhlmann \"didn't like\".

The managing director of Kioxia's memory business unit, Shunsuke Nakato, made the admission during an interview with Korean news outlet Digital Daily , elaborating that the ever-hungry AI industry's demand for memory has led to a challenging supply and demand situation. Nakato went on to say that, as many companies are continuing to invest in AI out of a fear of being left behind, the situation is likely to continue into 2027 at least. Though memory supplies are limited, Kioxia is apparently deploying something of a 'gentleman's agreement' with its clients, remaining committed to existing contracts rather than adopting a 'first-come, first-served' or 'everything to the highest bidder' approach. However, Nakato also admits that even long-term Kioxia customers are having to contend with as much as a 30% year-on-year price increase. Also interesting to note from this interview is Nakato's scepticism about QLC tech. For…",

The biggest one for me is its rather linear progression based around moving through the zones to find new ores, from copper and iron to cobalt , adamantite , and mithril. I'd forgive you for believing that your end goal right now is finding mithril ore, but that's not the case. Mithril's not actually available yet, despite it being required for several recipes listed in-game. The good news is that, when it's eventually added, it won't just be another block to break—presumably in the unreleased fifth zone. Hypixel's founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme, says , \"We got some fun ideas about Mithril… let’s say it won't be as simple to mine as the others\". As for what these ideas are, exactly, that of course remains to be seen, and it's added to an already long list of to-dos the team already has to tackle— Collins-Laflamme only bought back the project two months ago and whipped up the early access build in record time, after all. Nevertheless, changes and new features are coming out at a breakneck pace right now, such as adding the ability to hide armour …",

It's not the biggest addition in PowerToys 0.97 , but Cursor Wrap might just be mana from heaven for some PC enthusiasts. As the name suggests, activating this tool essentially links the edges of multiple displays together, so as you pop off the edge of one monitor, the mouse cursor should seamlessly appear on the opposing edge of the next display. I know Windows already does this when you have, say, two monitors, but when you have something like two rows of three displays, stacked on top of each other, it actually does a poor job of moving the cursor around. This is especially true if you have the desktop expanded across the whole caboodle. With Cursor Wrap, that's no longer an issue, and you'll find that your mouse can now zip vertically through displays with ease. It does the same thing even if you only have one screen, linking the opposing edges into a uni…",

Now a new report claims it's set to be released by the end of March. According to Digitimes (via Tomshardware ), \"Windows on Arm (WoA) platform notebooks using the N1X will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\" The report claims that after the launch of an initial variant of N1X in Q1 2026, three more versions of the chip will be released in Q2. What's more, Digitimes further says that Nvidia has a follow up, codenamed N2, lined up for release in the third quarter. If all this is true it's both exciting and somewhat peculiar. After all, we've just had the CES 2026 show , which surely would have been the perfect opportunity to get the maximum number of eyeballs on what Nvidia presumably plans to be a game changing chip for the PC industry. To pass that opportunity up only to launch a month or two later? That's a bit odd. Of course, the tech industry is currently in flux thanks to the ongoing RAMpocolypse . So that could be a factor.

The cosmic entity in question? Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which has confounded executive suits and game developers alike by raking in enormous success despite being built by a core team of 30 people (and a large list of contractors) . At the very least, Chmielarz is talking from a place of comparison with Witchfire's similarly-sized team of just under 30 devs—he's cognisant of the above quibble, stating later in the interview \"we use outsourcing, and Sandfall Interactive used a lot of outsourcing\".

So, why is this worth getting excited about? For a start, we've not really heard a peep about the tech in a long old time, and this high-profile deal pushes it back into the spotlight. For another, ReRAM will apparently give traditional flash memory a run for its money as Weebit describes it as a \"low-power, cost-effective NVM that has proven excellent retention at high temperatures.\" To elaborate, ReRAM is non-volatile, so it's more like NAND in that it can retain data aft…",

This is a Remedy game, after all. I don't remember a huge amount about its combat except that there's a lot of dashing, a lot of offensive levitating, and somehow office furniture is always involved. What I do remember well is the setting: Control is an action game, but it's also a very arch horror game set in the austere pebblecrete hallways of a brutalist tower called The Oldest House. Control's story and setting is often compared to the fictional SCP Foundation, which is basically hyper-conspiratorial crowdsourced weird fiction that has also inspired stuff like Lethal Company . I don't know how much more I can say to sell Control to you, and it's probably a waste of time anyway because money talks: Control is $4 on Steam at the moment.

But after that, he says it's on employers and job seekers to, more or less, just start using AI. \"The demand side of this is a little bit like, every firm has to start by using it,\" said Nadella, throwing in some industry-standard hyperbole by calling AI a \"cognitive amplifier\" that gives you \"access to infinite minds.\" The…",

So dust off that gamepad and embrace the inherent fun of jumping over stuff with me. It's a genre largely unbeleaguered by big-budget bloat, intent on retaining the purity of old-school action at its best. Platformers remain fascinated with the ability of the videogame to sate a primordial human urge: to run, be free, and soar weightlessly over certain doom. From cerebral puzzle platformers, to parkour simulations, to cotton candy collectathons, the genre is as diverse and worth celebrating as it’s ever been.

Some examples of the former include Team Fortress 2, which has 520 achievements, and Payday 2, which has a frankly ridiculous 1328. It's not a phenomenon exclusive to competitive shooters either: the cult traditional roguelike Tales of Maj'Eyal has 1782 achievements.

But the Fez-like era never really happened and I've been left to wonder what it might be like to play something even half as clever. Cassette Boy is the closest I've ever got to playing a game that might actually rival Fez. While it lacks Tetris blocks and made-up languages, it's full of similarly mysterious characters and puzzles to uncover as you spin every level around in search of answers. The moon is gone and you, a small boy made of white cubes, are on a mission to find it. Cassette Boy begins as a legally distinct Zelda clone—you pull a sword out of a stone in the first five minutes—and transforms into something else the moment you have the power to turn the world around as many times as you'd like. Just like in Fez, the ability to peek behind solid objects, like houses and trees, in what you thought was a 2D world is an arcane power that only the strangest characters you meet seem to acknowledge.

Players have been clambering for server transfers for a while now: for some it's because the world they started playing on no longer has enough players and feels like a ghost town, or because one particular faction is dominating the Landsraad, or because their friends have moved onto other games and they're looking for some new blood.

You can easily spot azure forests on your map, so zoom in to check if there's any water before trekking over. Search the bodies of water and you should find azure kelp, a bright blue plant that shimmers and often pokes out of the water. Since it's a plant, press F to harvest it.
