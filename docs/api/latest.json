When the pandemic initially sent entire corporate industries home, there was a flurry of experimentation in using games not just as hangout spaces, but online meeting rooms too. Some people even had meetings in Red Dead Online. That energy for makeshift avatar office culture didn't really last, and I've felt a lingering loneliness in working from home even though I prefer it to a commute. Trends like body-doubling haven't caught my interest, but what has grabbed me by the throat and not let go is an adorable \"cozy multiplayer productivity game\" called On-Together that's made my work week 100% more social and more productive. Imagine turning Animal Crossing into a coworking space—that's basically On-Together. It's unabashedly cozy game-core with chibi avatars, a pastel color palette, and little minigames like fishing and basketball.

Yet, here we are. The film, as reported by Deadline , is being developed by Anton, the production group behind the 2020 film Greenland , and writers Cory Todd Hughes and Adrian Speckert. Hughes and Speckert don't have any screenplays about being chained together a la Chained Together on their resumes yet, but they have worked on another videogame adaptation: the upcoming Finding Frankie film, the source material for which looks to be one of those not-quite-Five Nights at Freddy's-type games littered about Steam. It's an odd choice for an adaptation. Chained Together doesn't strike me as a narratively inclined game, but then again, neither do Minecraft , Outrun , or Rampage .

In 2024, the platform averaged over 80 million players a day, approximately 40% of whom are under 13 years of age. The news was announced by the company's chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman, who claimed in a press briefing that the technology is \"pretty accurate\" and can estimate the age of users between five and 25, apparently with an accuracy \"within one to two years.\" Roblox says it is establishing what it believes will become \"a new industry standard\", and one of the key elements is limiting communications between child and adult users. The feature is now live, though voluntary, with the requirement for either \"Facial Age Estimation\" or ID verification becoming mandatory worldwide from December 2025 to January 2026. Users who do not wish to use chat features do not have to complete an age check. \"Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become Trusted Connections with people they know,\" says the Roblox announcement .

Keighley, host of The Game Awards, posted a message on X urging his followers to \"Check out #TheGameAwards nominee page on Steam to celebrate the best of the year.\" He attached an image of the Steam front page, which—because he was logged in at the time—revealed that he has precisely one game in his wishlist.

Liz Albl joined CD Projekt last month in the role of senior writer on Cyberpunk 2 . Prior to this, she spent almost three years as narrative lead at Cloud Chamber Games working on BioShock 4, with her other credits including Ghost of Tsushima , Watch Dogs: Legion , and just over a year working on Monolith's cancelled Wonder Woman game . As spotted by IGN , Albl left Cloud Chamber in August—around the time the developer laid off staff after BioShock 4 failed an internal review , with its narrative criticised by 2K's executives in particular as the publisher committed to a development overhaul. BioShock 4 had already been in development for a decade before the review, with 2K announcing it was in production six years ago.

Simply put, I like the way the Stitcher, Ferro, and Anvil feel compared to competition like the Kettle, Arpeggio, and Torrente, among others. And that's lucky for me now that I've seen the maths behind it all. Content creator ' Min Max Lab ', who's been doing a bunch of excellent Arc Raiders science experiments lately, has worked out the efficiency of the most common and popular weapons by weighing up their max durability, how much is lost per shot, and how expensive each one is to repair. As cliché as it sounds, the results will surprise you. Firstly, my beloved Stitcher is the most efficient of the bunch, wringing out 13,700 damage/1950 shots per full repair at level 4, which works out to just two credits per shot.

Dailian quotes a Samsung report claiming, \"the 2nm first-generation gate-all-around (GAA) process has improved performance by 5%, power efficiency by 8%, and area by 5% compared to the 3nm second-generation process.\" At first glance, those are not exactly mind blowing advances. For context, it's worth noting that comparing nodes between companies is awfully tricky. Superficially, you might expect Samsung's new 2 nm node, also known as SF2, to be broadly comparable to TSMC's upcoming N2 technology, which has yet to be seen in a chip you can actually buy but is also ostensibly a 2 nm-class node. On paper, you'd also throw Intel's 18A node into the same category. Again, Intel's 18A isn't out yet but is due any day now. In practice, it's way more complicated than that. For instance, the very notion of the implied scale of \"2 nm\" is now quite disconnected from actual feature size inside modern chips.

It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side.

Although it follows the same process of meeting new characters who need your help, completing their quests to unlock them as friends, and clearing up any chaos caused by some force linked to your trauma, Wishblossom Ranch is unlike any of the expansions Disney Dreamlight Valley has released. Each biome you explore is so different from one another, yet the quests that link them and the relationships between the characters you meet pulls them together in an incredibly neat package.

Offering the Android app version alongside your Steam games may be an interesting step in the right direction. Eagle eyed X user Brad Lynch spotted what may be \"the first 'official' Android app on Steam\" while poring over the changelist of, drum roll please… Walkabout Mini Golf . Apparently changelist entry #32325165 adds the game's Android .apk to the App Config, plus OpenXR support . Lynch claims the Android version will be available as an alternate branch of the Steam game's app ID, hence the two-for-one, no need for a separate purchase theory. He also theorises, \"If you own this game on Steam already, you will have access to the Android version on Steam Frame day one.\" This would be a very good thing for the upcoming Steam Frame .

For $269 ( direct from Thermal Grizzly ), you can have one as well, though let's be honest here: the Der8enchtable is going to be of zero use to the vast majority of PC enthusiasts. That's because it's simply an open-platform circuit board that you can connect a motherboard to, and separately control fans, pumps, and lights; it also provides external storage options so you don't have to use those on the motherboard. It might be a bit 'inside baseball' but let me explain why this is so useful for hardware testing.

The headline enhancement is more fully leveraging machine learning for upscaling, which is why, as we understand it and as the new AMD teaser trailer implies, Redstone will be tied to AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT . Only the latest AMD graphics architecture has sufficient hardware matrix math ability to run the AI code. Or so the story likely goes, anyway. Slightly confusingly, AMD has also said that Redstone can run on Nvidia GPUs on account of being developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology can therefore be \"converted\" into compute shader code.…",

A grimdark first-person slasher with strong Dark Messiah: Might and Magic vibes in Unreal Engine 5? There are few games I'd wishlist faster. But Paraglacial's glossy action-RPG shot even further up my most wanted list with its latest trailer, revealing that you'll be accompanied on your adventures by a bedraggled talking rat. Said rodent sits on your shoulder and speaks gnomically in a voice that sounds like someone unrolling an ancient, cursed papyrus scroll, and I already love him and want him to be my very best friend. The rat appears right at the start of the trailer, seemingly complaining to the player character about having narrowly escaped an ambush. There's a bit of rhetorical back-and-forth between the two, before the player commands the rat to return to the safety of his knapsack, as the pair move on in search of their destination—the Moon Gate. The rest of the trailer shows off a mixture of combat and exploration. Fighting certainly appears to have Dark Messiah-ish bones, letting you kick enemies off ledges and impale them upon conveniently placed spike-traps. But the…",

Yes, I had to look it up. In the case of the former, this rare earth element is vital for a number of engineering processes, including semiconductor manufacturing—and as a result of an export-related supply shortage, prices have risen from $8 per kilogram at the end of last year to $126 per kg in 2025 (via Bloomberg ). While US president Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping late last month resulted in a pause on some of its rare earth restrictions, earlier global controls outlined in April of this year are still in place. These restrictions require companies to obtain licenses from Beijing before exporting rare earth materials out of the country, and the approvals granted to date are said to be for small shipments only . That's a serious issue for the global manufacturing supply chain, as China is estimated to control roughly 69% of rare earth mining , and refines nearly all of the yttrium currently available.

For the uninitiated, transmog (sometimes called glamour in other MMOs) is a system that allows players to slap a new appearance over their current gear. In WoW, you used to go to a transmog NPC, create an outfit, and pay a gold fee to throw on your fit. This would essentially overwrite the appearances of those items with the ones you transmogged them to. In Midnight, that's all changing. You can see a handy summary by WoWHead here , but in essence, WoW's moving from this overwritten appearance system to an \"outfit\" system. And, while I'm about to do a whole bunch of grumbling, there are some major benefits to what Blizzard's put together. Essentially, the system—currently on the Midnight Beta—allows you to make outfits that can, at the drop of a hat (and chestpiece, and trousers, and boots), be thrown over your existing gear without having to bleed gold every time you get a new purple.

(Image credit: Furcula) It's not the basic premise that's so confusing, though it is odd: you play a mouse living in the sewers, who must battle his way up through the corrupt society above. The clearest inspiration is The Binding of Isaac, with winding dungeon levels, top-down shooting, and a cute-but-gross art style. The biggest twist is the morsels themselves. Each run you choose a card that allows you to transform into one—a kind of ugly little monster with its own unique attack style and special ability. New cards can be found over the course of the run, and you can hold up to three at a time, so you can shift between forms. But with that framework established, Morsels immediately throws you in at the deep end. Its world is utterly chaotic and full of unexplained phenomena, and it quickly starts to feel like an exam you forgot to study for. (Image credit: …",
