The technology came out when I was still in school and today I'm at an age where buying a motor vehicle could be described as a midlife crisis. No, PhysX hasn't been relevant for a while. Or so I thought… Earlier this year, Nvidia pulled support for 32-bit CUDA applications with its newest generation graphics cards, the RTX 50 series. With it gone, it's no longer possible to natively run 32-bit games with hardware-accelerated PhysX effects. Why that matters: PhysX offers a way to run some in-game physics calculations on an add-in card . That not only frees up the CPU to focus on other things, it also allows developers to put a lot more physics-based effects into their games. As such, games with PhysX effects tend to have a lot of stuff going on. If you run a game with PhysX enabled but without the hardware to accelerate it then all of the physics calculations fall on your CPU. Even on today's much faster processors, with many more cores than those around during PhysX's peak, the impact of these added effects severely limits frame rate. The CPU becomes a bottleneck. Or you turn PhysX off. Now, I'll admit, I hadn't thought about Ph…",

      "body": "One of the biggest mysteries in Arc Raiders , even preceding its full release, has been how matchmaking works. During the beta, there was talk of a gear-based matchmaking system that had some players convinced it stuck around. But now the community has decided that Arc Raiders has a different kind of matchmaking. I've dubbed it 'aggression-based matchmaking', and it's the phenomenon that players have noticed for quite some time now, where those who don't engage in PvP get put in chill lobbies, whereas players who shoot on sight get placed in super aggressive lobbies. (Image credit: Embark) I first noticed this a few weeks ago. For the most part, I had been very chill in solo lobbies, just going in to loot or even team up with strangers to take down bigger arcs. It was a great experience, and the sense of camaraderie here was unmatched. But then, on one fateful day, I decided to shoot someone in a solo lobby. I ended up killing them, and my fate was sealed. From here on out, everything changed. I'd get shot in the back of the head before I even clocked another raider. Gone were my team-ups of old—I couldn't even talk to anyone, as the whole lobby was just shoot on sight. Now, my ex…",

It's Divinity —just Divinity—and I'd bet several dollars it's a soft reboot for a series which is going to pull in exponentially more players after the mondo success of Baldur's Gate 3. So if we can't argue about what that statue is or what Larian's next game will be anymore, what's left to us? Fear not: we've already started arguing about whether Divinity will be a turn-based game when it eventually arrives, or if it'll revive the old, hallowed ways of realtime with pause, like its Infinity Engine forefathers of olde. In fact, the debate went on before Divinity was even officially revealed at The Game Awards. \"There are rumors that Larian's next game 'Divinity' is NOT turn-based…\" tweeted content creator SynthPotato .

You heard it here first: AMD $AMD is planning to use Intel $INTC foundry to manufacture chips in the USA (not just packaging). During my job listing research, I uncovered a job listing posted by AMD that mentions Intel’s “PowerVia” under preferred experience… This is HUGE! pic.twitter.com/BSZgjadWDO December 12, 2025 For sure, the Intel connection is clear enough. \"PowerVia\" is Intel's branding for what's known more generically in the chip-making industry as backside power . In the simplest terms, it's a new technology that involves moving the power delivery networks in chips below the transistors. It's claimed to result in faster and more efficient chips. What's more, PowerVia is being introduced on Intel's upcoming Intel 18A node . Put all that together with Intel's stated desire to make chips for all comers on its new process nodes, the fact that \"taping out\"…",

Our greed knows no limit; it even surprised the devs. Speaking to our brand director, Tim Clark, and strategic director, Evan Lahti, Robert Sammelin, who is art director at Arc Raiders, revealed how the wall exploits were one of the more surprising community activities they witnessed players commit.

TerraUSD was a so-called stablecoin for its intrinsic tie to the value of the US dollar. Intended to always be valued at $1 per coin, the foundations of the stablecoin were complex and shaky. It relied on protocols, a separate counter-token called Luna, and an exchange for burning/minting tokens to maintain the price of TerraUSD at $1. Failed attempts to prop up the system and mislead investors using secret funds eventually led to the collapse of both TerraUSD and Luna, from $1 and $87 on May 5, to $0.2 and $0.00005 on May 13 . \"In fact, core Terraform products did not work as Kwon advertised and were manipulated to create the illusion of a functioning and decentralized financial syste…",

Lastly, you can abandon battles, rather than simply waiting to die if you messed up. I cannot understate how hyped I am for that lumina loadout detail.

Either way, these fans have been sadly watching the final days of December slowly tick away, one by one, with no sign of a Half-Life 3/X announcement—which means they've pinned pretty much all their hopes on the announcement coming at The Game Awards.

The trailer features VO from (presumably) some manner of fucko alien complaining about how namby pamby, politically correct, Empire-era emissions and engine size standards ruined speeder racing. But now with the antiwoke New Republic and its gutting of the relevant regulatory bodies, we're returning to \"massive engine, lightning fast, lives on the line\" speeder races. Speeder racing's inevitable reckoning with driver mortality aside, the racing in question looks sick as hell, with a real sense of speed and great use of scenic Star Wars vistas throughout the trailer. I mean, your graphics are certainly pretty enough: Get the handling right, and bing bang boom, that's a Star Wars racing game I'd play. What will really seal the deal for me is some kind of campaign or otherwise toothsome singleplayer structure, which remains an open question at the moment.

Conversations spanning multiple languages, yet everyone seems to understand each other? Teams of three, not unlike a certain King of Fighters? Turns out my vibes were not misplaced, if chatting with game director Federico Cardini is anything to go by. Milestone's \"love of Japanese animation and fighting games\" did a lot of heavy lifting in influencing Screamer's story and overall tone. \"I am personally a Street Fighter player,\" Cardini tells me. \"Our creative director, Michele [Caletti], is a super fan of King of Fighters.

The new Screamer—set to launch next year—has a very different vibe to its '90s predecessors. Peeled away from more realistic pastures for a neon-lit anime bonanza, heavily-modded cars and the unusual decision to put narrative at the centre of its arcade racing. On paper, it looks wildly unlike the games that came before it. But as Game Director Federico Cardini tells me, Milestone hasn't forgotten its roots. I asked about some of the more negative reaction to the revival, namely from people who played the originals and weren't happy with the new direction. \"I completely understand their opinion,\" Cardini said. \"It's something we ourselves struggled with at the very beginning.

If all you know about Warframe is that it's a game with space ninjas, the relentless Wagnerian intensity of a Herzog monologue might feel like a strange fit. But Warframe is beautifully, uncannily strange. As Herzog says during the magnificent work of advertising, Warframe is a story about beings \"cursed to walk this senseless universe in living metal, haunted by dreams.\" Warframes are an open question about identity, humanity, and utility. They are a riddle cast in razor iron and warped, quivering meat. They are weapons 3D printed from muscle memory, psychic imprint, and arcane force. They can get pregnant.

I spoke to Neon Giant heads Arcade Berg and Tor Frick again last week, and can add a little more context to the trailer. The gameplay we see in the video reminds me of Bulletstorm—big kicks, exploding heads, lots of shooting—but we also spy some sneaky assassinations, so it isn't entirely about blowing stuff up. The studio is calling No Law a \"first-person open world shooter RPG.\" \"You have experience points and skill trees, and you opt into how you want to play the game,\" said Berg. \"Do you want to be more into lockpicking, or do you want to be a hacker, or do you want to be a specialist with certain types of weapons … We never tell you which route to take, we say that the player can…",

Forest 3's trailer begins with a first person view of a starship cockpit before something goes horribly awry and we careen impossibly far away from Earth at breakneck speeds. With the help of a cheeky little shoulder arm, our protagonist proceeds to do survival game stuff: Hunting, gathering, but no tree punching, which is a welcome relief. The sci-fi vibe really has me intrigued: The planet's swampy and foreboding, with that grey-blue, clammy, soaked-through on a rainy day look of Death Stranding. Before things fade to black, we get the disturbing sight of some kind of zombified half-torso thing emerging from the water. \"Do I have to have played Forest 1 and Forest 2 to get Forest 3?\" I quipped to the PC Gamer work chat.

Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis promises a \"stunning re-imagining\" of Lara Croft's first adventure from nearly 30 years ago, with updates graphics and gameplay, and \"new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.\" Narratively at least, the remake seems to be treated as sort of a recollection of years past, which presumably opens the door to previously unseen events and action. The announcement also finally gives us our first live look at the \"Unified Lara\" character design revealed in early 2024, a blend of the OG and her more modern look, last seen in 2018. This will be the second remake of the original Tomb Raider, following the serviceable but largely unremarkable Tomb Raider: Anniversary . But that was 18 years ago, and I'd say that's more than enough time passed to allow for a new shot at it. The bigger deal, though, is Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Set in northern India, Catalyst follows Lara on an all-new adventure that takes place in the aftermath of a \"…",

Perhaps appropriate, then, that it's not called Control 2—it's Control Resonant—though it does seem to follow on from the events of the first game. Dylan, seemingly now free of the influence of the Hiss, has been deployed by the FBC to combat a new supernatural disaster—namely, reality-warping forces that have spilled out of the Oldest House and into the outside world, twisting an entire city into new forms.

The trailer showcased large, angry, heavily bespectacled bad guy Victor Gideon, apparently a once-respected doctor who sure seems to be having a rough time of things more recently. The big twist, though, is the appearance of Leon as a playable character: Until now, Capcom has insisted that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, but it seems that Leon will be playing a significant role as well. But not the same kind of role as Grace: She will center on Resident Evil: Requiem's survival horror gameplay, while Leon will be all about the \"explosive action.\" And hoo boy does it look good: The trailer showed a brief snippet of over the shoulder shooting, as well as some of Leon's signature melee combos: That roundhouse kick fired off deeply buried synapses in my brain.

And the idea of playing a Faust-like character who gets their magical abilities from a pact with a supernatural entity is an intriguing one. \"Warlocks, they make a dangerous pact with a powerful being, and really what it is is they have insanely high charisma.

Alright, that… still sounds pretty Mass Effect. But Mass Effect didn't have a spectral space cowboy voiced by Matthew McConaughey haunting its protagonist, did it? No! If anything that's closer to Cyberpunk's deal! But nobody in Cyberpunk can do space magic like Exodus protagonist Jun Aslan, so we're in the clear on that front.

Rockstar denied allegations that it fired the employees because they were attempting to form a union at the studio, saying initially that they were let go for \"gross misconduct,\" which it later elaborated to mean they had been \" distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.\" That denial didn't hold water with the fired employees and the Independent Workers' of Great Britain (IWGB) union, which filed legal action against Rockstar in November. November also saw the matter brought up in UK Parliament , as Edinburgh West MP Christine Jardine asked for a meeting with the relevant government minister \"to discuss what steps could be taken to support the workforce?\" The pressure on Rockstar went up significantly yesterday when the matter was raised in Parliament again, this time during Prime Minister's Questions, le…",

Unfortunately, PC hunters will once again have to wait to see the full extent of the performance fixes Capcom has been promising since July . While Capcom says the Title Update 4 launch will implement multi-platform optimization improvements, additional performance fixes specific to the PC version won't arrive until January in a follow-up patch.

Well, Nick Valentine's my favourite anyway. PCG's Ted Litchfield interviewed Bethesda's design director Emil Pagliarulo who, with Thief's Garrett as the launching point, went into detail on the early stages of Fallout 4, when the game was set in New York (it would end up being set in Boston). \"Stephen Russell was the first actor I ever wrote dialog for back in Thief,\" says Pagliarulo, referencing synth gumshoe Nick Valentine's voice actor. \"He was a character that I created.

Kravitz's role in the game was presumably meant to be revealed at tonight's Game Awards, but slipped out early in a now-deleted message posted to the official 007 X account— whoops : \"He rose from nothing, broke free, and built his own Kingdom of Aleph. Introducing Bawma, the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere who's as charismatic as he is unpredictable.\" \"I am sometimes asked: 'Bawma, how is it that you hear every whisper in every corner?'\" Kravtiz croons in Bawma's big reveal, which has also been taken down but remains available for viewing on other, unofficial sites. \"And I answer, 'I have built Aleph with my will, my blood, my whole self. This city is an extension of my being—my body. But today it became infected'.\" Lenny's cure, it seems, is to lower the source of the infection into a pit…",

The whole point of the mode, Blizzard says, is wild, frenetic fun: getting super powerful and collecting every transmog armor appearance, pet, mount, and toy an expansion offers in a short period of time. But the decisions the company makes about the mode, including the most recent update, are often not in support of that goal. Players level up their strength so fast and so far in Remix that they're ridiculously overpowered, tackling even the toughest group content in the game solo, romping through old dungeons and raids as if they were new-player zones. In the current Legion Remix, players are called Timerunners, and the same buff they build up to become OP levelers and fighters also gives them a speed buff—they literally dash everywhere they go. So far, so good. Go fast! But not that fast (Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) But even when the first Mists of Pandaria Remix debuted last year, there were signs of trouble on the horizon.

The upcoming Steam Machine is the most pertinent recent example of this, but, to crank up the enigmatic dial, every bespoke mini PC has its secrets. Case in point, the Zotac Magnus EN mini workstation with RTX 5060 Ti, which seems to power that GPU via the PCIe connector, and not in the same way as Asus BTF cards and motherboards. The mini PC was disassembled and inspected by HKEPC , then brought to my attention by Unikoshardware and Wccftech . Apart from how impressive it is to be able to fit a discrete desktop RTX 5060 Ti into such a small chassis at all, one thing that sticks out is the complete lack of a power cable for the GPU. Looking at GPU-Z shows something interesting: \"Bus interface: PCIe x8 5.0 @ x8 5.0.\" Normally, for an RTX 5060 Ti, it would just show x 5.0. While I'm not sure what the \"@\" is all about, that's basically hinting that the x16 PCIe fingers are split into two batches of x8. And upon closer inspection of the graphics card, it is in fact split in two. As Uniko and Wccf point out, the split-off part gets fed a 19 V input, as they're not being used for…",

The Ayaneo Pocket Play is a smartphone with a sliding display that can be pushed up to reveal a d-pad, AXBY face buttons, and two virtual joystick touchpads. Ayaneo had previously teased this gaming-geared phone early last month . Now, there's a fresh blog post in Ayaneo's typically effusive style about the Pocket Play, plus a Kickstarter page . However, tech specs remain thin on the ground. We don't yet know what processor this bad boy will end up boasting, or even the device's display dimensions. However, given that Ayaneo is known for Android-based gaming handhelds such as the Snapdragon-based Ayaneo Pocket S , perhaps I won't need all three guesses to figure out this phone's headlining hardware specs. So, like most of its ilk, it will likely be an Android device. That means we won't be able to play our precious PC games on it without an emulator, such as Winlator, which is a bit of a job to set up. At least other forms of Android emulation are generally excellent these days. Though there's no gesture at a release window beyond the words 'coming soon,' I'm already intrigued.

Patch 1.6.0 targets four specific issues: Removing the zipline on Stella Montis that lets players go out of bounds. Fixing a collision that let players get through a wall in Blue Gate. Fixing material issues, which meant bullets or arcs' vision weren't blocked by some objects. Patching a gap at the Spaceport Launch Tower, which allowed players to get shot through a wall. I've had a couple of problems here and there with arc's vision or bullets not properly being blocked, although I chalked up my issues to the character movement latency that plagued my games at launch.
