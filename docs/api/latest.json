      "body": "يدخل منتخب بنين عام 2026 بطموحات كبيرة في كأس أمم أفريقيا، حيث يستعد لمواجهة مصر في دور الـ 16 يوم الاثنين المقبل (5 يناير)، مدعوما بحافز مالي استثنائي. وأعلن رئيس الاتحاد البنيني لكرة القدم ماتيوران دي شاكوس عن مكافأة قدرها 200 مليون فرنك أفريقي (نحو 300 ألف يورو) ستمنح للاعبين في حال التأهل إلى ربع النهائي. ووصف شاكوس ذلك بأنه رسالة قوية لتعزيز معنويات الفريق في سعيه نحو المجد القاري. وكان عام 2025 متذبذبا للمنتخب البنيني الذي خاض فيه 10 مباريات رسمية، حقق فيها 3 انتصارات فقط، مقابل تعادل واحد و6 هزائم. وسجل \"الفهود\" خلال هذه المباريات 10 أهداف وتلقت شباكهم 15 هدفا. ويحتل منتخب بنين المركز 92 عالميا في تصنيف الاتحاد الدولي (فيفا). رغم ذلك، يمثل دور الـ 16 في كأس الأمم فرصة نادرة للمنتخب البنيني لتحقيق إنجاز تاريخي جديد. وستكون مواجهة الفراعنة اختبارا حقيقيا لبنين أمام المنتخب الأكثر تتويجا بالبطولة القارية. ويحلم المنتخب البنيني بتكرار ما فعله بمنتخب المغرب في الدور نفسه من البطولة القارية على أرض مصر عام 2019، حين عبر لربع النهائي بركلات الترجيح 4-1، بعد التعادل مع أسود الأطلس 1-1.",

The update is detailed in a Steam community blog post , which reasons \"This will most probably be the final large update for BIY.\" It seems to be primarily targeted at modders, but contains five new words for use in custom levels: become, facedby, hold, happy, and angry. If you've never played Baba is You, words change the way a given level works as you construct condition-altering sentences. For instance, Baba is Happy would theoretically make the player character happy… what effect that would have on a puzzle, I'm not sure. There's also a bunch of new sprites, including a fox, a bean, a hot dog, a cactus, and so on.

We've outgrown all that these days. In the place of arbitrary and distant gods we have arbitrary and distant algorithms: vast lattices of code that no one really understands, whose purpose seems to be to make the entire world more insane and more racist. (Image credit: Bay 12) Their workings are indefinable, their intentions obscure, and they probably determine a vast amount of what you watch, read, and listen to. I know they do for me. Apple News feeds me news, my YouTube home feed suggests videos, Spotify introduces me to the latest and greatest music generated by data centres the size of Idaho. I don't have to think about anything at all; it just comes to me. It's kind of awful, really—a vast abdication of responsibility on my part. Well, no more.

If you want to build a city in a world filled with vengeful gods, in deep space on the back of a cosmic whale, or on a massive steampunk train thundering through a post-apocalyptic landscape, you'll be able to.

Though these Luna versions have seen us step into Snezhnaya for the first time, we haven't technically hit the 6.0 update yet, which kind of makes sense when you consider Nod-Krai is its own autonomous region. For those who are new to Genshin livestreams, miHoYo puts on a special programme every six weeks breaking down all of the new content coming in the subsequent update, including characters, quests, bosses, and new areas. As a little bonus for tuning in, you can grab three livestream codes to redeem for some extra Primogems. This time around, character-wise, we can expect Hydro five-star Columbina, Geo five-star Zibai, and Geo four-star Illuga. There will also apparently be reruns for Neuvillette and Ineffa, though this isn't certain until the stream. Since livestream codes usually expire with a day or so, make sure to grab them if you want them. Either way, I'll add the codes below as they drop during the stream.

We'll be able to switch between a \"Play Mode\" that is \"designed to streamline gameplay and make the playing experience less cluttered and confusing\" and an \"Edit Mode\" for \"creators and power users who want expansive control over their creative process.\" So far, so good. It's also hard to quibble with promises to improve the performance, graphics, online stability, and VR support. Some players aren't so impressed by the promise to implement a Creator Marketplace for user-generated content, which is to say: paid mods. While you can buy DLC to play games like Zombicide in Tabletop Simulator, the Steam Workshop is where the real action is.

Every update has adorned the in-progress build with wild new zones and features, from cutting-edge rat AI to player-morphing monster juice . This time around, New Blood is promising the game's biggest explorable area yet, which means it's a great time to try all those spooky new toys. The Hightown Update comes after a short delay, but dropped just in time for a New Year's Day celebration. The release trailer shows off some of the new areas and a new weapon: a revolver with a rifle stock and a scope slapped on. A teaser blog post on Steam said the new patch contains both \"largest, most vertical open area\" and \"the most sophisticated, lethal and complex enemy force\" yet seen in Gloomwood, and shows off more of the new areas, which look suitably gothic and dismal. Back when the patch was delayed around Christmas, developer Dillon Rogers said on X that the new revolver-rifle would help players \"tackle those pesky constable snipers.\" My experience with Gloomwood is limited, but I do love a stealth game with winding, open s…",

A highlight of the series is the arresting performance from lead actor Rhea Seehorn, who plays one of the only normal humans left after most of the world suddenly merges into an eerily polite gestalt consciousness. Seehorn is best known for starring alongside Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul, but her work stretches back into the '90s. As it turns out, one of her earliest live action roles was in, of all things, a Magic: The Gathering game by Microprose. It is as hilarious, blurry, and gloriously low-budget as you'd hope. All the hallmarks of cheesy '90s PC game fantasy are on proud display here, with the actors superimposed over primitive CG backgrounds. The full tutorial appears to contain well over an hour of dictated instruction and probably isn't the best way to learn a notoriously complex card game (especially since this is nearly 30 years old), but it's admirably committed to the bit. Any video of the tutorial is now festooned with comments mentioning Seehorn's character in Pluribus, jokingly factoring the role into the show's canon. You might know…",

And, as real hardware sickos, many a shiny bobbin has received a thorough humbling at our hands. Yes, we love RGB lighting as much as the next person, but it'll take far more than a sparkly light show to impress us. All of that said, a whopping 34 bits of kit earned a review score of either 90% or higher— that's 4 more than last year . But what was simply the best? It's interesting to note that only one bit of hardware among the highest-rated six costs less than $100. Spoiler alert, it's the Arctic Freezer 36 , going for a seriously impressive price tag that rests comfortably under $50. Still though, it's hard to ignore just how expensive PC gaming continues to be. With the memory pricing apocalypse upon us, not to mention how it's set to carry on into 2026 and beyond , a bit of kit's value proposition is never far from our minds.

Looking back on a year of hardware reviews, plenty of premium bits of kit didn't impress me much—especially when each penny has felt especially precious in recent years. So, setting the coveted category awards aside, it's definitely tricky to pick one techie thing that really spoke to me this year.

Depending on who you ask it may not even be Obsidian's best game this year—at least one PCG editor thinks it was Grounded 2 , and I almost couldn't choose between it and Avowed. It speaks to the studio's deep bench and catalogue that in a year Obsidian launched two other games, The Outer Worlds 2 is still a standout. Obsidian's games rarely seem to get the praise they're due at launch, for one reason or another. Pillars of Eternity, Pentiment, and the first Outer Worlds strike me as notable exceptions. Otherwise, KotOR 2, Mask of the Betrayer, New Vegas, Alpha Protocol, Tyranny, and Deadfire are all games that took years to achieve cult classic status, let alone the couple that have finally become universally acknowledged classics.

I don't think 2025 is going to go down as a vintage year for the tech of our favourite hobby, but that doesn't mean we've been without either fantastic new toys to play with or new spins on gaming technology to throw at our games. Inevitably the biggest thing to happen to PCs in 2025 was two whole new generations of graphics cards launching from AMD and Nvidia respectively. Both had a lot to offer and both had a heap of problems—though interestingly they were largely more to do with marketing and product positioning than actual hardware issues…",

Subgenre trends happen all over gaming (the battle royale to extraction shooter pipeline, for instance) and cozy games are no exception. For a few years after Stardew Valley, absolutely everyone was making a farm sim. Then there was the influx of Townscaper-chasing cozy building games . This year it was the desktop idlers. (Image credit: Mister Morris Games, CaveLiquid, Moczan) They've got their roots back in the early 2000s when desktop pets were novelty applications that ran from your system tray in the bottom right. Back then, they were pretty minimal little apps that ran some simple animations and you could maybe have a couple interactions with. Desktop pets have completely evolved for their 2025 rebirth. No longer just glorified .gifs, they've become entire idler games ticking away in a fraction of your monitor just waiting for you to take a little break from work to poke at …",

It just shows off the game's \"game over\" screen, which sounds like the sort of thing that wouldn't be all that noteworthy, but the song slaps . Funky synth bass and warped, echoing samples glide over hip hop drums; it's the sort of dance-worthy defeat screen that salves the sting of losing in a frenzied arcade game. And if you haven't given Mindwave's demo a shot, that's exactly what it is. PC Gamer's Elie Gould sang the demo's praises in their impressions piece on it, and I similarly came away from it foaming at the mouth to play the full game. It's a chaotic mishmash of what WarioWare originally coined as \"micro-games\": dead simple minigames that you have mere seconds to complete, played one after another at mach speeds. It differentiates itself from the Nintendo series by being a bit more narrative; the Steam page bills it as \"…",

That stat comes courtesy of SteamDB , which gathered a list of the top ten best-selling games (excluding free-to-play games) from December 23 to today, December 30. There are plenty of familiar faces: the award-guzzling Clair Obscur, the absurdly excellent Baldur's Gate 3, and our favorite game of 2025, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. There's also some games that you just take for granted as always being best sellers: Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and the latest EA Sports FC, for example. But at the very top split only by the Steam Deck are Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6, two shooters that offer relatively intense, competitive styles of shooter (extraction and modern military) without all the sweat. There's not so much as a competitive ranked mode of play in BF6, and…",

But there is something GPU-related that can be a lot better, and that's frame generation. Ever since GPU upscaling and frame generation first appeared (DLSS 1.0 in 2019, DLSS 3.0 in 2022), I've always held the opinion that if you couldn't tell they were working, other than just from the performance lift, everyone would be happily using them by default. With the first iteration of both technologies and their corresponding alternatives from AMD and Intel, you could very much tell they were being used, and that's only served to tarnish their reputations. However, when it comes to upscaling these days, it's about as close to perfection as you can get. Assuming it's been properly implemented into a game, of course. When it's all working as intended, Quality or Balanced upscaling at most resolutions does an incredible job, and I always enable it in every game that supports the most recent versions. Alas, I c…",

Tech has hit a hard graphics plateau: raw generational updates are now nuanced upgrades measured in single-digit frame gains rather than evolutions anyone with eyes can appreciate, and the subsequent pivot to AI-generated frames and experimental hair follicles aren't really revving anyone's engines when those upgrades cost a month's rent. Even if the latest hardware really was all that, the precarious AI bubble is locking normal humans out of it anyway. It's good timing, then, that cutting edge graphics are increasingly irrelevant to keeping up with the hobby. A bright spot of 2025 was the continued rise of \"friendslop,\" a cringey internet-spawned label for a broad genre of cooperative games designed for groups of friends. Peak and REPO were the big hits this calendar year, but they're of a kind with Phasmophobia and Lethal Company—all were among the best-selling Steam games of their release years, and it's no coincidence that they'll all run on a budget PC from nine years ago.

I struggled to cajole my usual teammates to install updates over this period, let alone dedicate an evening to the game. I wasn't alone—the peak player count regularly dipped below 1.5m over this period, which would've seemed unthinkable a year ago. Yet 2025 also had some of my favorite Fortnite moments in years. The dopaminergic Blitz Royale arrived in June, and I played nothing else for weeks. The Fortnite Simpsons, complete with a standalone shrunken map, was surely one of the game's greatest-ever seasons.

Issues with drivers, hardware, and above all, pricing and availability made it hard to enjoy the thrill of new gaming tech. So, in a mess of a launch, who gets the nominations for the best graphics card of 2025? Well, thankfully the rest of the year took care of the failures of launch time, with all the new GPUs becoming far more affordable and far closer to MSRP (in some cases even below!), and now widely available, too.

Fans have been eagerly awaiting the second episode since then, but a development update on Steam confirmed yesterday that it won't hit its old release window of \"before the end of 2025.\" That said, it did share some exciting details, as well as a brief teaser. The teaser shows off a thing of beauty as hilarious as it is genuinely cool: a first-person car chase where the player smokes a cigar, blasts foes with a tommy gun through each window, and maneuvers with one foot on the steering wheel and another on the gas.

The rest of the update shows off some new areas, story comics, and teases Delia, a \"fully controllable NPC companion\" that responds to commands like \"move there,\" \"stay here,\" and \"shoot that fuckin' guy!\" It looks…",

Hackers went berserk in Siege over the weekend, and players reported a range of anomalies: receipt of billions of credits and ultra-rare or developer-only skins , and chaotic bans and unbans, including cheeky messages sent via the global ban ticker. (For instance, the lyrics to Shaggy's \"It Wasn't Me.\") Wtf pic.twitter.com/VuR0skohGC December 27, 2025 The bedlam carried on until Ubisoft brought the servers down entirely, as was confirmed on X . A follow-up shared that while no players would be punished for spending the random credits, all transactions from the time the incident started would be rolled back. It also clarified that the sudden influx of bans was part of the breach and that \"any messages seen\" via the ban ticker were not Ubisoft's doing, which I think was never in question given that one of them read \"Yves Guillemot was in the epstein files.\" The extent to which the game and any users were compromised is unclear, but the game is back up as of last night , December 28, but the in-game marketplace is still down.

GOG always had you covered when you got an itch to play some old '90s shooter that you lost the CD key to long ago. And according to its new owner, it has some big goals for next year and beyond when it comes to expanding its library of classic games. Announced today , GOG will now be in the hands of Michal Kicinski. Kicinski isn't some random suit, however, he was a co-founder of GOG when it started in 2008 under CD Projekt Red—which he also co-founded. Everything about GOG will stay the same, including the games available on the platform and everyone's library of games. Kicinski preached GOG's goal of being a place for \"freedom, independence, and genuine control,\" over the games you own in the announcement post. \"This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision,\" the post reads. \"We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.\" It's also pointed out in the post that GOG has plans to \"undertake even more …",

We knew we were getting the druid because it didn't quite make the cut for 0.3, but apart from that it seemed a little mopey—no new campaign bits, a league mechanic we already recognized from PoE1, and most importantly, no endgame changes. I came away from the presentation with a big ole' meh. That changed the first time I reared up as a bear and slapped a zombie with my big, meaty paw. Say what you want about the pacing change between PoE2 and its predecessor, I really do find the combat to be more fun. Early bosses especially have that tough soulslike feel, and having to do more than just activate Righteous Fire and meander through loot explosions actually makes me enjoy the game more. That's in part down to how the skills are designed to make you use them in concert and the monsters themselves, but perhaps the biggest factor is the new character rigs that have let GGG make some really satisfying skills. When the druid rears up on its hind legs in bear form to smack things with Maul, you feel huge . The smacks are meaty and crunchy, and when you slam back down to do the second part of the…",

Last year, I made my 2025 hardware wishlist , and I absolutely nailed it when it came to Valve's products. Three in a row, literally. Steam Machines ? Yep, here they come. Steam Controller ? You bet. And a new Steam VR headset —do you even need to ask? (Image credit: Future) And listen, I can already hear the 'shotgun approach' and 'broken clock' sniggers at the back, but I shan't hear it.

I've always liked the idea of a charging dock conceptually, but I've never quite committed to getting a bit of gaming gear with one for a specific reason: I'm a bit lazy. I was worried I'd pay a premium for a bit of hardware, and then forget to charge it, so end up leaving it plugged in anyway, thus removing the whole point of getting it in the first place. Well, I and all my hubris didn't account for two ways that 8BitDo's Retro R8 would counter those points. First is that its retail price is $50 (with it going as low as $35 already). The second is that it looks so good, I can't help but put it on its well-earned throne. See, the Retro R8 I reviewed earlier this year comes in an NES-style theming, with a smattering of whites, greys, reds, and blacks. It looks incredible next to my 8BitDo Retro keyboard . The stand itself plugs into the PC via a USB Type-C cable, and you can pop a dongle from the bottom of the mouse into the stand.
