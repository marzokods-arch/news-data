The theft from Paris’ Louvre Museum—one of the world’s most surveilled cultural institutions—took just under eight minutes. Visitors kept browsing.

This strategy worked because we don’t see the world objectively. We see it through categories—through what we expect to see. The thieves understood the social categories that we perceive as “normal” and exploited them to avoid suspicion. Many artificial intelligence (AI) systems work in the same way and are vulnerable to the same kinds of mistakes as a result. The sociologist Erving Goffman would describe what happened at the…",

While the prices aren’t quite as low as they once were, the new OnePlus 15 still delivers on value. Priced at $899, this phone sports the latest and most powerful Snapdragon processor, the largest battery in a mainstream smartphone, and a super-fast screen. The OnePlus 15 still doesn’t deliver the most satisfying software experience, and the camera may actually be a step back for the company, but the things OnePlus gets right are very right. It’s a fast, sleek phone that runs for ages on a charge, and it’s a little cheaper than the competition. But its shortcomings make it hard to recommend this device over the latest from Google or Samsung—or even the flagship phone OnePlus released ten months ago. US buyers have time to mull it over, though. Because of the recent government shutdown, FCC approval of the OnePlus 15 has been delayed. The company says it will release the phone as soon as it can, but there’s no exact date yet. Read full article Comments",

      "body": "يرى الخبير القانوني أحمد الشيخي، أن الهلال سيتفوق على البرازيلي رينان لودي، في النزاع القائم بينهما، بشأن قضية فسخ عقد اللاعب من طرف واحد. وكان لودي قد قرر فسخ عقده من طرف واحد، بعدما اتخذ الإيطالي سيموني إنزاجي، المدير الفني للفريق، قرارا باستبعاده من القائمة المحلية. وبناء على ذلك، قرر الهلال التحرك قانونيًا ضد اللاعب لضمان حقوقه المادية والتأديبية، في الوقت الذي أشارت فيه تقارير صحفية إلى أن اللاعب تقدم بشكوى ضد النادي. نجاح متوقع قال الشيخي في تصريحات تلفزيونية بشأن هذا الأمر: \"الهلال يمتلك فرصة كبيرة للفوز في القضية الحالية، لأنه يملك سجلًا قويًا في القضايا الخارجية، وإذا استمرت دون الوصول إلى تسوية فالأقرب أن يحسمها لصالحه\". ومع ذلك، أوضح الشيخي أن الملف لا يزال محفوفًا بالمخاطر، لأن العديد من السوابق القانونية سواء لدى فيفا أو المحكمة الرياضية الدولية جاءت في مصلحة اللاعبين، مضيفًا: \"بعض المحكمين يرون أن أي لاعب لديه ما يثبت أنه لم يُسجَّل أو لم يشارك في المباريات يحق له فسخ عقده، وربما اعتمد لودي على هذا النوع من السوابق\". وتابع: \"كانت هناك قضية طرفها الأهلي، ورجّح كثيرون عدم فوزه، لكنه انتصر. لذلك قد يكون لدى الهلال رد قوي في قضية لودي سيقدمه للمحكمة خلال 3 أسابيع\". طلبات لودي وتطرق الشيخي خلال حديثه عن طلبات لودي، قائلا: \"لودي قدم طلبًا رسميًا إلى الاتحاد الدولي لكرة الق…",

The Republican plan drew rave reviews from cable lobby groups, however. A House subcommittee moved ahead with the plan today despite the opposition from local leaders and criticism from congressional Democrats. Under the bills, some kinds of local telecom projects would be approved automatically if a city or town doesn’t rule within a deadline set by Congress. “These bills represent an unprecedented federal intrusion into established local decision-making processes, favoring large broadband, telecommunications, wireless, and cable companies at the expense of residents and taxpayers,” four groups representing local leaders wrote in a letter to US lawmakers. “These bills strip local governments of the ability to effectively manage the infrastructure built on local streets and in neighborhoods, while imposing no reciprocal obligations on providers.” Read full article Comments",

The DoorDasher was a 23-year-old woman named Olivia Henderson, and she felt like the whole situation was some kind of creepy exploitation play. Was this guy purposely exposing himself to her? Was he even asleep? Should she have to endure the sight of random male genitalia just to make a few bucks? She did not think so, and she decided to do something about it. Henderson filmed the man from outside the home, and she later posted the video on TikTok to shame him. Naturally, it went viral. Read full article Comments",

The Times obtained a recording of a call during which officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to state health departments that the ongoing measles outbreak at the border of Arizona and Utah is a continuation of the explosive outbreak in West Texas that began in mid- to late-January. That is, the two massive outbreaks are being caused by the same subtype of measles virus. This is a significant link that hasn’t previously been reported despite persistent questions from journalists and concerns from health experts, particularly in light of Canada losing its elimination status last week . The loss of an elimination status means that measles will once again be considered endemic to the US, an embarrassing public health backslide for a vaccine-preventable disease.

      "body": "If you’ve ever tried to hook an old Nintendo 64 up to a modern HDTV, you know the results can be less than ideal. Assuming your original hardware still works and your flatscreen even has the requisite R/F and/or composite inputs to allow for the connection, the N64’s output will probably look like a blurry mess on a flatscreen that wasn’t designed with those old video signals as a priority. The Analogue 3D solves this very specific problem very well, with a powerful FPGA core that accurately replicates a Nintendo 64 and well-made display filters that do a good job of approximating that cathode-ray tube glow you remember from decades ago. But the lack of easy expandability limits the appeal of this $250 device to all but the most die-hard fans of original N64 hardware. A beauty to behold As a piece of physical design, the Analogue 3D is a work of art. The gentle curves of its sleek black shell evoke the original N64 design without copying it, coming in at a slightly smaller footprint and height. Plus, there’s no ugly power brick.

Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States. As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia. Before finalizing the deal, the family office had asked to meet Halliburton in person. Read full article Comments",

Speaking exclusively to the BBC at Google’s California headquarters, Pichai acknowledged that while AI investment growth is at an “extraordinary moment,” the industry can “overshoot” in investment cycles, as we’re seeing now. He drew comparisons to the late 1990s Internet boom, which saw early Internet company valuations surge before collapsing in 2000, leading to bankruptcies and job losses. “We can look back at the Internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the Internet was profound,” Pichai said. “I expect AI to be the same. So I think it’s both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.” Read full article Comments",

Amazon MGM Studios has released a new trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary , which is based on Andy Weir’s ( The Martian ) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space. Weir told The New York Times that the inspiration for his novel came from a planned multi-book space opera called Zhek that he began writing after The Martian , about a potential fuel for interstellar travel. He eventually abandoned that effort and wrote the 2017 novel, Artemis , instead, but aspects of Zhek found their way into the Project Hail Mary novel. As we’ve previously reported , Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian , so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller ( Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie ) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star.

Musk’s robotaxis are a little closer to reality, with a kind of limited service being offered in Austin, Texas, as well as parts of San Francisco. But Tesla might need to rethink its approach to safety drivers after a Tesla rideshare passenger in San Francisco took to Reddit to share a video of the operator asleep in the driver’s seat. In fact, the safety driver fell asleep three times during the ride, which took place a little over a week ago, according to Reddit user ohmichael. In his post, which contains a 12-second clip of a man sleeping and then waking in the front seat of a moving Tesla, the poster says he contacted Tesla to report this behavior but never heard back.

      "body": "When the Trump administration brutally cut federal funding for biomedical research earlier this year, at least 383 clinical trials that were already in progress were abruptly canceled, cutting off over 74,000 trial participants from their experimental treatments, monitoring, or follow-ups, according to a study published today in JAMA Internal Medicine . The study, led by researchers at Harvard, fills a knowledge gap of how the Trump administration’s research funding cuts affected clinical trials specifically. It makes clear not just the wastefulness and inefficiency of the cuts but also the deep ethical violations, JAMA Internal Medicine editors wrote in an accompanying editor’s note . In March, the National Institutes of Health, under the control of the Trump administration, announced that it would cancel $1.8 billion in grant funding that wasn’t aligned with the administration’s priorities. The Harvard researchers, led by health care policy expert Anupam Jena, used an NIH database and a federal accountability tracking tool to find grants supporting clinical trials that were active as of February 28 but had been terminated by August 15.

That’s now changing as he takes on the role of co-CEO of a new AI company, according to a New York Times report citing three people familiar with the company. Grandiosely named Project Prometheus (and not to be confused with the NASA project of the same name), the company will focus on using AI to pursue breakthroughs in research, engineering, manufacturing, and other fields that are dubbed part of “the physical economy”—in contrast to the software applications that are likely the first thing most people in the general public think of when they hear “AI.” Bezos’ co-CEO will be Vik Bajaj, a chemist and physicist who previously led life sciences work at Google X, an Alphabet-backed research group that worked on speculative projects that could lead to more product categories. (For example, it developed technologies that would later underpin Google’s Waymo service.) Bajaj also worked at Verily, another Alphabet-backed research group focused on life sciences, and Foresite Labs, an incubator for new AI companies. Read full article Comments",
