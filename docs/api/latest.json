Truly, these numbers are getting silly. Of course, it really, really (really!) wasn't all that long ago we reported on Nvidia becoming the world's most valuable company at $3.3 trillion . It was only a few months ago that Nvidia breached $4 trillion . But now here we are at $5 trillion. Where does it all end? Increasingly, market observers think the whole AI thing is a bubble set to catastrophically burst . Or maybe AI is the real deal, and an apocalypse of a very different kind will be upon us soon enough . But one thing is for sure. Whatever the outcome, there's no doubting Nvidia will have been absolutely pivotal. It dominates the AI industry when it comes to both hardware and the software development platforms on which it is all built. But as I watched CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address at the GTC event yesterday , his narrative around Nvidia was just a little too neat, a bit too cute. If you take Huang at his implied word, Nvidia saw it all coming. Personally, I think a fair bit of luck was involved. At GTC, Huang pointed…",

And thanks to these gorgeous remasters everyone can easily acquaint themselves with their importance and nod in sage agreement when someone claims it's possible to draw a line from Dragon Quest's \"little guy goes on a big adventure\" to Clair Obscur. I'm pretty sure that's what I'm supposed to say as a certified fan of ye olden dayes , anyway. Sometimes I feel like my job is to make sure these new-old games are digested in the \"correct\" way. I dish out appropriate explanations/excuses for their age and mumble phrases like \"timeless classic\" and \"historical context\" as I do so. Surely it'd be a complete waste of a re-release if these titans weren't respected as interactive history lessons, right? But what if there was another, better reason to play them that had nothing to do with the word \"nostalgic?\" What if I said you should pick them…",

In other words, you're spoilt for choice. But in a mode where your chances of success are at least in part determined by what gear you have, what you really need are the best guns . As you'd expect from a battle royale, the types of skirmishes you'll get into in Battlefield Redsec are more varied, so you'll need guns to compete in a variety of different situations. SMGs and shotguns may be lethal up close, but you're going to want something with a bit more damage at range to pick up the slack when you're in a long-distance relationship with your enemy. Below, I'll go over all the weapons you should look out for while looting or use in a custom loadout in Battlefield 6 Redsec.

You might have noticed this worrying trend if you've been looking for a RAM upgrade lately. Charts on pcpartpicker.com are telling: since mid-2025, DDR4 and DDR5 consumer memory kit prices have been climbing, with particularly notable spikes since September. That's true all the way from DDR4-3200 kits up to DDR5-6000 ones. To take one concrete example, this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 kit on Amazon , which was stable at $95 or less throughout most of the year, but from mid-August onward started climbing. Now, it's up to $184, which makes for a 94% increase. This, after a good few months of sustained DDR5 price drops through the tail end of 2024 and first half of 2025. DDR4 isn't safe, either, as this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4-3600 kit on Amazon shows.

Well, I'd argue it's when you need to strap a bunch of external devices to it in order to get the most out of it, which is exactly what's happened to the Strix Halo-powered OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex . It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

In very simple terms, that means the Vera Rubin superchip sports 60 times the number of transistors of an Nvidia RTX 5090 gaming GPU . And that is a completely bananas comparison. What's more, the Vera Rubin superchip is capable of 100 petaflops of raw compute. And that is exactly 100 times more compute than Nvidia claims for its neat little DGX Spark AI box . Oh, and it packs 88 custom Arm cores suporting 176 software threads for conventional CPU compute, too. On a side note, that Arm CPU bit (which alone is known as Vera) is interesting from a PC perspective as you might expect its custom designed CPU cores, which notably support multi-threading, could turn up in a PC processor in the future. Watch this space. At this point you may be wondering how any of this is possible. Six trillion transistors, 100 PF of compute, 88 CPU cores, all in one chip? OK, Vera Rubin is expected…",

I haven't had as long as I'd like with Embark's new extraction shooter, so this review is indeed in progress, with the final version coming sometime in the future when I've had a chance to properly experience it in all of its intersocial beauty. The premise of Arc Raiders is simple: the world has gone to hell thanks to robots and AI, so now all the humans are holed up in small communities underground, with you and other raiders occasionally popping up to the surface to gather resources to trade, create gear, and upgrade your base. On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff. You have to navigate these problems all while finding loot and extracting before the timer runs out. Escaping Tarkov Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark Studios) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: E…",

During yesterday's GTC keynote presentation , Huang explained how it was—who'd a thunk it?!—Nvidia GPUs that would unlock the potential of quantum computing. Huang outlined how the individual bits of quantum computing, known as qubits, are inherently unstable, only surviving for a few hundred operations. But \"solving meaningful problems requires trillions of operations,\" Huang said. \"The answer is quantum error correction. Measuring disturbs a qubit which destroys the information inside it. The trick is to add extra qubits—entangled—so that measuring them gives us enough information to calculate where errors occurred without damaging the qubits we care about.\" In this scenario, hundreds of entangled qubits combine to form a single, error-corrected logical qubit inside a QPU or quantum processing unit.

What if I told you there's a way to get around this in the Battlefield 6 battle royale Redsec, if only you show some restraint? It's only explained in a loading screen or in-game tip (if you haven't turned those off) that you can melee downed enemies to perform a shakedown . This will play a short takedown animation that will reveal the positions of any remaining squadmates, whether it's one lone straggler or three of them. It's easy to miss the prompt, so be careful not to do a standard melee swing, as that won't reveal enemies, and you risk outright killing the downed enemy instead.

I'm enjoying its glorious exploding oil derricks and the way its rolling hills and minimal building cover emphasizes vehicle play, but its major flaw is abundantly clear, because it's the same flaw that's been grinding everybody's gears since Battlefield 6's beta: several of the maps that Battlefield 6 considers \"large\" are actually pretty small. Blackwell Fields isn't big enough. New Sobek City isn't big enough. Siege of Cairo isn't big enough. Iberian Offensive isn't big enough. Empire State isn't big enough. We're beyond coincidence. There's a serious disconnect between what DICE and the rest of Battlefield Studios believe Battlefield maps should look like and what a lot of players obviously want, and I think I've identified an important reason why.

Considering that Vampire Survivors was one of the first games featured in Balatro's first Friends of Jimbo update —a collaboration that both games have followed with more crossovers than I'm willing to count—it's only fitting that Jimbo would return the favor for the update that makes Vampire Survivors more of a communal experience than ever before. Alongside the online co-op mode in which up to four players can roam freely around the map while leveling up together, the Ante Chamber expansion adds Balatro's Jimbo and a trio of rare jokers as playable characters, four similarly Balatro-themed weapons including a burning score counter and a banana barrage, and the titular Ante Chamber stage.

The second punch, delivered near the end of the year, was ZSNES, which did the same for much newer Super Nintendo games. And it was fast —even on the modest PCs of the era. \"When I was 16 years old I started learning assembly, and I got so fascinated with optimization, making everything as fast as possible,\" said zsKnight, the developer behind ZSNES, in an interview last week . While most software is written in higher level programming languages like C++ that are easier to work with, even at a young age zsKnight was skilled enough in low level assembly language to start using it to program his own emulator.
