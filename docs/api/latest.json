That's right: his majesty Carl Philip, duke of Värmland and prince of Sweden. We all know that the good prince knows his GTA 5s from his Herzog Zweis, which makes it all the more galling that the Excellent Swedish Design award has never been given to a videogame before now. I suppose I can blame that on Svensk Form, or the Swedish Design Association, the non-profit which doles out the award annually. Split Fiction was one of a dozen recipients alongside not-videogames like the TP-7 field recorder by Teenage Engineering and a furniture collection called The King's Hat. It isn't possible to apply for the award, but Svensk Form's inclusion of game designer Bobbi A. Sand in the curation jury may have had something to do with the co-op platformer's nomination.

Prompted by a 2020 Guardian article that asked experts why some gamers naturally prefer inverted controls—even if some of us consider it an affront to both ethical convention and good taste—visual perception and cognitive neuroscience researchers Dr Jennifer Corbett and Dr Jaap Munneke surveyed hundreds of remote subjects to study the neurological implications of controller inversion preference.

      "body": "Finding and crafting the Sawblade Launcher in Dying Light: The Beast is a real turning point in Techland's new zombie-stomping parkour horror. It's by far the best ranged weapon in the game, dishing out instant death for lesser infected and human enemies by slicing right through them, and taking huge bites out of the health bars of even the biggest and deadliest boss monsters. Plus, this is the zombie apocalypse. Of course you should be able to craft a weapon that fires spinning sawblades. (Image credit: Techland) Thing is, the blueprint for the Sawblade Launcher isn't easy to find in Dying Light: The Beast unless you know exactly where to look. It's hidden way, way off in a section of the map you might not explore until late in the game. I was level 9 before I found it (and I finished the game at level 13), so I spent most of the game without it. But the Sawblade Launcher blueprint is in a level 6 area of the map, so you should be able to get your hands on it much earlier than I did. Where to find the Sawblade Launcher blueprint Start by opening your map. From the town hall, look for the northern-most point of Old Town , where the town ends at the river. From there, look east, al…",

PCG's Nick Evanson notes that \"every major Borderlands game has run like a bag of frogs juggling bowling balls on release\" and this time is no exception. \"We're reading every piece of feedback you share,\" says the Gearbox statement , which makes you feel a little bad for the poor staffer charged with that duty. \"We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes.

If that sounds like the beginning of a eulogy…yeah. It isn't technically dead, and there's a universe where BioWare makes some incredible comeback with Mass Effect 4, but I don't think it's this one. After Andromeda, Anthem, and Veilguard, it seems that no matter the talent still left in the studio, EA just isn't going to give BioWare the time or trust to make the kind of RPGs it originally spearheaded anymore. I'm finally ready to let go. If you too are mourning the studio's effective downfall, rest assured that the BioWare-style RPG lives on elsewhere. My colleague Fraser Brown insisted back in 2023 that the BioWare-style RPG was dead and just didn't know it yet.

With Techland posting some seriously heavy system requirements and Nvidia partnering once more for RTX and DLSS additions , I was concerned that Dying Light: The Beast would be joining a growing list of recent games that don't run very well on PC. Having tested the game on a broad range of hardware, I can tell you now that it's actually all fine, even when the performance is lower than you'd like. This is especially true if you stick to 1080p or 1440p, and even though Dying Light: The Beast proudly wears an 'I love upscaling' t-shirt, you should have no problems getting a respectable frame rate on most modern gaming PCs.

You're still getting that sweet, sweet 3D V-Cache technology and the gaming performance boosts that come with it, but at a lower price point than usual, which allows you to throw a little more cash at the points that really matter to you. Being a six-core CPU with 96 MB of L3 cache, it's sort of like a Ryzen 7 7800X3D (the CPU in my home rig) but with two fewer cores and a lower clock speed. When it launched late last year, it was initially a US-only Micro Center exclusive, with limited availability. In a rig like this, one with a beefy GPU but at a mid-range price point, getting 3D cache for the cheapest possible seems like a smart play.

What's more, perhaps you could be in it, provided you could play any of: a young Colin Farrell-type male (aged 30-39) of any ethnicity, a female co-lead alien character requiring prosthetics (34-39), a female human at the centre of a separate-but-corresponding plot on Earth, a Doug Jones-type male villain (40-60), or a male wrestler-type soldier (30-49). That's a casting call recently leaked by industry in-crowd figure Daniel Richtman (via Eurogamer ), and I don't think I fit any of them, so I guess I'm stuck in the games journalism mines. Anyway, with there being zero information out there about what the show's plot will focus on, the leak has inevitably led to a flurry of speculation about just who, from the games, each character refers to. A young Colin Farrell-type male could easily be Shepard. Tragically, male Shepard, which would be the objectively incorrect choice, but I guess Amazon hasn't seen my frequent emails on the subj…",

Pink is far from my favourite colour, as I tend to sport a more pro-purple agenda, but I'm not eager to kick out Razer's latest iteration of the Kraken Kitty headset. Available in both white and black colourways alongside the aforementioned 'quartz', the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro headset offers more than the novelty of feline flair. Costing $180/£180, it had better. As with every Kraken Kitty, the cat ears remain the crown jewel of this headset. To be clear, the charming interchangeable ears of the pricy V2 Pro are gone; we're now back to full-size animal ears rather than the V2 Pro's oddly diminutive accessories throwing off the proportions of what is an already bulky headset. The kitty ears here are sturdy, solidly anchored to the headband, and immediately eye-catching. With all of that hardware on top, you may think the V3 Pro would be fatiguing to wear.

There are detailed instructions on how to set it up on your Windows handheld on Reddit, thanks to user Gogsi123 (via The Verge ). The basic idea, though, is to become a Windows Insider, update to 25H2, and then if you can't see the option in your Settings, you can use ViVeTool to enable the feature (some of you might remember using this tool to enable Copilot features before they officially rolled out in some regions).

Oh, and Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel. Hold that thought. The announcement says the partnership will span both enterprise-class AI products and consumer PCs. It's the latter we're most interested in, of course, so here's what the statement has to say about that specifically: \"For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.\" And that really is it, barring some platitudes rolled out by Intel and Nvidia's CEOs, Lip Bu Tan and Jensen Huang respectively.

More often than not, that also includes you, which can get pretty awkward as there's usually nothing left standing for you to kill to revive yourself. But what if I told you that there was another way? Some other shotgun that does brain-breaking damage that won't kill you in the process, and is somehow a random-ass purple item?

Based on the reactions and vengeful affect of returning Dying Light 1 protagonist Kyle Crane, it seems the juice was bad. And yet it helps you kill zombies, so it might be good? Such are the fascinating moral complexities offered by zombie fiction. Perhaps the true beast… is humanity!? Or it's the guy with experimental zombie super strength who can rip mutants apart with his bare hands. Hard to say. If you're desperate to learn when you'll be able to go Beast mode in the latest Dying Light, don't fret: You won't have to endure years of zombie DNA experimentation.

In the original Hollow Knight, accessing Steel Soul Mode meant defeating the main game at least once. In Silksong the same is true, except there is also another easier and quicker way to unlock it too. But first, what is it? Steel Soul Mode is basically a permadeath mode for Silksong. When you die it's game over, and if you try to re-access the save file you'll be asked if you want to overwrite it. There's no going back, and as a result some items related to death have also changed in Steel Soul mode. For example: the Dead Bug's Purse, a tool which lets you retain half of your rosaries on death, becomes a Shell Satchel, which increases Hornet's tool pouch size. If Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode is any indication, there will also be some minor changes and additions in the adventure that will make the punishment worthwhile for completionists.

Did I immediately intuit, as someone well-versed in the sicko behavior of gaming speedrunners, that three hours was probably a really fast clear time for this indie game with its throwback 8-bit graphics that includes its own built-in randomizer? Of course not. \"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere near finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me. Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight—and the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.

Mists of Pandaria Remix had some hiccups early on, but Blizzard was quick to fix them and let players have their fun for the duration of the event. But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff. Blizzard quickly issued a response , saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing.

Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts . While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons. Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence.

It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup. \"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site.

Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range—which looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set. Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree.

Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t…",

The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation.

Well, that last group should be particularly pleased with Microsoft's latest Copilot announcement, as the app is said to be installing alongside most desktop versions of Microsoft's 365 suite of apps next month—whether you like it or not. \"Starting in October 2025, Microsoft will begin automatically installing the Microsoft 365 Copilot app on Windows devices that have Microsoft 365 desktop client apps,\" says MS in a message center update, according to Bleeping Computer . \"This app provides a centralized entry point for accessing Copilot experiences and AI-powered capabilities across Microsoft 365.
