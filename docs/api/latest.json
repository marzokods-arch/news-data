It's Gundam at its most Evangelion, and it's got plenty of interchangeable weapons, hands, and an alternate head. Key specs: 1/144 scale | Snap-fit assembly | Wow cool robot View Deal We here at PC Gamer love a mech. Whether we're looking at a big stompy battle hulk in the Battletech tradition or something closer to the Armored Core school of air-dashing, hover-skating war machines, we're an outlet more than willing to say \"wow, cool robot.\" For some of us, it's a fascination that runs deep enough to bleed over into the physical. If you've found yourself (or someone you love (sorry)) wishing for a more material mecha pastime, Gundam plastic models—or Gunpla—will get you there. A word of warning: Gunpla sickness settles in fast. I only built my first kit about a year and a half ago, but as I write this, there are two displayed mobile suits, three assembled models in boxes, and one unopened kit awaiting assembly in my field of vision. But if you're ready for your first dose of mecha-building brain poison—as brain poisons go, it's a pretty good one—there are some great Cyber Monday deals to get you on you…",

Fans have speculated for years as to whether he's a virus-infected mutant, a radiation-poisoned ghoul, both, or neither, and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has weighed in on the debate with a larger point: any interpretation is right, so long as it's designated as such. He said as much in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel yesterday—the same channel where he routinely shares insights and commentary from his entire body of gamedev work, including everything from the original Fallout to Wildstar and The Outer Worlds. The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't. To summarize, his argument is thus: canon is \"whatever the owner of the IP says it is,\" an individual's interpretation is personal and freeform and therefore \"you can't be wrong,\" and authorial intent is another matter altogether that usually differs from team member to team member, and may even diverge greatly from canon.

It used to be normal to play PC games with speakers, before we got obsessed with positional audio and wanted headsets with microphones so we could yell at each other over TeamSpeak. But you don't have to shrink your aural experience when you're all by yourself. Let your ears breathe! Below, I've recommended deals on two sets of desktop speakers I've actually used and like. My current pair is the Audioengine HD3, which don't go on sale all that much, so the current sale price at Amazon and at Audioengine is a genuine deal. These are the speakers I currently own. They look great, and sound plenty good for the size. The connection options make them very versatile: Bluetooth, USB, RCA, and 3.5mm aux. Get a bigger pair of bookshelf speakers if you're building an audiophile hi-fi setup, but for a warm sound in a stylish form that's easy to stick on your desk and connect to your PC or phone, I'm very happy with these.

A big part of the experience is managing your stash and selling anything that doesn't make the cut—well, if you're good enough at extracting with all of your loot. (Image credit: Embark) But first, you need to know what to sell. Learning which items are worth the most Raider Coins will mean you can buy more parts and weapons when times get tough. And knowing which ones you'll need for crafting and quests is crucial so you don't get stuck later on (it'd be nice if the game told you this, unfortunately it doesn't). Knowing the worth of items will also help you decide what to take back to Speranza with you when you're looting Topside.

Like roughly half of the internet, I am fascinated by Kowloon Walled City . Built on the site of a military fort, the Walled City was a Chinese enclave situated within former British Hong Kong. Its existence was tolerated by Britain provided China made no effort to exercise its jurisdiction. This peculiar legal status left it largely ignored by both nations, and as such it became the site of rapid, unplanned urban development through the latter half of the 20 th Century. At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth.

The vast majority of people who play this Geometry Wars -inspired roguelike love it too, as its 97% positive Steam rating attests. But Steam's rapidly revolving release tombola means that making a great game is no guarantee of commercial success. And as Sektori's developer recently explained, the kaleidoscopic schmup is still a long way from making him any money. Reacting to Sektori's launch on Bluesky, former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen said reception to the twin-stick shooter had been \"awesome\" and \"much more than I expected for such a niche thing\". Lahtinen fully appreciates the highly specific appeal of Geometry Wars-style games, likely why Housemarque itself pivoted to making third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros. Now though, Lahtinen says the response to Sektori has given him hope. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. I went into this fully knowing I would never recoup. It would be my calling card, but nothing people would have ever heard of,\" he says. \"But 100+ Steam reviews, 97% positive + ~90 Metacritic is unexpected to say the least.\" Following this, …",

MindsEye was thoroughly unpleasant to play, panned by players and critics alike (including myself , to be fully transparent). The fallout from its failure was even less savoury, with Build A Rocket Boy's boss Leslie Benzies reportedly blaming the game's failure on 'saboteurs', before the studio laid off more than a hundred employees. Some of those axed designers then accused Build A Rocket Boy of mismanagement and a total lack of direction, claiming that Benzies \"never decided what game he wanted to make\".

Released last week, Cleared Hot has racked up a 98% 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating out of 1,200 reviews —not bad considering it's an early access title based on a genre that had its heyday more than 30 years ago. The main appeal of Cleared Hot is how it takes the template laid down by EA and upgrades the action with modern spectacle.

The good news is that there are plenty of deals to be found on every type and flavor of GPU, whatever your budget may be. 👉 The best Cyber Monday PC gaming deals right here 👈 However, you probably shouldn't expect to see huge discounts on every graphics card on the market. Top-end models like the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 are actually going back up in price, and the entry-level sector has such tight profit margins that big savings are unlikely. So it's the mainstream and mid-range models that are the ones to watch out for. The RTX 5060 Ti , RTX 5070 from Nvidia, and the RX 9070 from AMD could all be well worth snapping up this Cyber Monday.

We know prices are only likely to rise, however, so it might well be that the SSD deals over Cyber Monday are as good as it gets for a while. As far as size is concerned, 1 TB is the least amount of storage you want when shopping around for an SSD. It might be tempting to go with something smaller because the price is right, but you'd be surprised how fast a 256 GB or even a 512 GB drive can fill up after installing a handful of games.

From 1440p beats to higher competitive 1080p panels, all the way to something lush and OLED, there are plenty of different monitors to get your teeth stuck into. Though please don't actually bite your monito. Still, 1440p remains the sweet spot for those of you looking for the best bang for your buck, and we've seen a steady march of excellent contenders released in the last year, so expect to see some good discounts, particularly for models with a larger panel size. 1080p stays as the budget choice, but given the influx of high refresh rate screens, it's safe to say this resolution is sticking around as the…",

Its next patch will introduce two new superweapons to its near-future conflict—one for each faction—each with the potential to reshape the battlefield. Introduced to Tempest Rising \"by popular demand\" , the superweapons take the form of base structures and come equipped with a powerful standard ability, plus the potential to \"unload devastating payloads\" onto your opponent. The GDF's superweapon of choice is the drone strike station, which Slipgate summarises as \"a battle-management node that syncs directly with the GDF's satellite constellations to coordinate orbital strikes\". When constructed, it establishes a \"massive vision radius\" around itself, significantly expanding the range at which the GDF can use their intel-based abilities. (Image credit: Slipgate Ironworks) Once fully charged, the station can send a signal into orbit to call in a drone strike at player-designated coordinates. When you hit that big red button, nine drone turrets plummet to the ground like meteors, dealing massive explosive da…",

There's been no better time to try it than its 15th anniversary, as the original game is going for just $1.19 on Steam . That's the lowest it's ever been, with a price of $5.99 standing as the steepest discount recorded by SteamDB in the last two years: that's a jump from 70% to 94% off. You can also get the bundle with all the games in the series that made it to Steam for a little over $13. Thematically it's somewhere between a high school drama, Saw, and an Agatha Christie novel, with a psychotic teddy bear turning an academy into a prison of murder and mischief. While it is a visual novel, it's more gamey than the genre name perhaps implies: you investigate murders as they happen and try to pin the deed on the right culprit in a stylish minigame, literally \"firing their words back at them\" with metaphorical truth bullets.

All big hits, but Team Cherry isn't holding out for the big prize. Pellen said they may not attend the show as they're \"pretty busy,\" and said he was confident they wouldn't have to record an acceptance speech either.

Intel used to make chips for Apple, well, Apple used to use Intel CPUs, but those processors were based on x86 architecture—and, I'm sorry to say, were nowhere near as impressive as Apple's own M-series chips. Apple's move to making its own chips signified an end to its partnership with Intel, but also the beginning of a new era, one where the M-series consistently obliterates its competitors in performance-per-watt. Apple doesn't seem to be changing its mind where the M-series is concerned, though.

To that end, Noctua has just quietly shared some good news for those who are already on an Intel platform: its coolers will still work with Intel's upcoming LGA1954 socket. The company wrote on its FAQ page that the same coolers that have worked with the LGA1700 (Intel Alder Lake and Raptor Lake), as well as LGA1851 (Intel Arrow Lake), will remain compatible once the next gen rolls around. Noctua products aren't exactly cheap, but they're powerful, which is why we deem the Noctua NH-D15 to be the best CPU air cooler . But it's one pricey beast.

Oh, and you can ride flying Arcs like a floating chariot . I've never seen it happen myself, but this feat of bravery isn't exactly news anymore; get to high ground, jump on top, and hope it doesn't buck you off.

Daddy Rank. What's Daddy Rank?

Could that—even, should that—model apply to the Steam Machine? The publishing director of Larian Studios, the outfit behind Baldur's Gate 3 among other high-profile games, clearly thinks so. I know subsidising hardware is unfashionable now but surely they're losing far more than a ~200$ difference by not having people on the storefront, which is essentially a money printing machine.

Spotted by MP1st , the European trademark filing wasn't made by Remedy but by a company called Nordia Law, a law firm with offices in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, where Remedy is based. But Nordia does have a history with Remedy: It provided legal advice to the studio in its Control 2 contract negotiations with 505 Games, for instance, (a deal that has since been undone ) and also assisted in negotiating financing deals with Tencent and Annapurna . So there's some real history there. It's no secret that a Control sequel is in development: Remedy said so back in 2022. Whether Control Resonant is that sequel is an open question, however. The trademark filing covers a lot of ground, from \"computer gaming software\" to \"printed matter\" like books and magazines, television shows, movies, music, clothing, and even, for some reason, \"lanyards for holding keys.\" It's pretty broad, in other words, and the title could be a reference to something other than a new …",

Given how expensive RAM is right now, many gamers are holding off on their upgrades in the hopes that the market will improve in the next few months. It makes sense—when you're seeing RAM kits sold for twice the price that they used to be sold for, it's hard not to want to wait it out. The Black Friday sales have only highlighted this, when we look back at the offers around Prime Day in July—just over four months ago, remember—we've seen prices rising from $170 for a 64 GB DDR5 kit to at least $600. However, Santos says that if you want to get your upgrades, it's better to act fast. When faced with a question regarding memory shortages that could potentially extend into 2027 (oh, joy) and how to navigate rising prices, Santos said: \"For consumers that are interested in getting a new PC or upgrading their current system’s GPU, SSD or R…",
