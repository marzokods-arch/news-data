Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor are both on sale on Steam at a steep discount through September 23. Fallen Order is 75% off, bringing it down to just $10, and Survivor is 80% off, taking it down to $14. The deluxe version of Survivor is only 70% off, but that still makes it just $26. Both of these games are a bargain at those prices, especially considering they're among the best games in the Star Wars franchise, at least in my opinion. If you enjoy soulslikes, it's definitely worth giving Fallen Order a try. It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire. While Jedi: Survivor isn't perfect, and had a rocky start at launch, it has a solid story and…",

Everyone is being so goddamn annoying . Last Thursday, with Steam buckling and Silksong on everybody's lips, I was at the nadir of my excitement, predicting a sea of perfect 10s that would look embarrassing in a year's time. It seemed like it could be one of those games where, once everything dies down, the consensus becomes \"Yeah, it was pretty good, but we all got way too worked up about it.\" The Bioshock: Infinite special. I didn't always feel sour about the collective Silksanity or its quirky outflows⁠—I still have to put some respect on the commitment of Daily Silksong News , a worthy successor to the Daily Elden Ring Update ⁠—but the final crescendo of excitement, memes, and (worst of all) discourse just chafed my hams: Silksong's hype and anticipation had entered the realm of the absurd or parodical, a performance carried out on Reddit for th…",

Like most sensible people, I long ago wrote off the Postal series as an idea that started terribly, enjoyed some fleeting glory in the same wave of cultural disaffection that brought us Limp Bizkit and the Attitude Era, and has spent the decades since thrashing around in search of relevance. Yet several times over the last few years, I've heard furtive whispers from various corners of the internet that there is one Postal game which is actually, genuinely good. No, I'm not referring to Postal 2 , which despite inexplicably having the same Steam rating as Half-Life 2 , is a pretty shoddy game.

But the adorable trailer for Neville's upcoming physics platformer has got me wondering whether I'm somehow missing out. Wirm belongs to the same floppy family of games as Bennett Foddy's QWOP and Getting Over It , a 2D adventure about bypassing obstacles in a form ill-suited to navigating rough terrain. Yet where Foddy's games have an emphasis on challenge, Wirm appears to adopt a gentler approach—more about the low-key joys of being a worm than getting your ass kicked as one. Wirm furnishes you with the full powers of a limbless invertebrate. Your peristaltic locomotion allows you to crawl over most obstacles, and those which cannot be overcome may be, er, undercome by digging through surrounding soil. Finally, you'll be able to embrace that most commonly understood annelid ability—flying through space. I'm not joking. The trailer for Wirm mainly depicts said worm travelling t…",

      "body": "Sucker Punch is best known on PC for its open-world samurai game Ghost of Tsushima and its upcoming sequel Ghost of Yōtei —which will almost certainly come to PC given Sony's track record in recent years. Yet before it became the architect of lavish Japanese islands, Sucker Punch developed the Infamous games for Sony, and before that , it was known mainly for Sly Cooper. A likeable, if unremarkable, series of stealth action games starring an anthropomorphic raccoon, Sly Cooper had its heyday in the PS2 era. It was last seen in 2013 in a game not developed by Sucker Punch. Despite being more than 20 years and two series out from its Sly Cooper days, there are fans who still hope Sucker Punch will return to the game that put the studio on the map. But Ghost of Yotei co-director Nate Fox poured cold water on such optimism, as hardly anybody employed at Sucker Punch would be interested in reviving Sly Cooper. In an interview with MinnMax (via GamesRadar ) Fox was asked by host Ben Hanson what percentage of Sucker Punch devs would be up for making a new Sly Cooper game, to which Fox instantly responded \"ten percent\". Hanson was slightly taken aback, so Fox clarified that \"It's been a l…",

The original game, which released way back in 2011, boiled down the infamous complexity of the genre into a more accessible turn-based strategy, focussing primarily on tactical manoeuvres and managing supply lines rather than any base building or faffing around with economics. The sequel ingeniously expands and elaborates upon this simple premise, resulting in one of the best strategy games you can play today, and you can get it right now for a tactically sound 85% off. Unity of Command 2 is based upon the same ideas as the original, all about defeating enemy armies using clever positioning and thinking ahead. Your units' attack power is governed not just by their equipment or experience, but their locations relative to the landscape and both friendly and enemy units, as well as their connection to your army's supply lines. Indeed, the supply mechanic sits right at the heart of Unity of Command, dictating your units' ability to function. If an enemy captures one of your supply depots, it will inhibit units' ability to attack and, eventually, move at all. Likewise, if you can sneak behind an enemy frontline a…",

Tainted Grail's unusual world and intriguing questlines more than made up for a few rough edges, as Sam Desatoff explained in his Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon review . \"Every NPC has something worthwhile to contribute, and most of them offer side quests that add new wrinkles to the larger story,\" he wrote back in June. \"They can also be surprisingly funny: you'll help a nobleman fake his death to get out of a loveless marriage, uncover the lair of an undead chef chasing the next great meal, assist a woman who accidentally turned her husband into a pig, and more.\" Questline has updated Tainted Grail sporadically since launch. But the latest patch— v1.1 —is by far the biggest yet. Not only does it squash a vast array of bugs nibbling at the RPG's underbelly, but it also adds several major features and a bunch of new locations for players to explore. The headline update is a New Game Plus mode, which resets the game …",

The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta. In a recent interview with IGN , console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said changes are coming in the final game. \"We definitely reduced the range and overall reduced the power,\" Nickerson said. \"We found out a lot in open beta that it was obviously very strong, just like players said. Really, players ended up just shooting Doritos. Light environments, dark environments—they were just like, ‘Hey, aim at the Dorito.

The studio stands accused of taking a very cool new armor set, which had been intended to be a reward from the returning Iron Banner activity, and instead placing it inside the Eververse Store where it sells for 1,500 Silver per character—$15 in real money. The shambles goes back to September 9, when the Destiny 2 team announced the return of the Iron Banner PvP mode, \"with new weapons to earn and an incredibly cool new set of armor .\" A couple days later, though, Bungie unveiled the new Iron Banner armor and it was in fact \"reprised\" armor , which is to say a reskin of old armor—and not an especially impressive one in the eyes of Destiny 2 fashionistas.

I'm just not sure we deserve that peace. Part of me thinks that the bespoke Claptrap slider doesn't go far enough—that we should instead be given a Claptrap equivalent of an arachnophobia mode, replacing him wit…",

It's not exactly been smooth sailing for 2K Games and Gearbox Software, the publishers and developers, as the game's overall performance is rougher than the Drake Passage. To help matters (or make things worse, depending on your point of view), 2K produced a detailed chart of what settings Nvidia GPU owners should use to get the best performance. However, most of this just involved enabling upscaling and frame generation. Borderlands 4 is just plain hard on your hardware. Especially the CPU, it would seem, because the minimum system requirements demand an '8 core (or equivalent)' processor, citing an Intel Core i7 9700 as an example. Yesterday, I tested a very similar chip , the 9700K, in a rig with a Radeon RX 5700 XT and 1080p Low quality, and the CPU was frequently hitting 100% utilisation in the open world (see below). But what if your gaming PC has a processor with fewer cores, a Core i5 or a Ryzen 5 chip, for example? Does that mean you're going to be in trouble? To find out, I've spent the day running a series of tests on two gaming PCs, where I've decreased the num…",

You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay. It was kinda fun: I played a few runs, unlocked some upgrades, and experienced brief whiplash after locking eyes with two headlines about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real.

In the letter [ PDF warning ], Senator Wyden reveals that an investigation his office conducted into a ransomware breach of healthcare provide Ascension last year found that support of the RC4 encryption cipher was a direct contributor to the attack (via Ars Technica ). “Because of dangerous software engineering decisions by Microsoft, which the company has largely hidden from its corporate and government customers, a single individual at a hospital or other organization clicking on the wrong link can quickly result in an organization-wide ransomware infection,” said Wyden. \"Microsoft has utterly failed to stop or even slow down the scourge of ransomware enabled by its dangerous software.\" RC4, or Rivest Cipher 4 , was developed in 1987 by mathematician and cryptographer Ron Rivest, and was considered a protected method of encryption un…",

No, not a giant middle finger etched into the sandy ground by the Chinese military—though you could see why that might happen—rather, a SpaceX Starlink satellite speeding through the frame. WorldView Legion had papped a Starlink satellite as it sped by in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)—an incredibly rare occurrence. The satellite is seen in the image a few times: the darker image is the satellite, and the three fun new colourways are sadly nothing more than artifacts from the imaging process. \"The rainbow effect you see is called a pan-sharpening spectral artifact,\" Susanne Hake, SVP and GM, USG, Maxar Intelligence says in a LinkedIn post (via Space ). \"Essentially, our imaging system was merging high-resolution black & white data with color data while the Starlink zipped past at orbital velocity.

If you hadn't clocked it, this all involves the Green Prince—a mysterious grasshopper (he might be a cricket…) you can rescue in Sinner's Road. Visiting Verdania is related to his overall journey. Obviously, this guide will contain some spoilers for the Act 3 main quest (as far as having to progress it to reach Verdania is concerned), so leave now if you're not there yet.

Preservation often means knocking on the same doors again and again, hearing 'no' most of the time, until one day, it's finally a 'yes.'\" That paid off with GOG eventually getting to re-release a handful of Japanese games that were difficult to get hold of in the west like Silent Hill 4: The Room, some of the early Metal Gears, and the OG Castlevanias and Contras. Capcom eventually agreed to let GOG re-release Dino Crisis and the first three Resident Evils, though it took \"time, persistence, and trust-building,\" Gnyp says. A re-release of Breath of Fire 4 earlier this year was one of the stand-outs of GOG's preservation initiative launched in late 2024 . \"Working with Japanese partners often requires demonstrating both technical capability and …",

Because of this, Gearbox made the baffling decision to remove the traditional minimap in favour of a compass at the top of the screen. Sure, the compass is useful for getting your bearings, but it's also completely useless in pinpointing enemies in combat. There's a psycho to your northeast, but they could be standing right in front of you or ten blocks away. See what I mean? Luckily, tucked away at the bottom of the 'gameplay' tab in the settings menu is the radar display . This isn't quite the minimap of old, which would give you the exact layout of the area, but it will help you track the exact location of enemies in combat relative to your own position.

You may recall that previous Borderlands games on Steam were review-bombed earlier this year because of changes in their EULAs. There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players. It was all a bit (or a lot) overblown, as PC Gamer's Tyler Colp pointed out: \"a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything.\" Those review bombings did indeed have little impact…",

There's even a pretty active subreddit dedicated to the idea : the main rule is that you're not allowed to post about games that are under a year old.
