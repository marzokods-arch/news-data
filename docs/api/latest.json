(Ok, we got Oblivion Remastered last year, but leftovers, however well warmed up, don't count). The Arthurian-flavoured open-world RPG recently surpassed one million copies sold, proving, if proof was ever needed, there's still a big hunger for Skyrim -style experiences.

      "body": "أكد الكرواتي كرونسلاف يورتشيتش المدير الفني لفريق بيراميدز المصري قوة وصعوبة مواجهة نهضة بركان المغربي في دوري أبطال أفريقيا غداً الأحد. وقال مدرب بيراميدز في مؤتمر صحفي اليوم السبت: \"نلعب ضد نهضة بركان للمرة الثالثة في حدود ثلاثة أشهر ما يجعل الفريقين بمثابة الكتاب المفتوح لكلا المدربين واللاعبين وهو ما يجعل المواجهة الثالثة صعبة وقوية\". وأوضح أنه يعلم جيدا مدى صعوبة المباراة خاصة أن المنافس قوي ويمتلك لاعبين وجهاز فني مميز، وبالطبع المواجهة بين بطلي دوري الأبطال والكونفدرالية تحمل الكثير من الصعوبة. وتابع: \"ينخل المواجهة وهدفه الفوز وحصد الثلاث نقاط من أجل حسم بطاقة التأهل للدور المقبل، وفض الشراكة مع بركان على صدارة المجموعة\". وأشار إلى أن المواجهة صعبة والأخطاء غير مقبولة حتى لا يخسر كل منهما ثلاث نقاط تجعل موقفه في التأهل صعبا، ولكن هذا لا يعني شيئا بالنسبة لبيراميدز الذي سيدخل اللقاء وهدفه الفوز وحسم بطاقة التأهل رغم الضغط الذي يلعب فيه بيراميدز محليا وقاريا. وأضاف:\" يبدو أن هناك من لا يرغب في أن يفوز بيراميدز ببطولات العام الماضي والتي تحققت مؤخرا، وبات طرد يورتشيتش هو الهدف الرئيسي لأي حكم حتى وإن كان الاعتراض منطقيا على قرار الحكم وهو ما ظهر جليا في كل المباريات الأخيرة وتحديدا في الدوري\".",

But Project: Gorgon doesn't solely riff on the rules of the past. It has ideas of its own, such as an NPC relationship system and dynamic environmental systems that let players solve problems like being set on fire by jumping into a lake. Its main attraction though, is a deep, open-ended skill system that enables players to tailor their approach to combat.

While I did manage to get all of the Terraria pals eventually, it only worked after I generated new worlds. ⚒️ Updates in-progress While I've found all the pals, I'm still testing which strategies you can use to find them most reliably. If you find one under different conditions that I can reproduce, I'll add it here! Since writing this just days after the update's launch, I've spent my nights testing theories and praying over Water Candle buffs. Cattiva is the \"easy\" part, while Foxparks had me rethinking why I signed up for this journey. The others were less hassle, but after browsing Reddit, Discord, and Terraria's forums for clues, it seems I'm not the only person feeling ill over pal spawn rates. I can tell you how to get the Terraria pals using the same setup that led me to success, but keep in mind the spawns aren't guaranteed immediately. You'll have to create those same conditions, then hope for a little RNG mercy. How to get all of the Terraria…",

But which is better, watching Markiplier play the game for 45 minutes on YouTube or watching the 2+ hour adaptation he directs and stars in? I decided to watch both yesterday—including a follow-up video where he spent 30 minutes replaying Iron Lung—meaning I submerged myself in more than three entire hours of Markiplier in a single day. No, I'm not a hero, I'd just rather stare at a screen than do any real work. Iron Lung , if you haven't played it yourself, is a first-person horror sim where you're sealed inside a tiny submarine and submerged in an ocean of blood on an alien planet. Using minimalist controls, you steer your windowless sub around taking pictures of whatever is lurking in the bloody depths while getting progressively more scared and paranoid. It's a great game.

Use TF2 pre-release inspired weapons like the Nail Gun, the Dynamite Pack, and the Tranquilizer Gun, all redesigned from the ground up to feel right at home with what's already there.

It's set on a tantalizingly weird ring world populated with grimy medieval Witcher NPC types who will have daily schedules⁠—and a procedural vengeance system if you wrong them. I had to stop playing 1v1 PvP in Armored Core 6 because it was a detriment to my health: The knife's edge, million miles an hour duels filled me with so much adrenaline I'd have trouble sleeping if I played too late in the evening. Other games⁠—and for a few minutes right after playing, real life⁠—would feel so slow I had trouble adjusting. The new demo for indie RPG Sword Hero made me feel the same exhilaration and \"nothing can compare\" spoiling, but in singleplayer. Videogame combat so good, it might be a problem. To my editor reading this: I promise I got work done yesterday, but when I sat down for Sword Hero's updated Tournament demo for \"just a few rounds to see what's new,\" it became the rest of my work day and much of my evening.

Right now we're coming to the end of the mid-season transfer window, where clubs have the opportunity to buy and sell players, and amidst the incessant speculation one of the league's top managers felt the need to remind the football media that the beautiful game is not, in fact, a videogame. The moment arrived during a press conference featuring Tottenham Hotspur manager Thomas Frank, a Danish coach whose witty asides are not quite papering over the fact that the club is having a terrible season. Frank took over in June last year from Ange Postecoglou, a garrulously amusing Australian who committed the cardinal sin of winning something with Spurs and was promptly sacked. Nevertheless the North London club remain one of the biggest around, and one of the players it's been heavily linked to over this transfer window was Antoine Semenyo. Semenyo instead chose to join Manchester City for £62.5m and, while Tottenham have made other signings, Frank was asked to address losing out on one of the club's main targets. \"It was clear, there is no doubt, that the cl…",

Also unsurprisingly, given his competing store and past criticism of Steam, Sweeney approves of the action, and based on his related legal tussles with Apple and Google, thinks there's something to it. The lawsuit, filed in 2024, very broadly alleges that Valve unfairly prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms and requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices for UK consumers. Valve had argued that the suit should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—but a Competition Appeal Tribunal disagreed, ruling earlier this week that the suit can proceed. Sweeney has homed in on the DLC issue specifically. Although developers can sell DLC on other platforms and have it carry over to a user's Steam copy, Valve doesn't allow them to sell add-ons directly through in-game stores or to use th…",

And now, it's even going as far as to characterise itself as helping build a \"rebel alliance\" against Big Tech. The company has released an animation- and graphic-heavy roadmap and report , which in many ways reads like a very dramatic vision statement about how it can challenge the way that AI is developing at the hands of Big Tech. It's kind of bonkers, but in a way that I can't help but get on board with. \"What if a rebel alliance of sorts—developers, activists, researchers, founders, investors—joined forces to build something different?\" It envisions that this alliance will \"push AI in a direction that is trustworthy, human-centered and shaped by all of us.\" Which I suppose explains the focus on turning Firefox into an \"AI browser.\" Regarding this, Mozilla does clarify that its vision for Firefox is one of …",

If Kinetic Games' latest roadmap stays on track, then we'll be cutting it close, as Phasmophobia is planning for its 1.0 launch with a horror rework and lore update sometime this year. It's a big year for Phas as the horror rework and lore updates coupled with 1.0's debut are one of several major patches outlined. There's also a Unity 6 and network update on the roadmap that I hope will fix some of the frustrating connection issues I occasionally run into, and the long-awaited player character overhaul launches soon. I'm stoked to finally show up to the function (hopefully) not wearing the same thing as three of my friends. And by wearing the same thing, I mean all playing as the exact same guy with no way of knowing who's who. Anyway, as is Phasmophobia tradition, the Kinetic team is pretty hush-hush about the finer details around big patch plans, keeping things scarier for all of us come launch day. So, for a little extra roadmap context, I've scraped together a bit of what we do know and…",

If you feel the same, it sounds like a great time to dive into Fallout 76 because it's completely free to play from now until February 5, which will carry you through to the Fallout Season 2 finale next week. If you want to wear that dope NCR power armor from the show in Fallout 76, though—that ain't free. That ain't even close to free. The Fallout 76 Mojave Bundle , which includes that tasty NCR armor skin, a Legion Legate outfit, an NCR flag and neon New Vegas sign, a fancy lookin' new super sledge, and a few other odds and ends, will run you $30 USD.

This year, 52% of the more than 2,300 respondents said that they \"think generative AI is having a negative impact on the game industry,\" according to the report's author, Beth Elderkin, who notes that just 18% said the same thing two years ago, and 30% last year. The opposite opinion, that generative AI is good for the industry, was only found in 7% of this year's respondents, a decline from 13% last year. The people least likely to approve of generative AI are who you'd expect: artists, designers, writers, and programmers. The people who use AI the most are also who you'd expect. Ever since CEOs started hyping the technology as a productivity elixir, skeptics have suspected that the executive class is more likely to personally rely on chatbots, and GDC's survey results are consistent with that hypothesis. \"Business professionals' usage (58%) far out…",

A promised crackdown on so-called \"illegal immigrants\" by US president Donald Trump has become a violent free-for-all resulting in multiple killings that the government and security forces have insisted were justified, despite sometimes ample evidence to the contrary. Some countries over the past year have issued travel advisories or cautions for people headed to the US: Canada, for instance, issued a warning in 2025 that anyone with a gender-neutral passport could face difficulty entering the country because of an executive order signed by Trump directing the government to recognize only two \"sexes,\" male and female. The US is also home to a large number of developer conferences and events, and that leaves developers with a tough choice: Put themselves at risk of detention or worse, or miss out on potentially vital opportunities for networking and promotion, which can be particularly important for smaller indie devs. Despite the high cost missing these events can incur, GDC's 2026 State of the Game Industry survey indicates that nearly one-third of industry employees who don't live in the US have cance…",

The survey results indicate that widespread layoffs remain a persistent issue in the games industry, having intensified during the transition into the post-pandemic era and the fallout of industry expansion and acquisition.

We only get one shot at this,\" a goggled Sam Fisher says in a recognizably Metal Gear Solid call screen. We then see a neck-down shot of Solid Snake skulking through a cloud of smoke, unholstering what appears to be a SOCOM pistol with an unusual sight. The man himself doesn't speak, but he appears to be wearing a sneaking suit similar to this MGS2 look. The teaser ends with the date and time of the full Year 11 roadmap reveal: February 15 at 8AM PT. Some obvious questions arise, such as: Huh? Collaborations are nothing new for Rainbow Six where cosmetics are concerned, but this is the first time a playable operator has come from outside the Tom Clancyverse.

And across all runs, there will now be corrupted regions on the map that you can choose to pass through, facing harder enemies but earning stronger rewards in the process.

VK Dual Blades (Image credit: Bandai Namco) You can buy the VK Dual Blades from Jadwiga's Minion merchant on the southwest coast of MagMell Island for 1,000 Haze The VK Dual Blades is the best weapon I've found at the start of the game, in part because it synergises perfectly with Noah's blood code, which boosts Dexterity and damage with successive hits. You can also grab a free Dexterity booster from one of Jadwiga's Minions in the gear upgrade room of MagMell, too.

It's been going from strength to strength, thanks to continual Proton updates, attention garnered from the Legion Go S and the upcoming Steam Machine, and as of today, even official Nvidia GeForce Now support . And now it's getting the active and single-minded focus of a conglomeration of different Linux distributions. It comes in the form of the Open Gaming Collective (OGC) , a group formed, at least in part, of developers for various and somewhat disparate gaming-oriented Linux distros. Developers of these distros, such as those working on Bazzite, Nobara, Asus Linux, PikaOS, and many more, will work together to \"a unified set of gaming-focused components used across the Linux ecosystem\" (via GamingOnLinux ). The various distros represented aren't all built on the same base OS, either; Nobara and Bazzite, for instance, are Fedora-based, while PikaOS is Debian-based, and ChimeraOS is Arch-based. Ubuntu, the most popular and well-known Linux distribution, is Debian-based, but Fedora tends to be a popular base for gaming distros, and Arch is what the Steam Deck's SteamOS is bui…",

Someone is probably going to nail the freemium critter game combo soon, but after playing in its current closed beta test I just don't think Aniimo is the one.

Gacha catch 'em all In Aniimo you're the Pathfinder, a fresh-faced recruit headed down to the continent Idyll to collect aniimos for reasons that I forgot even as they were being explained to me in a cutscene. Are any of us internalizing the story in gacha games anymore? Dramatic motivation aside, you've got to explore Idyll, catch the aniimos you find wandering its biomes, \"twine\" to transform into them and use their skills to solve small open world puzzles, and occasionally battle it out with high level world boss aniimos in real-time combat.

After spending a week with a pre-release build of Destiny of the Railforged , my enthusiasm is renewed. Though the DLC doesn't touch every aspect of Monster Train 2 (there are no new Alcove events, for example), it's a substantial package that makes an already large experience feel supersized. Also there's a card that lets you grab units—friendly or enemy—with a giant claw and move them to another floor, which feels cool as hell. Yoink .
