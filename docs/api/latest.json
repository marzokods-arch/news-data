The big day is this Thursday, November 20 at 8am PST / 11am EST / 4pm GMT / 5pm CEST , when the show will reveal its 26 winners in a gala ceremony going out across YouTube , Twitch , Steam , Facebook , TikTok and X as well as Future Games Show , GamesRadar , PC Gamer , WhatCulture Gaming , Ginx TV , Bilibili and Niconico. In other words, it's everywhere. You could probably have it telegrammed to you live if you insisted on it. After 43 years in the awards biz, this year's Golden Joysticks hit a new record in terms of votes cast. Over 21 million people made their voices heard when it comes to the ceremony's many categories. Can 21 million people be wrong? Well, it depends on whether they gave GOTY to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 or not. Maggie Robertson isn't the only star studded in this year's cast. 2025's Golden Joysticks guest prese…",

This week I've been: trying to survive the Raider and Arc packed perils of Stella Montis. I love shouting \"Don't shoot\" in Stella Montis in solo—it's like Raider radar. You'll hear one person reply from the balcony above you, another from the next room over, one in a nearby vent, and a final one you didn't even realise was standing behind a pillar nearby. Arc Raiders ' new Stella Montis map is cramped , especially after the big sprawling open areas of Dam Battlegrounds, Spaceport, and Blue Gate that we've grown accustomed to since launch. That's partly what makes it so distinct, though. Stella Montis's confined corridors and snaking tunnels, packed to the gills with Arc enemies and other Raiders, make for a unique brand of chaos. It's a space for players who love the excitement of interaction and conflict.

Arc Raiders Matriarch spawn locations Image 1 of 2 Dam Battlegrounds (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 Spaceport (Image credit: Embark) Like the Queen during the Harvester event, you'll only encounter the Matriarch during the Matriarch event map condition . You'll know when this is active, as you'll see the modifier before picking a map on the main menu, and again when you load into the match. It's worth noting that the Matriarch event spawns on normal map nodes, not a separate node like the Night Raids and Electromagnetic Storm. Once you're in the match with the event active, you'll need to search the following location for the Matriarch, depending on the map: Dam Battlegrounds: The Breach area of the dam, …",

Well, they said it was a lot of stuff to do with the endings and your choices across the series not mattering that much. I know better, though. In their heart of hearts, in the deep, festering reaches of their collective subconscious, the gamers yearned for the lifts. The first Mass Effect was beloved. It was also a game about standing in a lot of lifts. These things are not unconnected. Now, a doughty modder has restored the third Mass Effect (in its Legendary Edition form) to the pristine condition of its predecessor. Glorious Elevators (LE3) comes from Linkenski, who also put in the work to restore the original setup for ME1's Saren fights to the Legendary Edition and created, ah, Miranda Buttfarts Restored . \"Glorious Elevators return to Mass Effect beyond the first game,\" declares our modder. \"Originally Mass Effect 3 actually had a working elevator right …",

Still, as temperatures drop, and heating bills soar, you can't blame a girl for wanting to get a bit creative about heating her space—though I think I'd have to draw the line at welcoming a mini data centre into my home. Well, according to the BBC , that's one of the options being offered as part of a pilot scheme in the UK. As part of the project, participants Terrence and Lesley Bridges replaced their gas boiler with the mini data centre in question and claim their bills have dropped from £375 a month (almost $500) to only £40 a month (about $50). The kicker? The data centre, which comprises 500 teeny tiny Raspberry Pi computers, is still compact enough to fit inside their outdoor shed. Terrence Bridges is pleased with the swap, citing both the savings made and the device's impressive heat output… as well as another line of reasoning that personally gives me pause. He told the BBC, \"I think it's fantastic because it's eco-friendly. We're not burning any gases, so it's green—it's environmentally friendly.\" Cal…",

So far, we haven't seen any dramatic increases in PC system prices, but as Black Friday 2025 hoves into view, the question is for how much longer will that remain the case? Trendforce recently downgraded its expectations for 2025 from 1.7% growth for the overall PC market to -2.4% shrinkage. For smartphones, Trendforce revised its figures from 0.1% down to -2%. According to Hankyung, memory accounts for 25% of the cost of AI PCs and 18% of the cost of smartphones. Trendforce reportedly expects laptop prices to rise by five to 15% on account of the 75% increase in RAM module prices that we've already seen. Presumably if memory prices go yet higher, retail system prices will follow. Hankyung also notes that the price of 16 Gb DDR5 chips more than doubled to $24.80 per unit in the month to November 18 on DRAMeXchange . In response, bigger players in the IT industry including Asus and Apple are said to be preemptively purchasing DRAM (and also NAND memory for SSDs), while also discontinuing low-margin products.…",

But the developer's most ambitious game is probably Heaven's Vault , a sci-fi archaeological adventure about piecing together an ancient alien language. Phillippa Warr gave it an impressive score of 88 in PC Gamer's Heaven's Vault Review, stating it \"does a beautiful job of letting you unlock a language, and thus a dialogue of sorts, with the past, via a wonderfully engaging protagonist.\" Yet had Inkle's original plans come to fruition, Heaven's Vault would have been quite a different experience. This was revealed in a Bluesky post by Inkle's narrative director and writer Jon Ingold, where he stated that \"Heaven's Vault started out as a Doctor Who game\". Ingold revealed the full story in an interview with Eurogamer , explaining how Inkle was approached by multiple organisations about working with their licenses following the success of 80 Days . \"One of those was an approach from the BBC, who floated several different BBC properties for us to consider working on. As a lifetime Doctor Who fan, that was the one we jumped on.\" Inkle then spent roughly eight months working on a pitch called The Daedalus Ef…",

After listening to him suck up to Elon Musk on the Rushmore podcast (cheers TWIV ), however, it sounds like he might have lost his strong instincts. \"Elon truly would be the best owner of any game company,\" he said. \"No, he would. There's not a person who'd be more qualified to build and run a game company.\" Musk's videogame credentials largely amount to liking videogames. He might actually be quite good at Quake and Diablo 4 , too, though it's really hard to tell given his penchant for paying people to play for him. In January, he streamed some Path of Exile 2, but seemed confused by basic game mechanics, which would have been fine if he hadn't been boasting about his skills, or if he wasn't playing on a geared-up, high-level character.

I received the View 390 Air in its white variant for review. This being called 'Snow' and offering a suitably frosty finish across most parts of the case. Though there are a few colourways to choose from, including a delectable-sounding Butter Caramel (yellow) and, my personal favourite, Future Dusk (purple). Or just plain black if you're a bit boring. Upon opening the box, I had a feeling I might end up a little disappointed with the View 390 Air. The case doesn't make a good first impression, in large part thanks to the bag of loose screws hanging in the rear. This, I dare say, is the messiest bag of bolts ever called 'accessories' I've experienced with a PC case—a jangling selection of screws, zip-ties, and a roll of Velcro, looking like the world's worst party favour.

And they only had 30 employees at the company.\" Kotick didn't want to have to take the reins. \"We can't run your company,\" he told Notch.

Revealed in the Vendetta hero trailer , La Lupa shows off a couple of cool tricks that'll likely be part of her kit. While fighting a huge omnic in the Colosseo in front of a rowdy crowd, La Lupa uses her giant sword to take it down. She has a spin attack that launches an energy projectile, pierces its husk with a charged-up sword, and performs what looks like an ultimate as she cuts the omnic in half with a huge energy slash. But most of her attacks are melee, meaning this'll likely be her primary attack. Vendetta is unfortunately a DPS hero, which is great for DPS players who want another melee hero to master, but I'm still convinced that she should've been a Tank . Heroes like Junker Queen and Doomfist have already proved that tanks don't necessarily need to be huge or have shields, as long as they can make and hold space, and it seems like La Lupa would be able to do this.

As part of the event, each player has access to a mini battle pass where they can earn rewards via XP gathered from runs . There are quite a few items to be had in this event, but the best by far is the Deadline mine. It first caught my eye as it is a pink, epic rarity item, but I hadn't paid it any more attention until I saw just how effective it is against arcs. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Over the last few days, I've seen videos of this mine one-shot a Bastion , kill a Leaper, and be integral in the fight against the Queen arc. It's truly the best item in the game right now for killing arcs. YouTuber Damood brought eight Deadline mines to his fight against the Queen arc and, alongside the help of other raiders and the electromagnetic cloak, managed to use them to take the Queen down in under 10 minutes, an impressive feat. While another player, LifelessOne, decided to see what would happen if they put a Deadline on a Leaper: \"The new mine is… strong.\" I'm just impressed they ma…",

However, the days of this vastly preferable third option may be numbered. US states Wisconsin and Michigan have already proposed VPN crackdown bills aiming to close off this workaround—and the UK may be looking to follow suit . Online privacy nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation recently criticised this strategy, taking aim at Wisconsin's bill in particular, saying that blocking the use of VPNs is \"going to be a disaster for everyone.\" The foundation argues that due to lawmakers misunderstanding how the location-masking technology works, \"Websites subject to this proposed law are left with this choice: either cease operation in Wisconsin, or block all VPN users, everywhere, just to avoid legal liability in the state.

      "body": "OLED PC monitor sales are on the up, according to data outfit Trendforce . Compared to last year, sales are up by fully 65%. That's comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the same period in 2024. If you instead put this quarter up against the previous quarter in 2025, sales of OLED monitors are up 12%, with a grand total of 644,000 units. Trendforce is predicting 2.62 million units, total, for 2025 and over 80% growth versus 2024. For context, another analyst firm, IDC, is forecasting over 130 million overall PC monitor sales of all types for 2025 and around 25 million specifically gaming monitor sales this year. That latter figure is probably the most relevant. Currently, the vast majority of OLED monitors are aimed at gaming, with just a handful of models either engineered for content creation and other professional use or the premium consumer segment. That means OLED is predicted to have roughly 10% of the PC gaming monitor market in 2025. Incidentally, if you're wondering who the big noises in OLED monitors are, according to Trendforce, Asus has taken over the top spot from Samsung, with 21.9% market share in its latest figures. OLED TVs still make monitors seem pricey. (Ima…",

That's my takeaway from recent remarks by Jacob Navok, former director of business at Square Enix and current CEO at Genvid—a media company specialising in \"a unique mix of a streaming show and video game\"—on X (via GamesRadar ). Navok reckons that, for as much as people like me bang on about AI being the labour-sucking death of art, \"it appears consumers generally do not care\" when the tech manifests in their games. To be fair, he's got receipts. Navok summons the recent examples of Arc Raiders and the Roblox game Steal a Brainrot to back up his points. Arc Raiders, of course, makes prominent use of AI voices, which did little to stop it peaking at 480,000 concurrent players last weekend. Steal a Brainrot, meanwhile, \"had 30m concurrents or approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents,\" says Navok, \"and is named after/based on AI slop characters. (All the brainrots are just 3D models of AI slop.) \"Gen Z loves AI slop, does not care. The upcoming generation of gamers are Bane in Dark Knight Rises saying, 'You merely adopted the…",

Nevertheless, it's here in the control room in the east of Power Generation Complex that I made a miraculous discovery: the locked door I've walked past so many times doesn't require a unique keycard like every other door does. It turns out you need to slot a Power Rod into the door to crack it open. Yes, the Power Rod isn't just a crafting material; it's technically a key, too.

The post also says that \"recipients can use their Epic Rewards balance to redeem gifts\"—an odd phrasing that makes it sound like you'll need to use Reward points to redeem a gift you've been given. However, in the longer Gift FAQ, Epic clarifies that \"you can use your Epic Rewards balance toward a gift purchase\" which makes a lot more sense. As for what you can gift friends on Epic, the answer is most items on the store, but not everything. The exceptions are free games (for obvious reasons) pre-purchase offers, subscriptions, and in-game currency or other consumable items. Anyone who receives a gift on Epic has 14 days to claim it, somewhat shorter than the 30 days allowed by Steam.

Turns out, yes, yes they are, and not just in the obvious ways. I'm going to be getting into spoilers for Dispatch's ending , here. You've been warned. As discovered on the game's subreddit by user zero-sumgames (who collated the info, alongside u/serversamwinchester and u/bog_waif ), whether or not Invisigal stays a hero or becomes a villain is dependent on a modifier in the game's code called the \"RobertMentorCounter\" system, or RMC. Essentially, this hidden value will have Invisigal become a hero and take a bullet for Robert if it's high, or have her become a villain and kill Shroud if it's low: \"Your RMC is affected through story decisions, succeeding in story-related hacking events, and the barfight QTE's. All of which are detailed here. However, your RMC is also affected by Dispatching.\" That is to say, while your choices as R…",

Heineman was 62, and the GoFundMe will remain live to help her family make final arrangements. Born in 1963, Heineman initially made a mark on the industry by winning a national Space Invaders tournament in 1980 in New York, becoming the first formally recognized US champion of any videogame. She went on to have a far-reaching career, being credited on 67 games according to MobyGames . Heineman co-founded Interplay in 1983 alongside Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell. The developer and publisher was the source of many foundational PC games, including Wasteland, Fallout, and Baldur's Gate. Heineman designed and programmed a number of games at Interplay, with her most prominent design credit being The Bard's Tale 3: Thief of Fate. Heineman's friend and colleague from Interplay, Brian Fargo, shared a remembrance of the developer on X. \"Rebecca Heineman sadly passed a…",

And yet, here we all are again, charging down the field with renewed gusto following Valve's big hardware announcements . Given how many times we've ended up flat on our backs behind an unkicked football, I cringe to say this, but it's not unreasonable to believe that a new Half-Life game will be announced within the next year or so. The recent excitement on the Half-Life subreddit is partially due to misunderstandings (reporter Jason Schreier does not in fact have insider information about an imminent announcement), but is at least somewhat justified by the facts: The idea that Valve might release a new Half-Life game is no longer in the realm of pure imagination, as it put out the VR-only Half-Life: Alyx in 2020 The Half-Life: Alyx ending (spoilers) very much leaves the door open for future Half-Life games Five years is enough time to have made a new Half-Life game (although barely,…",

Some crash and burn on day one while others are kept alive by players, modders, and community creators long after they might have otherwise slipped away. A few games, however, have lived on for decades, kept alive not just by passionate fans but by developers who have never thrown in the towel or dusted off their hands and said \"done.\" These games have, against all odds, managed to withstand the test of time. They're still being worked on after 20, 30, even 40(!) years. When we first wrote a version of this list in 2018, all of the games we included had been updated that year. Amazingly, seven years later they're all still alive, even if updates are a bit fewer and farther between. But almost every entry on this updated list has either been updated in 2025, or in the last couple years, with its development history making us pretty sure they'll still see another patch in the second half of this decade.

I love it so much. Demon King producer Andy Han got me in touch with Daifuku so I could find out how you make a game that sounds like literal hell. The answer, it seems, is some incredibly creative (and occasionally painful) sample work. \"Making the sounds was basically just layering, spectrally morphing and manipulating samples until I found something I thought sounded cool,\" Daifuku said. \"Most of the sounds I made were simply happy accidents, such as the Nure-onna gasping before she feeds, which was me accidentally eating very stale banana chips.\" Unfortunately, the exact scene Daifuku is referencing is not on YouTube, but I'm pretty sure you can hear the gasp in question (followed by some stomach-churning slurping) at the 57-second mark of this trailer for Labyrinth of the Demon King. \"I thought…",

      "body": "A pre-trial brief filed by lawyers representing the ousted former heads of Subnautica 2 studio Unknown Worlds alleges that Krafton CEO Changham Kim was \"desperate\" to avoid paying them the bonuses required by their acquisition contract because of the \"professional embarrassment\" that would result from the perception that he overpaid for the studio. The filing claims Kim went so far as to consult with AI to figure a way out of paying, but even ChatGPT told him he was probably stuck. The legal dispute between Krafton and Subnautica designer and director Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire has been dragging on since July, when all three very suddenly left their positions . While the departures were initially presented as amicable, it quickly became clear that it was anything but. Legal action was filed by both sides and it's gotten very messy: Krafton initially said the three were fired because of the state of Subnautica 2 and their insistence on releasing it before it was ready, but in September it seemed to drop that claim in favor of focusing on allegations the founders had \"deceived\" Krafton , including that they'd downloaded confidential informatio…",

This, along with it being WoW's 21st anniversary, is probably why Blizzard decided now is a good time to drop that $90 mount again. That's right—the $90 dinosaur mount is back. Notorious for showing up right after a controversial balance patch last year , the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur has been released from its cage and it might be the reason WoW Tokens are currently sold out in the UK. The mount was extraordinarily popular last time. Players were crowding the streets with it, which led some other players to despair as this absurdly priced microtransaction seemingly got more attention than a botched patch. That's not exactly the case this time, but there are still people who hate that it even exists. Most of the fervor for the dinosaur mount is because it comes with an auction house and mailbox attached to it, unlike almost every other mount in the game. The only other option costs 5 million gold. In a world as big as WoW, it pays to ha…",

While Clair Obscur might be boasting the most nominations, it'll still have to outvote the likes of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and the sheer cultural force of Hollow Knight: Silksong.

The problem is they keep getting cancelled before anyone gets to see them. \"People often ask me why I don't make a sequel to Nier, or why I'm not working, but that's because I've had so many projects that have been discontinued lately,\" Yoko said via machine translation. \"Even though I was working, it wasn't released to the public. I'm getting paid, so it's not a problem for me personally, but because my output isn't being released to the public, people see me as not working.\" While that's particularly disappointing for anyone hoping for more Yoko Taro-brand weirdness, the Nier creator is just one of many game developers who've recently had to watch their work evaporate. 2025 has continued a years-long rash of game cancellations, studio closures, …",

Joseph O'Connor, now 26 years old, hijacked over 130 accounts, including those of Apple, Uber, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Kanye West. Alongside other hackers, three of whom have been charged, they then impersonated the companies / individuals in question and used the accounts to promote a classic \"double your money\" scam. The hijacked accounts would send tweets asking followers to send Bitcoin to digital wallets, promising that the money would be doubled and returned. An estimated 350 million Twitter users viewed these dodgy tweets and, over 15-16 July 2020, a total of 426 transfers totalling 12.86 Bitcoin was made to the wallets. This would have been worth around $110,000 in 2020: now the value would be more like $1.2 million. The hack itself, as they often are, was more down to social engineering than cyber genius.

The third is Virtualization-based Security (VBS), which is used to keep vital parts of Windows (like the kernel) in an isolated environment.
