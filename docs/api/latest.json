A series of patches and U-turns have tried to soften the abrasive edges of the Portal's design—aimed at reducing the absurd power grind as well as making buildcrafting feel less restrictive and punishing. Still, these felt like temporary stopgaps—desperate attempts to staunch the bleed that didn't address the root issues at the heart of the new design. In a blog post last night, Bungie finally laid it all out: \"With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game.

Researchers in Japan believe they have cracked the problem, though, by developing a GPU-powered active noise cancellation system that's powerful enough to calm an entire room. That's according to NTT Laboratories , as reported by PC Watch . It claims to have developed the \"world's first spatial active noise control (spatial ANC) technology.\" Active noise cancellation (ANC) certainly isn't new, and many readers will probably own a gaming headset that sports the feature. What makes NTT's tech different is a combination of the speed of the sound processing and how it can be applied. Headphones with ANC use microphones to pick up nearby sounds, which are then sent to a small signal processor. This calculates the appropriate 'anti-phase' sounds to generate, which are then emitted via the speakers. The original noise and new sounds overlap and partly cancel each other out, greatly reducing the impact of the noise.…",

If you're just using a light shield, then repairs aren't an issue at all, as all you need are regular plastic parts. But if you have a medium shield it'll cost much more. Repairing a medium shield costs requires arc circuitry and one battery. Now, the battery isn't exactly a precious resource, but the arc circuitry is. I only have seven lying around in my inventory right now, and if your shield is damaged below 50% you'll need two of these to repair it.

Nonetheless, new data from Mercury Research shows that, despite the frosty reaction towards these chips from the PC hardware community at large, it doesn't appear to have made as much of a dent in Intel's desktop market share as you might expect. MR reports that Intel's slice of the desktop CPU market is 4.9% lower in the third quarter of this year, compared to Q3 2025. So, despite AMD having had a relatively bumper year for desktop CPUs, it still trails behind Intel with 33.6% of the market share.

This little device shoots out drones that chase down enemies and explode. And when I say chase, I mean it; these drones don't complain about having to travel halfway across the map to find a target. If that sounds incredibly annoying to play against, then you're spot on. They're easy enough to shoot, sure, but you're wasting ammo shooting them out of the sky (don't forget how long reloading takes), and they're the perfect distraction. While the drones are unlikely to score many kills (it requires two to hit a target to bag a kill), having one damage an enemy you're fighting is more than enough to seal the deal. It's basically an easy way to soften up the enemy or get them to fire their gun, wasting their ammo or even revealing them on the map if they're not using a suppressor.

It feels like any given RPG these days has to do the post-launch tango of bug fixes and tweaks to address all those crashes that slipped through the cracks. Being bigger and more ambitious than its predecessor didn't save the retrofuturistic RPG any trouble, if this week's patch is any indication: it packs a wallop of over 350 fixes by my count. There's not much sexy to talk about—no new goodies, no balance changes that'll induce tears of joy—instead, it's death by a thousand cuts, if death was an improved game and cuts were small adjustments. For instance, the Bomb Suit armor had an issue where it reduced explosive damage dealt rather than taken; that little quirk should be addressed now, saving any grenade enjoyers further perplexity. The whole list can be found in a blog post on Obsidian's website , and while there are a shedload of minute changes, there are some highlights. Companions are tankier overall now, \"especially on Hard and Very Hard difficulty settings,\" and party members like Tristan and Inez should no longer have a \"wants to talk\" icon when they aren't meant to.

Whether directly, indirectly, tangentially, or just plain pointlessly. So, thank you Valve, for offering up three new pieces of Steam hardware this week that made not one mention of the initialism de jour: AI. The closest we got was when its engineers noted the Steam Machine was being targeted for 4K60 gaming, but only via the use of upscaling. Even then, it's an AMD-based system, and FSR has only just got itself updated to machine learning algorithms with the FSR 4 update. That, however, is still effectively tied to the Radeon RX 9000-series of graphics cards, and most definitely not available to the Navi 33 GPU at the heart of the Steam Machine's discrete GPU.

Starting with the joint venture between Adata and MSI , a new DDR5 module is set to appear on the market that is certainly going to be snapped up by anyone who needs as much RAM as possible in their PCs, without sacrificing performance. AMD and Intel's latest top-end desktop platforms (i.e. X870E and Z890) support up to 256 GB of RAM. However, to reach this amount, you normally have to buy four 64 GB DIMMs, filling every slot on the motherboard. When you do that, you're typically forced to use the memory's lowest speed (e.g. 4800 MT/s), which isn't ideal for something like high-resolution video editing. The answer to this is Adata and MSI's 4-rank DDR5 modules. Where most DIMMs have just one or two ranks of memory, these sticks will be so loaded with DRAM modules that each one will offer up to 128 GB of capacity. Not only that, they'll be rated to run…",

This mission is a four-parter where Tian Wen asks you to investigate two specific locations in the facility and deliver two items to her, one rare and one epic. It's a tall order, to be honest. Since grabbing both items in this quest is primarily based on RNG, I'd suggest you bring a safe pocket with which to store either should you strike lucky. Despite having good loot, Stella Montis feels like a pretty friendly map at the moment, as players fight through so many Arc that they barely have time to kill each other. All that said, here's how to complete Snap and Salvage in Arc Raiders. Take a photo of any of the Rovers in the Sandbox You can find the Rovers in the Sandbox area on the bottom layer of Stella Montis (Image credit: Embark Studios) This first step is very easy to complete. Simply head to the lower layer of Stella Montis and find the Sandbox near the center of the map—you might have to zoom in for it to appear.

For those unaware, if you have a video file in the right resolution and format, SteamOS allows you to use it as a boot screen—it can be anything you choose. And naturally, people have already got to work on boot screens tailored to the upcoming Steam Machine. In particular, this GabeCube one posted by Redditor DentureTaco will surely be a go-to. The 'GabeCube' meme is already a little overused but frankly, I don't care. It's too good not to use, and this faux GameCube animation is fantastic. That staple Valve audio at the end sends nostalgic shivers down my spine, too.

Spurred on by Eurogamer's fascinating, polarising Arc Raiders review (penned by PC Gamer contributor Rick Lane), Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani gave his take on the game's use of AI, the broader discussion surrounding the technology, and how it relates to Helldivers 2. Speaking on The Game Business Show , Jorjani tries to find the middle ground, even though Helldivers 2 doesn't use generative AI or machine learning. \"We're waiting for the courts to decide what is fair use and not,\" he says. \"There may be some similarities to the whole 'It's so over, we're so back' black and white takes, and I find that anything that is AI related debate in the games industry ends up being on both ends of the spectrum. \"Either we have Square Enix executives talking about 77% [ the actual number it gave was 70% ] being automated through QA, or we have developers who feel that their livelihood or the very fabric of their being is being threatened, and therefore all AI is bad AI.

Then charge $299 (AUD $499). It's a confident swing in a space dominated by Razer, SteelSeries, and Logitech, and for the most part, the Cloud Alpha 2 connects—if you actually need that base station. Battery life remains the headline. HyperX's previous Cloud Alpha Wireless —a long‑standing PC Gamer favorite for best wireless gaming headset until Razer took top honors— pulls a ludicrous 300 hours. The Cloud Alpha 2 Wireless, however, dials that back to a quoted 250. On paper it's a downgrade, but in real use it still feels like witchcraft. I gamed nightly, took Teams calls, and ran music on Bluetooth without ever thinking about the HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 Wireless ' battery. Even with both radios active, it never died. I still haven't charged it since unboxing. \"Charge it once a month and forget about it\" still applies, and it keeps HyperX well ahead of rivals tapping out after around 40–70 hours. The new…",

It's packed with a beefier processor, higher-capacity RAM, and a better Wi-Fi chip than Meta's top device, the Meta Quest 3 , and this all makes me think Valve has the guts to step into the ring with the company previously known as Facebook. This is before mentioning that Valve seems to have a bit of a hidden blade up its sleeve in the form of an included USB dongle that connects to a specially sectioned antenna in the headset for wireless streaming. This, combined with foveated streaming , means that the headset can pick up on where you're looking, focus all of the higher quality juice into that section, and render everything at a lower quality. And that's not the only selling point for the Steam Frame. Valve's Lawrence Yang told us it \"represents a fundamental shift in the way that we look at VR.\" For the first time, SteamOS is on an Arm chip in the Frame. It can wirelessly connect to your rig to play your VR games, but also play non-VR games through the same controllers. It's all hitting the right notes for me. However, in my excitement for the new headset, I spotted a single note in the specs sheet that dampens it somewhat: Mono …",

That brings us to this Vulcan II TKL , a full-size, tenkeyless board whose design and feature list will be like putting on comfy old shoes to anyone who tried the previous Vulcan, and whose Titan HS mechanical switches offer a really distinctive, linear sensation. Appraising gaming keyboards right now is tough, because it's become extremely specialised. Manufacturers are broadening their ranges to cater to as many preferred tactile sensations as possible, and weighing one up against another really does involve a lot of personal preference. That said, there are a few empirical factors like build quality that help the plight of poor, put-upon reviews like myself. In this case, the Vulcan II TKL makes a great first impression.

With plenty of details on what's inside this machine, and Valve's tactics for the Steam Deck , we have most of the information we need to take an educated guess at the price. We don't know anything more than we've already said in our various stories on Valve's Linux box. We're simply piecing together our expectations, Valve's history, the specs, and some amount of vibes-based optimism from the team—a large amount of vibes-based optimism from the team. I've tallied up an average from our guesses—or those of us brave enough to actually take a guess—and it's around $525. That's notwithstanding the difference between the smaller 512 GB model and the much larger 2 TB model, however, which may well cost in excess of $100 more based on today's Steam Deck OLED pricing.

Unless you have some creative friends by your side. Last night PC Gamer's strategic director Evan Lahti was playing Arc Raiders with his squad when he came across a very convenient hack. If one of your squad members places themself right in the corner of the door and another raider jumps on their head, then it'll clip them through the locked door. Once the person who clipped inside can then open the door to let the rest of their squad inside. And then voila, you can all get some high-level loot without the hassle of bringing in a key card.

After the not small upfront cost of building your very first rig, there's the regular rhythm of pricey hardware upgrades (to say nothing at all about the cost of repairs and replacement parts). So, could the Steam Machine corner the market of folks curious about the power and customisability of PC gaming, but who still want to hit the ground running when it comes to gaming? Given that the bog-standard PS5 now costs $550 and the price of a 1TB Xbox X has climbed…",

Existing chip export restrictions preventing Nvidia from selling its top-end hardware to China remain, but The Wall Street Journal claims it has traced how 32 Nvidia GB 200 server racks, containing 2,300 Blackwell chips, made their way to China via an Indonesian company—eventually ending up in the hands of a Chinese AI tech provider. According to the WSJ, the chips were bought from Nvidia by Silicon Valley-based AI server manufacturer Aivres , which operates under a parent company that is one-third-owned by Inspur, a Chinese company that was added to the US government's trade blacklist in 2023, over claims that it worked on Chinese military supercomputing projects. Aivres went on to sell the 32 Nvidia GB200 server racks to an Indonesian telecoms company, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison , the WSJ claims, for around $100 million. According to its sources, Indosat bought the servers after securing Shang…",

Whether that's using the environment to throw yourself into space , or various items in ways they're not really meant to be used in, I'm always impressed with just how quickly everyone else seems to find these loopholes. With that being said, Peak's newest patch update has decided to encourage players to continue doing this by buffing one of the game's most exploited items - the Scout Cannon. These updates mean the Scout Cannon can now launch zombies, which is perfect for anyone struggling to make their way through the Roots biome. The weight of the item has also been reduced from six to four, which is pretty huge news, as one of the sole reasons I don't carry it around is because of how heavy it is and how much stamina I lose when doing so. Outside of this, some smaller tweaks like making the cannon easier to jump out of and the forced ragdoll time being reduced have been made, too. With the reintroduction of the Scout Cannon glitch, I genuinely fear for the power speedrunners now have when it comes to reaching the Peak. However, outside of these significant Scout Cannon buffs, an issue the game has…",

The two characters shown in the reveal are an axolotl and a frog, and much like every other critter you can pick as your playable character, you'll still be able to customise them with the colour palettes you've unlocked while exploring the island. Which is fantastic news as it'll take a lot for me to change my current pastel pink bunny.

As a result, Requiem is already looking very different to its two immediate predecessors: instead of seedy backwaters and toothless hicks, the footage we've seen thus far takes place in the claustrophobic environs of faceless high rises and labyrinthine halls. In that sense, it's quite reminiscent of Resident Evil 2. During a chat with Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa, I noted the shared DNA in Resident Evil 4 and Village, and asked if Requiem might have a similar relationship with any older entry in the series. He confirmed my theory with no hesitation: \"I believe in that regard, it's very close to Resident Evil 2,\" he said. Aside from the setting, Requiem also has a stronger focus on the qualities of its player-character than the last two instalments. Sure, Ethan Winters had a backstory, a personality, and a very pressing motive, but Kumazawa makes an interesting distinction between Ethan and Requiem's new protagonist Grace Ashcroft, who is extremely vulnerable and unused to confrontation or violence. \"When you look at Res…",

The Wake of the Water update arrived this week, bringing a new high-level biome to the already massive Embervale map. Veilwater Basin is a tropical jungle filled with lakes, waterways, and sunken ruins to explore, and the region is also perfect for building a new base because you can put all that water to use. Since Enshrouded's water is simulated in real time, you can dig canals for irrigating crops or powering new crafting stations, and you can move water around in containers to fill your own lakes and ponds. There are even waterproof walls included in the update if you want to build an underwater base—and something tells me you do. Just be careful: if you remove the wrong block down there, water will immediately begin flooding your submerged home. You're not the only one moving into Veilwater Basin. A lizard-like race called Drak are also elbowing their way into the region, and not only are they strong swimmers but they can use weapons underwater—unlike you. You might w…",

The ex Geralt never properly ended things with, and the canon love interest as book readers will tell you (it's me, I'm book readers), she complicates Geralt's love life and forces him to belatedly grow up—which feels thematically appropriate, as he retakes his place as Ciri's father figure over the course of the game. Yet that element wasn't always part of The Witcher 3. As Badowski says, \"It wasn't [there] from the beginning, but at some point we understood that this lack of kind of conflict, personal conflict—of course, there's Ciri—but there was a lack of something .\" As soon as someone suggested the idea of making players c…",

The company plans to drop over 130 billion won ($88 million) into the project, recently stopped hiring new employees, and started a voluntary resignation program for its employees in South Korea this week. Far down the ladder from these decisions is Eleventh Hour Games, the developer behind Last Epoch, which Krafton acquired in July . The timing couldn't have been worse as it happened right after the founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds were unceremoniously fired for what they claim was a move to avoid paying a $250 million earnout. At the time, EHG founder Judd Cobler told fans of the budding action RPG that having a corporate owner would only benefit the game in the long run by giving them access to more resources and employees. Fans of the game were understandably skeptical about how the buyout would impact the game. That skepticism turned into outright worry when Last Epoch's first expansion, Orobyss, was announced during a Sony State of Play in September. Ever since the Last Epoch Kickstarter in 2018, EHG promised that once you buy the game, everything…",

The series started out great. It gave the stale and yet seemingly never-ending Alien saga something it really needed: a kick in the butt. Instead of just one Alien, it gave us a bunch of different types of aliens, including a weird eyeball creature that is both horrifying and yet kinda cuddly? Instead of a single android, standard for Alien movies, it also featured a cyborg and several synthetic people with human minds transplanted into them. And instead of a xenomorph slowly picking off people one by one from the shadows, this big alien boi was just right out there in broad daylight, mass-murdering entire groups of people in mere seconds like a buzzsaw.
