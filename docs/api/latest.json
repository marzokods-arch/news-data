Every other game seems to support larking around for up to four people. And in the increasingly unlikely event that a game doesn't have co-op to begin with, chances are someone will make a version of it that does. Such is the case with Keep Digging , which lifts the premise of DoubleBee's surprise hit A Game About Digging A Hole , er, wholesale, opens up its shovelling shenanigans for up to eight players, then rests its hard hat over its eyes for a wee nap while the cash rolls in. Like DoubleBee's burrowing sim, Keep Digging sees players break ground using basic tools like spades and pickaxes, which they use to unearth valuable ores and treasures. These can be sold to purchase more advanced equipment like dynamite, wire rope, and batteries. I presume the latter are used to power some other excavation device, but the Steam page just reads \"batteries\" so it isn't clear.

No, the reason for their familiarity is far more interesting: a good chunk of the game's score includes rearranged songs from my favourite PC rhythm game. Welcome to Soundtrack Sunday, where a member of the PC Gamer team takes a look at a soundtrack from one of their favourite games—or a broader look at videogame music as a whole—offering a little backstory and recommendations for tracks you should be adding to your playlist. Neowiz is also the studio behind the DJMax series—starting off as an Asia-exclusive online PC game before moseying off to PlayStation for a number of years, finally returning to desktops in 2020's DJMax Respect V. The game's music library is chock full of tracks, from original pieces to collaborations with other games like League of Legends and Tekken. There's K-pop, metal, hip-hop—if there's a song genre, there's a good chance DJMax has a composer for it.…",

BI's biggest and best milsim to date has kept players satisfied for more than a decade, mainly thanks to its thriving and endlessly creative community, though a host of DLC has helped too. If you haven't braved Arma 3's hyper realistic battlefields, now might be the time to do so. The game is currently 90% off, making it cheaper than a cup of coffee. The discount is part of Bohemia Interactive's Steam publisher sale , which has most of the Czech studio's cheaper than usual. Arma 3 for $3 (£2.50) is by far the best deal of the bunch, though. The single-player campaign, which was released over a period of three years, is pretty strong. But really it's the multiplayer where Arma 3 is at. Whether you're playing ops with friends, building your own scenarios, or getting involved with RP servers like Arma life , it has tons of different experiences to offer. If you want to go all-in, you can get Arma 3 plus all its key DLC for less than the RRP of the base game. While most of…",

The signature Camera Obscura mechanic, used to capture and fend off spirits, remains a key feature, now offering richer and more engaging gameplay in both exploration and combat. In addition, the new 'Holding Hands with Mayu' mechanic adds a heartfelt touch, letting you experience the deep bond between the sisters like never before.\" While two later games in the series, Maiden of Black Water and Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, have made it to PC previously, this is the first time one of the well-received original trilogy will be officially represented on our platform of choice.

This season's new team are the Vampires, definitely one for veteran players. Their most powerful skill is Hypnotic Gaze, which lets them strip opponents of their tackle zones and prevent them using skills like block and dodge. It works on a 2+, rather than 3+ under the old rules in Blood Bowl 2, though it's modified by -1 for each marking player. Hypnotic Gaze is a great way of bypassing blockers and busting cages, but it's balanced by the Bloodlust rule. Every bloodsucker has to pass a test before they act, and if they fail they bite someone else on your team—which is why the handful of useful vampire players have to be bulked out with a mob of thralls who exist just to be snacked on. Playing as the Vampires can be infuriating, as a few bad Bloodlust rolls will see you injuring your own players faster than your opponent can (there's no armor roll for your thralls when they get bit).

Producer Roy Lee didn't reveal much about the film, but hinted at a potentially lengthy wait: \"Well, 'The Long Walk' became a reality because 'BioShock' was delayed for a little bit where we had to do some more script work. And so as the script work is being done, we shot 'The Long Walk,' and [Francis Lawrence] was already committed to doing the next 'Hunger Games' movie. And so it's just waiting for him whenever the 'Hunger Games' is completed, and the script is just being worked on right now.\" Lee was referring to Sunrise on the Reaping, a Hunger Games prequel focusing on Haymitch Abernathy's Games. It began filming this summer and is set to release on November 20, 2026. Francis Lawrence directed all four of the previous Hunger Games films, so it's no surprise he returned for this one. Unfortunately for BioShock fans, that means Lawrence has his hands full for the time being. Filming for a movie like Sunrise on the Reaping can take …",

It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire.

I didn't always feel sour about the collective Silksanity or its quirky outflows⁠—I still have to put some respect on the commitment of Daily Silksong News , a worthy successor to the Daily Elden Ring Update ⁠—but the final crescendo of excitement, memes, and (worst of all) discourse just chafed my hams: Silksong's hype and anticipation had entered the realm of the absurd or parodical, a performance carried out on Reddit for th…",

Like most sensible people, I long ago wrote off the Postal series as an idea that started terribly, enjoyed some fleeting glory in the same wave of cultural disaffection that brought us Limp Bizkit and the Attitude Era, and has spent the decades since thrashing around in search of relevance. Yet several times over the last few years, I've heard furtive whispers from various corners of the internet that there is one Postal game which is actually, genuinely good. No, I'm not referring to Postal 2 , which despite inexplicably having the same Steam rating as Half-Life 2 , is a pretty shoddy game. Its open world may have been ahead of the curve back in 2003, but even when I first played it as a socially awkward 15-year-old (the primary audience for Postal games) I could see through the fountains of blood and voluminous arcs …",

But the adorable trailer for Neville's upcoming physics platformer has got me wondering whether I'm somehow missing out. Wirm belongs to the same floppy family of games as Bennett Foddy's QWOP and Getting Over It , a 2D adventure about bypassing obstacles in a form ill-suited to navigating rough terrain. Yet where Foddy's games have an emphasis on challenge, Wirm appears to adopt a gentler approach—more about the low-key joys of being a worm than getting your ass kicked as one. Wirm furnishes you with the full powers of a limbless invertebrate. Your peristaltic locomotion allows you to crawl over most obstacles, and those which cannot be overcome may be, er, undercome by digging through surrounding soil. Finally, you'll be able to embrace that most commonly understood annelid ability—flying through space. I'm not joking. The trailer for Wirm mainly depicts said worm travelling t…",

A likeable, if unremarkable, series of stealth action games starring an anthropomorphic raccoon, Sly Cooper had its heyday in the PS2 era. It was last seen in 2013 in a game not developed by Sucker Punch. Despite being more than 20 years and two series out from its Sly Cooper days, there are fans who still hope Sucker Punch will return to the game that put the studio on the map. But Ghost of Yotei co-director Nate Fox poured cold water on such optimism, as hardly anybody employed at Sucker Punch would be interested in reviving Sly Cooper. In an interview with MinnMax (via GamesRadar ) Fox was asked by host Ben Hanson what percentage of Sucker Punch devs would be up for making a new Sly Cooper game, to which Fox instantly responded \"ten percent\". Hanson was slightly taken aback, so Fox clarified that \"It's been a l…",

The sequel ingeniously expands and elaborates upon this simple premise, resulting in one of the best strategy games you can play today, and you can get it right now for a tactically sound 85% off. Unity of Command 2 is based upon the same ideas as the original, all about defeating enemy armies using clever positioning and thinking ahead. Your units' attack power is governed not just by their equipment or experience, but their locations relative to the landscape and both friendly and enemy units, as well as their connection to your army's supply lines. Indeed, the supply mechanic sits right at the heart of Unity of Command, dictating your units' ability to function. If an enemy captures one of your supply depots, it will inhibit units' ability to attack and, eventually, move at all. Likewise, if you can sneak behind an enemy frontline a…",

But the latest patch— v1.1 —is by far the biggest yet. Not only does it squash a vast array of bugs nibbling at the RPG's underbelly, but it also adds several major features and a bunch of new locations for players to explore.

The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta. In a recent interview with IGN , console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said changes are coming in the final game. \"We definitely reduced the range and overall reduced the power,\" Nickerson said. \"We found out a lot in open beta that it was obviously very strong, just like players said. Really, players ended up just shooting Doritos. Light environments, dark environments—they were just like, ‘Hey, aim at the Dorito.

The studio stands accused of taking a very cool new armor set, which had been intended to be a reward from the returning Iron Banner activity, and instead placing it inside the Eververse Store where it sells for 1,500 Silver per character—$15 in real money. The shambles goes back to September 9, when the Destiny 2 team announced the return of the Iron Banner PvP mode, \"with new weapons to earn and an incredibly cool new set of armor .\" A couple days later, though, Bungie unveiled the new Iron Banner armor and it was in fact \"reprised\" armor , which is to say a reskin of old armor—and not an especially impressive one in the eyes of Destiny 2 fashionistas.

Initial critical response was fairly positive, but some sites— including PC Gamer —didn't receive pre-release code and were unable to offer their own opinions at launch. And once the clock hit go time, early Steam reviews were dominated by reports of performance issues and crashes that we experienced in our own early performance analysis . While it looks like Borderlands 4 still has a few kinks to hammer out, it does serve up one of the better features we've seen in the series: A chance to finally, mercifully silence Claptrap—and only Claptrap. (Image credit: 2K) Yes, Borderlands 4 has a volume slider specifically for its flagship failure robot, letting you completely mute the shrieks, shouts, and general insufferability Claptrap has forced us to endure since 2009. Technically, this isn't the freshest news: Some had noticed the slider during prerelease demos . But it's about time. Society has evolved beyond the need for Claptrap. I'm just not sure we deserve that peace. Part of me thinks that the bespoke Claptrap slider doesn't go far enough—that we should instead be given a Claptrap equivalent of an arachnophobia mode, replacing him wit…",

JUPITER itself is built around 50 container modules over a 2,300 square meter site, and contains a simply astonishing amount of hardware . The Booster module contains roughly 6,000 nodes, over which 24,000 Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips are interconnected via the company's Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking system, complete with a slew of Arm-based CPU cores, 288 per node. The Cluster module, interlinked with Booster, is made up of more than 1300 nodes containing a wealth of Rhea1 processors, another Arm instruction set chip and designed by SiPearl. Each cluster node has two of these chips, with each containing 80 Arm Neoverse Zeus cores.

You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay. It was kinda fun: I played a few runs, unlocked some upgrades, and experienced brief whiplash after locking eyes with two headlines about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real.

WorldView Legion had papped a Starlink satellite as it sped by in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)—an incredibly rare occurrence. The satellite is seen in the image a few times: the darker image is the satellite, and the three fun new colourways are sadly nothing more than artifacts from the imaging process. \"The rainbow effect you see is called a pan-sharpening spectral artifact,\" Susanne Hake, SVP and GM, USG, Maxar Intelligence says in a LinkedIn post (via Space ). \"Essentially, our imaging system was merging high-resolution black & white data with color data while the Starlink zipped past at orbital velocity. Physics turned a technical imaging challenge into accidental art.\" WorldView Legion is a \"constellation\" of six imaging satellites, flying at 518 km. The first two launched in May 2024, with the final two only joining later in February 2025. So it wasn'…",

      "body": "Finding a way to Verdania in Hollow Knight: Silksong is kinda confusing. It's definitely one of the most complex regions to reach, especially as I'm pretty sure it's entirely optional. First off, actually visiting it requires you to unlock Act 3 , which is a whole elaborate process in itself. You'll also have to complete some additional unrelated steps before that. If you hadn't clocked it, this all involves the Green Prince—a mysterious grasshopper (he might be a cricket…) you can rescue in Sinner's Road. Visiting Verdania is related to his overall journey. Obviously, this guide will contain some spoilers for the Act 3 main quest (as far as having to progress it to reach Verdania is concerned), so leave now if you're not there yet. Otherwise, here's how to unlock Verdania as an area and help the Green Prince. How to unlock Verdania in Silksong As mentioned above, you can't get to Verdania until you're in Act 3 , and even then, you'll have to jump through some hoops first. I suggest doing these first three stages during Act 2, because I can't 100% confirm you still can in Act 3.

Actually, I'm pretty sure you didn't miss it, because your newsfeeds are now likely full of positive reviews for the game itself, but a seemingly equal amount of backlash towards its poor performance. The game currently sits at a \"Mixed\" rating on Steam , with the chief complaint from players being the performance and early game crashing issues. Publisher 2K Games has since updated the Steam community page with several optimised settings charts from Nvidia, but they make for unhappy reading. Maximum Frame Gen (2x for RTX 40-series owners, 4x for RTX 50-series cards), DLSS cranked to the guns—even the mighty RTX 5080 , a $1,000+ GPU, appears to need a hefty dose of both to achieve 60 fps+ at 1440p resolution.
