It's gone down a storm with Terraria' community, but there is one aspect to the update that players will have to wait a little longer for—mod compatibility. This is because Terraria's mod support relies heavily on tModLoader , an open-source addon that facilitates both creating and playing mods. It's an enormously popular tool, with a user-base that rivals some of the biggest games. But as with many mod projects, the 1.4.5 update has produced compatibility issues that will take some time to fix. This was explained by tModLoader's creators in a Steam post . \"We know everyone is looking forward to tModLoader and mods having access to all of the new content and features as well,\" the modders wrote earlier this week. \"We'd like to remind users that updating tModLoader to major Terraria releases is a huge undertaking.\" For context, the modders pointed out that it took nine months to update tModLo…",

Now though, as the developer gnaws through the last few items on its to-do list, it has formally revealed when the game will depart early access, and it's happening in March. Announcing the date in a Steam post , Mechanistry also showed off the game's intro cinematic, which it has temporarily redubbed as a \"lore trailer\". I query this title, not only because lore isn't generally foregrounded in this manner, but also because the arc of the trailer is \"some beavers cross a desert and then start building a city,\" which is not exactly deep worldbuilding. It is a nicely animated video, though, with some supremely gravelly narration from British actor Shaun Dooley. As Mechanistry notes in the post, Timberborn has come a long way since its debut into early access in 2021. Previous updates have introduced water pumps , robotic beavers and hazardous polluted water , alongside whole new transportation methods such as ziplines and water tubes.

Hide in Bushes is a real \"does what it says on the tin\" mod that makes you 50% harder to detect when you crouch in a bush, with a lower percentage bonus for smaller shrubs, and makes you 10% harder to detect when you crouch near a tree or stump. The reason this mod didn't exist until now is that it needed the Object Impact Framework mod first. Object Impact Framework flags a bunch of Skyrim's objects that previously had limited interaction so they can be activated in new ways. Want to be able to set fire to strong alcohol ? Or extinguish torches ? First you need Object Impact Framework. Now those bushes and trees count as …",

It's a frequently updated mod—last time we checked it restored a bunch of dialogue , including a Yennefer romance scene—but the most recent update is particularly substantial. The lengthy list of additions in version 3.1.0 includes the note: \"Restored a completely new plotline - Shani's fate during Hearts of Stone expansion. Features a new ending for the expansion (optional).\" As shown by YouTube's exhaustive Witcher 3 documenter xLetalis in the video above, this plotline helps explain why Shani returns in the Hearts of Stone expansion. At one point in development her life would have been at stake if you crossed the expansion's villain Gaunter O'Dimm. The restored scenes use dialogue found in the game files, which suggests this plotline was cut quite late in development, but everything else has been made from scratch. It's incredible how well it fits, with everything from camera angles to character animations and lip-sync up to the standard of the rest of the game. That said, I'm not particularly fussed this storyline was cut. The conclusion, in which your local version of Lucifer …",

Her escape route leads to a demonstration of a hot-air balloon, the same model the Montgolfier brothers used just nine years previous in the first manned balloon flight. Of course, she jumps in. It's your job to cut the ropes while fighting off the first wave of pursuers. It's a perfect setup for the kind of over-the-top pseudo-historical hijinks the Assassin's Creed games specialize in.

If you're a videogame enjoyer of a certain tenure, you'll even remember the BioShock movie. Not the new one Netflix is developing, but the old one that got killed before it ever reached the finish line. It was set to be directed by Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Rango, and the American version of The Ring.

It's become a bit of a running joke in the Final Fantasy 14 community that the MMO will never get Blitzball, with the game's director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) playfully scolding players during Dawntrail's pre-release when talking about Gold Saucer updates. Well, jokes on him, because Blitzball's actually alive and well in FF14. I have been to a match (big up the Buccaneers), cheered in a crowd, and even gotten myself a special novelty hat, all without a single lick of game code actually dedicated to it. The Etheirys Blitzball League (also known as the EBL) is a roleplay community that hosts and runs in-game tournaments of the fantasy sport. After attending a game, I simply had to see how it was done—and as it turns out, Blitzball has an entire rules document dedicated to it, one that's over 140 slides long.

But I'm not here to talk about Mario. I'm here to talk about Yoshi. Yoshi, Baby Mario's foster father and adult Mario's horse, is the headlining new character in the Super Mario Galaxy movie, which appears to be a neverending tapestry of references for theater-attending videogame players to point at and whisper, \"I remember that guy\" to their spouses and/or parents. The new teaser Illumination put out yesterday is packed with visuals and characters from Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart, Mario Sunshine, and the titular Galaxy. What's notable about this teaser is that Yoshi does that thing that he does. He gobbles up Kamek the Magikoopa in slow-motion with a flick of his tongue and then poops him out, his glasses comically intact over the fresh egg.

It's an idle clicker rather than a 3D physics puzzler, and the relationship it depicts between humans and geese is far less antagonistic than in House House's game.

There's a Baldur's Gate TV show coming, headed up by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl and The Last of Us fame. That's either great news or terrible news depending on which precise Larian developer you are , but either way it's a significant enough occasion to warrant marking, if you ask me. I decided to mark it with a quiz. But which quiz? We've had BG3 quizzes before, and the game is so dog-eared from repeat playthroughs by fans that it's difficult to come up with something truly challenging. Then it hit me: gnomes. Gnomes are great; they're literally just weird little guys, and BG3's gnome characters are some of its finest. So here it is: the definitive, be-all and end-all quiz about the gnomes of Baldur's Gate 3. Warning: it's actually quite hard.",

Well, it achieved the seemingly impossible, improving upon X-COM: Enemy Unknown . Firaxis' refinement of Julian Gollop's groundbreaking original seemed like a perfect distillation, retaining the essence of what made Gollop's game great—the tension, the heartbreak, that feeling of squaring off against overwhelming odds—while also ironing out many of the kinks present in that original design. But then along came XCOM 2. Firaxis' sequel upped the ante from defending Earth from alien invasion to liberating it from alien occupation, recasting your organisation as a scrappy guerilla unit fighting a totalitarian regime from within.

When you move out, though, all bets are off, and you can tell everyone who lives nearby exactly how you feel. And I've never seen a moving out message sent quite so spectacularly as by Rust player and reddit user UniverseBear, who constructed a giant, illuminated middle finger to say sayonara to his server buddies. As seen in UniverseBear's reddit post , the flashing flip-off is emblazoned on the side of a rectangular tower built from corrugated iron and concrete. The offending gesture itself is constructed from industrial lights timed to cycle through an animation where the middle finger slowly raises from a clenched fist. It seems this is something of a tradition for UniverseBear, a way to cap off a round of Rust when the server is due to be wiped. \"Making one of these is often how I like to end a successful wipe,\" he wrote, before detailing how exactl…",

Sci-fi Shooters 2.0 is a two-tiered bundle, and there's good reasons to shoot for either of them. Paying the minimum price of $14 (£12.51) will net you four games, namely Doom Eternal . Prey: Digital Deluxe Edition , Black Mesa , and FPS roguelite Battle Shapers . I'm not hugely familiar with Battle Shapers, but the other three games are, in my opinion, must-play experiences. Doom Eternal is still the best single-player FPS you can play today, a spellbinding iteration of id Software's 2016 Doom reboot that rewards mastery of its rich combat system in a manner unlike anything I've played before or since. Even last year's Doom: The Dark Ages , which I enjoyed very much, cannot compete with the ferocious pace and intensity of Eternal's combat.

In The Outer Worlds 2, which I finally got around to playing this week after hearing great things , I don't feel like a real person while moving around. I feel like a camera, perfectly hovering in place and magically stabilized as I plop one foot in front of the other. It's as if Adam Jensen installed gimbals in his eyeballs. I'm talking about headbob : the subtle camera movement of first-person games that mimics the body's natural bob as it walks or runs. Headbob is so established and omnipresent in first-person games that it's rare we have an occasion to acknowledge it. When headbob comes up, it's usually because a game has too much of it. The Outer Worlds 2 has no headbob. Zero , unless you're sprinting. Your neck is totally detached from the motion of your body, and it's driving me up the wall.

Anthropic's adverts criticise ads being introduced to ChatGPT, and describe it as a \"betrayal\" of users. I regret to inform you all that the irony metre has officially smashed. It has gone off the scale. First thing to say is, the ads are also good: I'd recommend watching one or two first, while thinking about OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's face the first time he saw them. To take one example, embedded above, an AI user asks a bot (a middle-aged woman, in the ad) how to communicate better with his mother. When he asks what to do if the advice doesn't work out, the \"AI\" recommends a site for dating mature women where \"cubs\" can find \"cougars.\" Each ad ends with the same sting: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\" As if it couldn't get better, this is backed by the refrain from Dr Dre's What's the Difference, which goes \"What's the difference between me and you?\" Look, I know it's marketing, I know they've \"won\" by ge…",

At least, that's what ransomware is supposed to be. Recently, a new one has been spotted that couldn't be removed even if the hackers wanted to. Nitrogen's ESXi ransomware, as spotted by Coveware (via The Register ), has a \"coding mistake in the ESXi malware [that] causes it to encrypt all the files with the wrong public key, irrevocably corrupting them.\" Effectively, once ransomware gets into your device (often via suspicious links or PC vulnerabilities), it then encrypts your valuable files and stores a randomly generated key that only it knows. That key can then be used to decrypt files. It's like someone who spots you removing your lock from a locker and putting theirs on instead. Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back. Coveware points out that when the public key is accessed, the ransomware mistakenly overwrites the first four bytes of the key, which means \"no one actually knows the private key that goes with the corrupted public key.\"…",

For example, I only got three skill points when I reset last time, but instead of $2 million, I now only have to pay $600k for the remaining two. In fact, $2 million would get me those old skill points and two of the second Expedition ones as well.

      "body": "While id Software's rebooted Doom got me reaching for my Super Shotgun with suitably psychotic glee, I never warmed to Doom: Eternal . I know that for many gamers, it delivered the hyperfast bullet ballet they'd always wanted, but for me, it simply felt that far too much of Doom's DNA had been sacrificed in order to deliver it. Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed. A more grounded (literally) take on the classic FPS formula that, to me at least, felt far more like a spiritual successor to the legendary 1993 original. And now, thanks to id Software's 35th anniversary celebrations, Doom: The Dark Ages is over two-thirds off. I definitely rate this FPS, to the point that I'd personally recommend picking it up over Eternal, so I thought I would bring the discount to the wider PC g…",

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules. As the memory supply crisis went further and further into the red, it became clear that a VRAM-stuffed Super refresh in the coming months was unlikely. The RTX 50-series cards we've tested to da…",

If this is your first miHoYo livestream, it usually runs one every six weeks for each of its games, giving an overview of the characters, events, and quests coming in the latest update. And as a little bonus for tuning in, it drops a few codes that you can redeem to add some extra Stellar Jade to your hoard. If leaks are to be believed, we've got five-star Elation characters Yao Guang and Sparxie on the way, plus more to come in the subsequent Planarcadia updates, similar to how Penacony and Amphoreus gradually released theirs.

And if it can, can HBO and Mazin be trusted to do it justice? Well, depends who you ask. For instance, if you ask Larian CEO Swen Vincke, the future seems pretty bright, all things considered. In a post on X , Vincke said that \"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures,\" so a series that builds on them makes perfect sense. Even more promising, despite Larian having no official involvement with the series, Mazin and co are apparently in touch with the studio: \"Craig did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us,\" wrote Vincke. \"From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope.\" Hooray!

Spoilers ahead for Fallout season 2 At the end of the first season, the levels for each of our main characters were slightly skewed, or at least not where you'd expect them to be. Despite being the main character, Lucy only managed to get to level 8, while The Ghoul sat somewhere around level 89, and Maximus managed to reach level 9. Thaddeus also somehow managed to reach level 50 after accidentally turning himself into a Ghoul (more on that later). So, to wrap up season 2, I've decided to take stock of everything our main characters (plus Norm and Hank) got up to over the course of the eight episodes and see whether they managed to get more or less XP this season. But I'll let you know now, it's not looking good for most of them.
