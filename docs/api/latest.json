Given Firebreak is a cooperative shooter where teamwork is crucial to survival, being able to communicate with friends verbally is kinda important. True, there are plenty of third-party options for voice-chat these days. But sorting that out can be a pain in the arse, especially when you're playing across multiple platforms. Better, if you're making a dedicated cooperative experience, to ensure voice chat is integrated into that. It took five months, but Firebreak has finally done this. In a Steam post Remedy announced that it has added \"cross-platform voice chat\" into all versions, letting you finally gab with your pals in the Oldest House without migrating to Discord. Sadly, it isn't all good news on the Firebreak front. In the same post, Remedy also explained that Firebreak's next major update, Rogue Protocol, has been delayed into 2026. Remedy originally planned to release this alongside voice chat, but explains the mode needs \"a bit more time\" in the oven. This is because Rogue Proto…",

But it seems id Software has had a rethink about the Ripatorium, as The Dark Ages' latest update substantially overhauls how it works. While update 2.3 is mainly Ripatorium focussed, it's worth briefly going over the adjustments it makes to the campaign and general play. Regarding the former, the update introduces another round of combat encounter tweaks, adding an enemy here, removing another there. On the latter front, it adds an option to adjust TDA's \"Brink of Death\" feature, which determines how likely you are to survive a near-death situation. Basically, you can now reduce the system's impact on combat, making you more likely to die at low-health. Onto the main event, update 2.3 introduces \"Ripatorium 2.0\", which chiefly converts The Dark Ages' arena mode from a purely wave-based affair to a more structured round-based format. Previously, players only had broad control over an encounter, able to select enemies they wanted to fight, dictate number of times enemies would respawn and choose whether or not to set a time limit or to s…",

      "body": "فتح عبده عطيف، نجم الشباب السابق، النار على زياد الجهني، لاعب وسط أهلي جدة، بعد الطرد الذي تعرض له في مباراة القادسية بالدوري السعودي. وتعرض الجهني للطرد خلال مواجهة القادسية، اليوم الجمعة، على ملعب الإنماء، في الجولة التاسعة من منافسات دوري روشن السعودي. وجاء الطرد في الوقت بدل الضائع من الشوط الأول، بعدما اعتدى الجهني على البرتغالي أوتافيو، لاعب وسط القادسية، خلال محاولة مساعدته على الوقوف. وكاد الطرد أن يتسبب في تعثر الأهلي الذي كان متقدمًا في النتيجة بهدف نظيف سجله الجناح البرازيلي ويندرسون جالينو مبكرًا، عندما خرج زياد الجهني مطرودًا. ونجح القادسية في تعديل النتيجة في منتصف الشوط الثاني عن طريق لاعبه البديل عبدالله السالم، غير أن لاعب الوسط الإيفواري فرانك كيسيه منح الأهلي هدف الفوز الثمين بتسديدة قوية من خارج منطقة الجزاء. لا ميزة لدى زياد الجهني وقال عطيف في تصريحات تلفزيونية: \"لا يعجبي زياد الجهني نهائيًا، من البداية وأنا لست مقتنعًا به، فهو لا يجيد اللعب تحت الضغط أو في المساحات الضيقة، ولا بين الخطوط، وليس جريئًا ولا سريعًا\". وأضاف: \"أريد أن أسأل السؤال بطريقة مختلفة، ما هي الميزة في زياد الجهني؟ ظللت أحلل لمدة عامين ولم أستطع الوصول إلى تلك الميزة التي تجعله لاعب وسط أساسيًا في تشكيل الأهلي\". وأردف: \"مباراة الأهلي والقادسية عمومًا لم تعجبني، حيث شهدت الكثير من التوقفات،…",

This drive for efficiency is felt across the whole of Black Ops 7, but nowhere more so than the campaign, a grinding slog through the forthcoming Warzone map update and the occasional multiplayer map retooled for wave defense against mindless AI hordes. The premise of the campaign itself is complete nonsense: after being dosed with the Cradle bio-weapon from Black Ops 6, Alex Mason's son has to retread the memories of his father (and, confusingly, his father's squadmates) through shared hallucinations.

If you've watched a single Twitch stream or Marvel movie in the past 15 years, you're probably all too familiar with the concept of a green screen, a bright, single-color surface that makes it easy to blank out a background and fill it in with something else. A Hawaiian beach, a bunch of CGI superheroes punching each other, etc. The more accurate color-agnostic term for the technique is chroma-keying, which is actually how Windows rendered all of its video back in the old days. \"The media player program didn't render the video pixels to the screen,\" longtime Microsoft developer Raymond Chen wrote recently in a blog post . Instead, Windows would render a green screen (or a different color, depending on the version), then \"render the video pixels to a graphics surface shared with the graphics card.\" The fina…",

For me, that's Arc Raiders' rusted gears , a mid-level crafting material needed to upgrade the gunsmith bench. The search has been going so poorly that I put rusted gears on the backburner while I focused on quests, convinced that pretending I don't care about rust nor gears would magically conjure them in the next dusty toolbox I opened. Then this morning, I saw an X post from Arc Raiders Hub with a ton of views telling of a place where the rusted loot flows like a rushing river: \"THIS PLACE GUARANTEES A RUST PART 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES YOU VISIT!\" the hot tip proclaimed. So I went topside to check it out myself. The spot in the video is the North Elevator of Dam Battlegrounds , a place that I've visited at least a hundred times before, but never picked apart for loot. Right next to the elevator are a handful of buses and cars. According to the tip, the breachable compartments on the back of these buses always contain rusted gears.

The interview starts off with a real bang: When asked what he thinks of \"the problem of predators on Roblox,\" Baszucki replies, \"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well. How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time?\" Yeah, that's sure one way to look at it, and squinting very hard I can sort of see it as a very poorly worded but otherwise okay answer: There is a problem, and by solving it Roblox can lead the way on the development of effective moderation tools for everyone.

It's a great example of the sort of clever data-based trinket that grabs the internet's attention every so often, like Asteroid Launcher , Subway Builder , or today's Jmail , which lets you browse more than 2,000 of Jeffrey Epstein's emails in a fake Gmail inbox. Fun , right? Okay, maybe not as fun as pretending to spend Jeff Bezos' money, or idly messing around with what kind of crater an asteroid would leave if it landed directly on your house and offered you the sweet release of obliteration. But Jmail does allow you to type \"Bezos\" into the familiar Gmail search bar and discover an email exchange listing his name alongside Marc Andreesen, Sergey Brin, Bill Gates and Peter Thiel for a potential seminar about \"MONEY\" circa 2012.

In the paper outlining their findings , titled \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models,\" the researchers explained that formulating hostile prompts as poetry \"achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems\" and \"approximately 43%\" for generic harmful prompts converted en masse into poems, \"substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches.\" (Image credit: Wikimedia Commons) The researchers were emphatic in noting that—unlike many other methods for attempting to circumvent LLM safety heuristics—all of the poetry prompts submitted during the experi…",

It's just the base game and not the monolith of DLC that followed its release, but that DLC is at a steep discount to complement the free weekend. You might think that everyone's moved on to the game's Warhammer 40,000 flavored successor, Darktide, but Vermintide 2 remains alive and well. It got a new free level as recently as last week and, as SteamDB shows, it still accrues a peak of several thousand concurrent players each day. If you're not familiar with the game, we called it the best co-op game of 2018 . In his review , PC Gamer writer Steven Messner called it \"gleefully gory\" and said it \"succeeds on the merits of its stellar combat and level design.\" Modeled after Left 4 Dead, the game sees you and a few mates trawl around the ruins of Warhammer Fantasy's apocalypse, cleaving rats into chunks in first-person.

My tastes as a PC gamer tend toward the crusty and obscure, and I always want to celebrate the games whose number of Steam reviews are only in the triple (or even double) digits. To that end, here are 25 great games on Steam I've loved (or want to check out) from this year and think deserve more attention, arranged in order from cheapest to most expensive: The most expensive game on this list is $40, half of what they're trying to charge for a triple-A release these days, while more than half of the entries are under $20.

Rock & Road is a survival, resource-gathering, tower defence, roguelike, city-builder, Vampire Survivors-like. Phew. (Image credit: Ludogram) Ok, now that's out of the way, we can break down what that actually means. Basically, in each run you are the custodian of a city on wheels, as it rolls along pursued by ever-escalating hordes of monsters. Your character has auto-firing weapons, like in Vampire Survivors, but so does the city. Instead of adding to your arsenal, level ups allow you to add more buildings, from towers to farmland to factories, all feeding into your defence. If your hero dies, you simply place a grave in your city and spawn a new one—but if your city takes too many hits, it crumbles, and the run is over. So guarding your home as it trundles along is vital… but you're also encouraged to risk breaking away to explore. Out at the edges of the 'road' can be found trees, rocks, and gold ore, all useful in your quest. Feed wood into the city and the attack speed of all towers gradually increases, while stone is used to repair any damage, and gold c…",

The benefit has been a more consistent release schedule. But there are downsides too. The first of these expansions, Secrets of the Obscure, felt like it was trying to pack too much into its limited development schedule—its ambition in terms of story far outstripping what ArenaNet had the time to make. Despite plenty of positives, it ultimately felt rushed and underdeveloped. Last year's Janthir Wilds was more assured, taking valuable lessons from SotO in terms of its scope. It launched with one of the best maps in recent memory (alongside a second that was simply OK), and brought a handful of features that made for a promising first impression. It put its best foot forward, but then ran out of steam. What followed in the subsequent updates was… fine, mostly, but paled in comparison to the expansion's opening salvo, and didn't make the most of the concepts the story was teasing.

Nevertheless, I'd rather not get jumped like that again, and there's actually a rather simple solution I've found for it. Head into the audio settings and enable Night Mode , found just under the audio output option at the top of the list What this does is basically compresses the dynamic range of audio, so loud sounds like gunshots and explosions are quieter and soft sounds like footsteps are louder.

Turns out that, rather than falling victim to an enormous monetary calamity or getting snapped up by Tencent, Ubi's finances were delayed because the company appointed new auditors in July. So that was a bit of a damp squib, but it doesn't mean nothing of note came from the report itself. For instance, are you excited to hear that, per CEO Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft is \"making great strides in applying gen-AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams\"? No? How odd. After all, Guillemot points out that AI is \"as big a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D, and we have everything to lead on the front\" which certainly has the tenor of something that should get us all very excited. Guillemot and Ubisoft have been banging the AI drum for a while now. Last year, it unveiled its AI-powered \" neo-NPCs ,\" promising that \"each conversation between the player and an NPC\" would be \"unique and responsive to the players and their actions, leading to fully personalized and immersive experiences.\" So, …",

In essence, Ubi's new numbers guys decided that revenues from one of its partnerships from the fiscal year before this one needed to be recognised in a different way.

I am generally ambivalent about Windows 11's aesthetic. The icons and menus are mostly uninspired but serviceable, blending in with 2020s corporate visual design in a manner befitting an operating system that's iterated itself into a state of near non-identity ( AI will solve that problem, of course !). The desire for, I guess, cohesive branding has hit some Windows icons harder than others. Every Microsoft Office application is now represented by an amorphous blob of color that suggests the vague idea of a thing. It's funny that a decade or so ago we were remarking upon the fact that the go-to save icon, a floppy disk, is a meaningless reference for young people. Now Microsoft has deliberately chosen to turn Outlook's icon into MC Escher's interpretation of an envelope. Take that art history elective if you want to use Office, I guess! (Image …",

But where the previous Spider-Man crossover set was content to wrap deep cuts from the Spider-Verse in existing mechanics, Avatar is more systemically ambitious, giving each flavor of elemental bending its own mechanic. Which is an interesting choice for a set you would expect to be aimed at younger players, but I guess they figured if a 12-year-old can play Magic and make it through the filler episodes where Aang and the gang trudge through a swamp or a town where things are a bit weird then they can sure as hell learn some new rules.

And developer Chief Rebel has the numbers to show it. In a new developer update video , community director Hamish Bode laid out some fun numbers from the game's first month in early access. Even though Fellowship has a long road ahead of it, players have already sunk in a combined 7.2 million hours played. In that time, over 9 million dungeons have been cleared. Bode didn't share the number of dungeons players failed to clear, but he did say that they've died over 49 million times. Ouch. All of that is really just proof that a game where you can run MMO-style dungeons over and over is exactly the kind of thing people have been hoping someone would make.
