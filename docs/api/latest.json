The DLC will see Basim, Mirage's protagonist, visiting AlUla, an ancient city key to Saudi Arabian culture. It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup. \"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site. As to the question of whether the DLC is being fully funded by the PIF, Ubisoft says it does \"not comment on rumours.\" It appears that Ubisoft staff are not particularly happy about the publisher getting into bed with the Saudis.

Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range—which looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set. Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree. Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Logitech) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Logitech) The wheelbase itself will be available as a standalone unit starting at $350/€300, and comes with full TrueForce support, which uses game data in combination with audio to approximate some of the details that other direct drive wheels can miss, like engine rumble and precise kerb simula…",

      "body": "Low-profile rapid trigger keyboards are a bit of a niche on a niche, but given faster actuation and less key travel, it makes sense why someone more competitively minded may want to pick one up. Well, Logitech has you covered; it'll just cost you $170. Will that be cash or card? Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t…",

The Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike lets you adjust the mouse click's actuation point or enable rapid trigger, just like you can on a Hall effect or optical keyboard. The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation. This is what Logitech is claiming to have solved thanks to its \"Superstrike\" technology which is a \"combination of inductive analogue sensing and real-t…",

I've been playing the Borderlands series since its inception , but I have something terrible to confess—I have never, not once, been tempted to engage in the endgame. The closest I've ever got was when I rinsed through Borderlands 3's DLCs (many of which were shockingly good ), and even then, that was more coincidental. I'd simply run out of levels, so I was technically in the postgame. But I've never tried to get a build going, farm that all-important legendary, or so much as sneezed at a raid boss. I'm here to play 30 hours of a shooty RPG and then do something else. Borderlands 4 , though? Now I've chewed through the campaign, I'm severely tempted to get stuck back in.

During a preview event for press, studio founder and former Blizzard chief creative officer Rob Pardo said it was inspired by three concepts: Diablo dungeons and progression, PUBG PvP, and Dark Souls combat. I wouldn't blame you for being skeptical, but the result looks more promising than it sounds. (Image credit: Bonfire Studios) Arkheron is set in a \"dark, surreal world,\" where teams of amnesiac souls battle in a purgatorial afterlife to ascend an ever-shifting tower built from the memories of the dead. Teams enter the tower, gain abilities from memory-haunted weapons and equipment, and compete to climb higher before the current floor is destroyed until one team eventually stands triumphant at the tower's apex. At first glance, Arkheron's isometric perspective and hellish environs loudly ring a Diablo-esque bell.

Spotted, as ever, by enterprising Redditors , the words \"龍が如く 極3\"—Japanese for Yakuza Kiwami 3—briefly appeared on the RGG studio site's news page. It's since vanished, but you can easily verify that it was there with Google: the search engine's all-seeing eye cached the page and will still surface it if you ask nicely. With an RGG Summit event happening next week, it didn't take much for those same Redditors to start theorising that someone at RGG had gotten a little ahead of themselves with an announcement pencilled in for the show. \"The summit is next week so they will announce [it] there,\" wrote Ahokai . \"I think Kiwami 3 will be revealed at the RGG Summit next week. But, since RGG is busy with Virtua Fighter 6, Stranger than Heaven, and presumably LaD 9, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes a few years for it to be released,\" wrote a user named Blue_Sheepz .

So, maybe what's needed isn't replacement but reform, and maybe that should be in the form of SHRINK . That's not a new proposal—the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) paper is dated June 2015, coming out of the 42nd annual symposium—but it might be new to you. It was to me. It was brought to my attention by LaurieWired on X , who points out that just 12 of the 1,000+ mnemonics (instructions) on modern CPUs make up 89% of compiled C/C++ code . And even if we don't go down the C/C++ route (as some suggest that this might not cover all instruction bases), the SHRINK research paper shows there are lots of unused instructions over time accounting for all bases: \"We consider instructions that belong to vector extensions in separate categories [than unused], because albeit unused, they are still under adoption and their UISes are likely to be used in the future.\" The apparent over-abundance of instruc…",

When designing the Collector, it was important to the dev team that it would be \"distinct from Leviathans in our previous Subnautica games,\" Cory Strader, the visual development lead, explains in the dev diary. \"We started with multiple rounds of quick, low-detail thumbnail sketches, exploring a wide range of shapes and silhouettes. And out of all of the designs, this Cthulhu-inspired beast resonated with the team.\" (Image credit: Krafton) It certainly looks like the kind of thing that would make my soul leave my body while venturing too far into the deep waters of Subnautica. And crucially, it doesn't just look terrifying; it's also extremely dangerous to players. \"Our main goal with creatures was to make them feel reactive,\" Antonio Munoz Gallego, gameplay lead engineer, says. \"The creature is constantly re-evaluating the situation in real time.\" Accor…",

The leaks, all communicated inexplicably in French, suggest that, well, this is very much an AC game, folks. But not an AC game in the old style—as the original Black Flag was—rather, Ubi is crowbarring its new, Witcher-3-by-another-name RPG style onto the classic pirate sim. Anticipate loot and an inventory, and combat that hews closer to a (much easier) soulslike than the choreographed combat of yore. Which I gotta admit, I'm a little sad about.

That's still probably true—Battlefield 6 is following Call of Duty's model so closely that it's got the same gunsmith system, the same small-scale modes, and the same battle royale spinoff in the works—but Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm are the best evidence yet that this is still Battlefield to the core.

Chris Hall, Senior Director Software Development and head of AMD's ROCm project, which is a software stack for AI development and roughly equivalent to Nvidia's CUDA platform, explained that FSR Redstone—which could be called FSR 5 when it hopefully releases later this year—was developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). Apparently, FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology is \"converted\" into compute Shader code. \"This means that FSR Redstone's neural rendering core can also run on GPUs made by other companies,\" Hall said (via machine translation). In other words, it doesn't require AI or matrix math cores, just as Nvidia's DLSS technology requires Tensor cores. It can run on conventional GPU shaders. \"ML2CODE-based frameworks, such as FSR Redstone, can be seamlessly integrated directly into DirectX or Vulkan graphics pipelines with minimal latency. We believe that the ML2CODE solution is the bes…",

The ban is said to specifically prevent certain Chinese companies from ordering and testing the RTX Pro 6000D, a product designed specifically for the Chinese market. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) handed out the ban to several companies, including TikTok owner ByteDance and Alibaba earlier this week, according to three of the FT's sources. Speaking to reporters in London on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that he expected to discuss the situation with US president Donald Trump during his state visit to the UK this week. \"We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,\" he said. \"I'm disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out between China and the US, and I'm understanding of that. We are patient about it.\" The ban looks to be the latest move in a long and sometimes-troubled relationship between Nvidia and China in regards to its AI GPU products, and comes mere weeks after the older H20 models were reportedly paused from production as a result of security…",

That refresh added a new share button, and it adds a lot for someone like me who clips arguably far too much from my games. However, when we got our hands on the GameSir G7 Pro , we knew it was special, and it has now been crowned the best PC controller by us here at PC Gamer. The G7 Pro absolutely deserves the pro name. The front plate, thumbsticks, and face buttons can be swapped out and replaced. The red model we tested came with three included D-pads, but only the one face plate. As well as coming with programmable paddle buttons at the bottom, the G7 Pro has two near the top bumper, and, most importantly, the thumbsticks are Hall effect, which means you can say goodbye to drift. Stick drift is pretty much the biggest downside of the Xbox controller, but that's not the only way this little GameSir wonder comes out on top. It's super solid and has lovely, clicky buttons. …",

A spin-off of a popular game from a different developer, jumping on a new genre bandwagon, and seemingly built mostly with reused assets. But over the last few years I've played a lot of different Vampire Survivors imitators, and all the way through DRG:S's run in early access, I think it's been the king of the pack.

They booted up Doom on an old PDA, expecting it to crash at some point. That's because every time the game demo would run and then reset, the engine would store a new variable. Then it'd start up again, and again store a new variable. All in one long string until, blam-o, it'd crash due to an overflow—the data exceeding the possible bounds of the value used to store it. Though how long it'd take to crash was all theoretical, until it wasn't. Minki ran a physical test on an old PDA—you don't need much to run Doom, as proven by that time someone played it in a PDF file , or a badge for a hacking conference , or even on its own box . They then left the game running, which would cause the demo to loop over and over, to see how long it'd take to crash.

They aren't strictly necessary (I'm not sure they all count towards 100% completion), but each one is a challenge you'll want to encounter if you're a completionist. These mementos aren't available until Act 3, mainly because the quests don't spawn, or you don't have the relevant movement abilities like Silk Soar. Below, I'll explain how to get every memento. Obviously, this will contain some spoilers for Act 3 content , though not really in regard to the main story itself.

This will \"show your installed games from multiple PC storefronts, including your Xbox library, Xbox Game Pass, Battle.net and other leading PC storefronts.\" Getting to those storefronts should be easier, too, as you can use the new 'My Apps' tab in your library to house Battle.net and so on.

      "body": "It's not even been out for a full week yet, and there is already a mountain of broken builds in Borderlands 4 , from Vex bleed builds to Harlowe's pocket nuke and Rafa's army of gun buffs. But there's one character we all severely underestimated, Amon. Looking at his skill trees, he's a bit…bland compared to the other characters , and after picking him as my main Vault Hunter, it's not far from the truth. He's generally quite clunky and just doesn't have as many broken perks as the other characters. Well, it turns out that Amon is secretly the most busted character of the bunch (and that's saying something), thanks to a potentially unintended interaction between the Berserk and There Is Only Death perks, and the Groundbreaker specialisation. The kicker is that all you need to do is punch. The goal is to stack as much bonus damage as possible from Berserk (cryo) and Groundbreaker (kinetic). You might question how we benefit from Groundbreaker, since it only triggers on non-melee damage, but the bonus cryo damage applied to melee from Berserk actually does the trick. So, every time you punch, you deal increased damage and infinitely stack even more bonus damage for the next punch. M…",

If you were hoping for some more boss nerfs or perhaps fewer obstacles on the way to bosses, then give up all hope ye who enter here. No, the latest Silksong patch—which is currently live in the public-beta branch on Steam, but will roll out officially in the coming days—is mostly about making sure the bosses themselves don't keep making dumb mistakes. Spoilers follow, but this includes: Preventing the Savage Beastfly in Far Fields from getting stuck under lava, preventing Shrine Guardian Seth from exiting the battle arena mid-combat, and making sure Lugoli stops \"flying off screen and not returning during battle\". I like a tough metroidvania and wouldn't advocate for any difficulty tweaks, but I know there are plenty of players who are frustrated with Silksong's difficulty.

Redditors have been compiling the evidence pointing towards a VR hardware reveal from Valve on Wednesday, including multiple VR-focused YouTubers traveling to the Pacific Northwest. Competitor Meta is actually hosting its annual Connect event on September 17th and 18th, but multiple influencers have confirmed they won't be at the event (which is in Silicon Valley, not Valve's native Bellevue, Washington). Notably, Valve timed its last big VR reveal of the Index to coincide with a Facebook developer event in 2019. It sure seems like it's pulling the same strategy again for the Steam Frame, and if I had to guess its pitch will be much more focused on gaming and high-end VR tech while Zuckerberg uses Meta Connect as an excuse to hock some new AI stuff that'll make all of our lives a little…",

That can't be right, I thought. That would be such a fundamental bug that it would effectively break the game. Anyway, I loaded in, did some testing, and you can probably guess where this is going. We are investigating an issue where players are unable to respawn in Solo Ops activities after dying. We are attempting to solve this issue as soon as we're able. More information will be provided when available. September 16, 2025 From my own experience, once you die the respawn button will appear after the usual countdown, but cannot be interacted with. In order to start playing again you either need to go to orbit (ie, leave the activity) or switch characters. Which is as big a problem as it sounds. The bug even seems to extend to Patrol zones, although I was o…",

This will be most exciting if you don't own Escape from Tarkov yet and have been holding out for this very moment. If you already own it and want to play it through Steam, though, you'll need to buy it again and link your Steam account to your existing Tarkov profile, Battlestate confirmed in a blog post. It's all on the same servers so you won't have to buy the Steam version to play with Steam players, and you've always had the option of adding Tarkov as a non-Steam game to your library if all you want is the ease of access and the overlay. But all the other big features—friend list synchronization, Steam achievements, lifelong playtime tracking—will be exclusive to those who buy it through the platform.

It hits all the narrative and aesthetic beats I expect out of a modern spy thriller, and through that lens, I think it looks pretty neat. There's a mysterious wristwatch with coveted blueprints inside it somehow and yes, they plug it into a giant wall of green monitors, and yes, I eat that kind of thing up. But short of a few referential nods, I think the trailer is sadly a little light on Splinter Cell vibes specifically. It's a lot of action and energy for largely methodical, unhurried stealth games. My favorite moments in Splinter Cell never involved big fist fights or car chases, they involved silently panicking as guards circled me hiding in the one safe shadow in a patrol-filled room. Guns and brawls were a sign things had gone wrong, and I was most elated when the only enemies that ever saw me ended up unconscious in a crate somewhere. Okay, maybe that wouldn't make …",

Several Unique items and their powerful guaranteed stats will have new Chaos variants that are even more powerful than normal and can be equipped in new slots on your character. The idea is that a Unique that could only drop as gloves before can now show up as a pair of boots or some other piece, which opens up all kinds of combinations and new builds. \"A lot of us in the office are fans of card games, and what you do in card gaming is you typically build a deck from a bunch of different cards,\" game designer Aislyn Hall explained when asked about the inspiration for Chaos Armor on the stream. \"When I'm building my character in an ARPG, or a Diablo, I think about it in the same lens.\" Diablo 4 seasons have never felt this experimental.

Such was the impact of the latter that, despite not being included in the initial round of cuts, long-serving ZeniMax president Matt Firor fell on his sword after 18 years as studio head. \"He wore a lot of different hats,\" says Rich Lambert, the new studio game director at Zenimax, in a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz .

That's where the best XP farms come in, netting you heaps of experience to level up fast and with less effort, so you can focus on your favourite bits. If it's your first run through the campaign, I'd generally recommend just completing the story and exploring the open world—there's little reason to grind before then. Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters . Best Borderlands 4 XP farms The two best ways to farm XP in Borderlands 4 are to complete bounty contracts and grind drill site activities , with the latter being even better when you're playing in co-op.

      "body": "A collective of 15 ransomware gangs including Scattered Spider, IntelBroker and Lapsus$ have announced a mass retirement from their nefarious activities. They claim their \"objectives\" have been fulfilled, so it's time to enjoy their \"millions\" in \"silence\". As spotted by El Reg , the collective posted a message on Breachforums announcing their supposed retirement. \"Silence will now be our strength,\" the statement said, \"we [] have decided to go dark\". As for what's next, the statement says the some among the collective (apparently the most \"stupid\") will enjoy their \"golden parachutes with the millions the group accumulated,\" while others, \"will keep on studying and improving systems you use in your daily lifes. In silence.\" The group points out that further attacks may be attributed to them, but these were masterminded and carried out before the retirement decision. The group claims that efforts by law enforcement to track them down will be futile, while implying that the arrests already made of some members of their gangs in France were all part of a master plan. \"We have ensured that the investigations targeting them will progressively fall apart, and that their mild vanity pec…",

      "body": "Somewhat surprisingly, Nvidia doesn't have much of a track record when it comes to using cutting-edge silicon. But a new report claims that's about to change dramatically, with Nvidia planning to be the very first to use TSMC's next-next gen A16 node. Taiwanese outlet CTEE claims that Nvidia will be the first to adopt TSMC's A16 node due to competition from AMD, in part for what it calls HPC or high performance chips built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node and due out this year. The only N2 chips AMD has planned for next year, as far as we know, are server CPUs, not GPUs. AMD's next major AI GPU release, MI450 , is expected to be on TSMC N3 silicon. Nvidia currently uses a version of TSMC's N4 node for all its GPUs. N4 is actually a refinement of N5, which dates back to 2020. Meanwhile, the first chip made on TSMC's N3 technology, the Apple A17 Pro SoC for iPhones, debuted back in 2023. Consequently, Nvidia is now bumping up against what's known as the reticle limit with its Blackwell generation of GPUs . That's a physical limit on the size of an individual chip that can be etched onto a wafer. That physical size in turn puts a hard limit on how many transistors can be squeezed into a si…",

Hernandez, who played main character Jacob Diaz, said in a chat with Frvr that being, in essence, the public face of a failed videogame is a pretty tough thing to go through (even though Hernandez's performance was good, as far as I'm aware). \"It's hard. I'm not gonna lie about that,\" said Hernandez. Not just for himself, mind you, but \"for the 300 or so employees at Build A Rocket Boy, you're like 'I hope this goes really well.'
