It's a more historical approach to grand strategy, in that you can no longer found the United States at the same time as the invention of agriculture, and was one way Firaxis hoped to encourage players to actually finish the games they started rather than getting bored and bailing prematurely (which it noticed a lot of us doing).

EA is still being coy about the details, but what little else we know about Redsec has been gleaned from leaked playtests and the studio's own communications. We know it'll take place on a map set in California, feature the series' signature destruction and vehicles, and that its shrinking circle is a deadly ring of fire capable of killing meandering squads instantly. Of course, we'll know a lot more when Redsec officially drops tomorrow. Here's exactly when that's happening. Battlefield RedSec release date and time for each region After weeks of rumors about an impending shadow drop, EA decided to give everyone a day's notice. Battlefield Redsec is out October 28 , but the exact timing depends on your region. West Coast US: 8 am PT East Coast US: 11 am ET UK: 3 pm GMT Europe: 4 pm CET Redsec is launching alongside Battlefield 6 Season 1 , which itself includes a new multiplayer map, mode, guns, and a battle pass.

And equally, how few are playable anywhere but the DS, even 15 years after Nintendo stopped making new handhelds. Steam has seen HD remasters of some of the DS's best games over the years: Zero Escape Etrian Odyssey 1,2, and 3 Ace Attorney Trilogy Castlevania Dominus Collection Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective But it's a weirdly short list given just how many bangers came out on the DS over the course of its life.

This multi-layered PCB is a fairly unique bit of hardware design, not only allowing for cleaner signal routing but also a neat little perch for a warm beverage. To be clear, I'm not recommending you crack open your extremely expensive GPU and fashion its pricey guts into a drinks coaster (though I bet that would look sick). Instead, I'm suggesting you take a gander at Printables user jq910's wares and 3D print yourself an RTX 5090 FE PCB Drink Coaster (via Videocardz ). Even if you don't already own a 3D printer, I bet this one is a cheaper craft than cracking open a two-grand card. All of the PCB's major components are accurately represented within the printable 3D files. However, jq910 writes that they chose to omit the power connector \"because it would get in the way of larger cups and also make the coaster annoying to stack.\" As such, jq910's representation of the PCB is somewhat simplified, and also much flatter than the…",

So it's lovely to discover that Mechanicus 2 is shaping up to be even bigger and better. Playing the free demo currently available on Steam, I'm really impressed with how the core strategy has evolved. (Image credit: Bulwark Studios) In the first game's Adeptus Mechanicus vs Necron battles (think weirdo religious cyborgs vs ancient alien cyborgs, if you're unfamiliar), the key was a resource called cognition. Harvested from terminals and pillars in the environment, it was used to fuel special abilities and extra movement, but was shared across your whole team, forcing careful decision-making. For the sequel, that system's been ramped right up. Now, cognition is generated by units directly in ways that define their role on the team. Lumbering melee servitors, for example, grant you a point every time they take damage, while your Skitarii rangers instead generate one every time they shoot someone from far enough away.

Is Unreal Engine 5 the right vessel for a remake? Will God strike us down for putting a Halo game on a Sony console? All these questions and more arose, along with a bit of controversy. For instance, original Halo designer Jaime Griesemer was vocally disappointed with the new remake , calling it out for mucking with the level design in a way he reckoned was deleterious for the game as a whole. Well, buckle up, because yet another Halo OG has entered the ring and this one's a lot more positive. Marcus Lehto, art director on Halo 1, 2 and 3 and \" father of Master Chief ,\" took to X to declare that he's a fair bit keener on the remake than his former compatriots. \"It warms my heart to see Halo CE like this,\" says the man himself. \"My honest impression of seeing the new Halo Campaign Evolved is this,\" wrote Lehto, \"I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine. It's gorgeous in a way I wish we could have built it originally back in 2001.\" Which is quite the stamp of approval from the original game's art director, I suppose, …",

The Outer Worlds 2, despite getting a solid thumbs up by resident RPG sicko Ted Litchfield in his review , is no exception. See, the $100 premium edition of the game gives you access to Obsidian's latest five whole days early. Also, to be fair, a few bonuses that are technically worth the price—two future DLCs, access to the artbook and soundtrack, and a couple of bundles with armours and weapons in them. Standard stuff. Oh, and also the privilege of Obsidian sticking its tongue out at you and going ner-ner. See, in The Outer Worlds 2, you can pick up optional \"Flaws\". These are typically curse/kiss debuffs with a slight upside, forcing you to play around them—and they're typically triggered by certain in-game events.

Thermaltake must have realised this because its latest AIO liquid CPU cooler has taken cooler screens to a new level, but it's also given it a whole bunch of neat extra features. The cooler in question is the Thermaltake Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB Sync (via Hermita Akiba on X ), and the name alone gives you all the clues you need to guess what the AIO cooler looks like, assuming you've not taken a gander at the images yet. Where most vendors have been content to add a single LCD screen to their AIO blocks, Thermaltake has added four individual displays to the Minecube: one facing straight up, and the other three forming a 'wrap-around' effect, starting on the rear IO side of the motherboard before finishing at the DRAM slots side. Admittedly, having a screen facing the rear IO panel doesn't make much sense, because you're barely going to see it in an average PC case. Anyway, using Thermaltake's software, you can apply individual animated GIFs to each panel or have them display hardware info, such as temperatures and clock …",

Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not a groundbreaking game by any stretch of the imagination, but that doesn't make it bad. If you haven't played a Jurassic World Evolution game before, it is exactly what it says on the tin: a park-building simulator where you raise, research, and sell tickets to see dinosaurs, but it doesn't dare to step outside of that boundary. You'll create buildings, connect them to paths and power them with electricity before inviting guests, alongside sending out research teams to discover new species you'll eventually get to hatch and raise. The cycle continues. This time around, there are a few notable quality-of-life improvements, such as automating pesky maintenance tasks like repairing fences after a storm or caring for any sick dinosaurs, which makes park life a lot easier.

You can't quite get there. Or if you do get there, what you brought to the party no one wants to play anyway.\" As the article notes, Layden's tenure oversaw a trio of Sony's singleplayer knockouts, and part of why he left the company was due to their live-service pivot, which he quips were \"not my skillset.\" Layden oversaw God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima.

Compared to the start of 2025, when GPUs were in short supply and prices for many models bordered on the ludicrous, the final quarter of 2025 is a much nicer affair. 👉 The best early Black Friday PC gaming deals right here 👈 Entry-level, budget, and most mainstream graphics cards are generally priced at or below their MSRP, despite import tariffs. It's only the likes of the Radeon RX 9070 XT and GeForce RTX 5090 that remain overpriced. We're expecting new graphics cards from Nvidia in the new year, when it launches the Super variants of its RTX 50-series cards. That means we could see big discounts on RTX 5070 and RTX 5080 cards, as retailers try to clear inventory. We could also see something new from AMD and Intel, but there hasn't been much gossip about these so far. When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 kicks off Friday, 28 November 2028 and runs for three days over the whole weekend.

Mid-range buyers will be well-served by RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti machines, whereas if you've got the cash to splash, even RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 gaming PCs will be dropping in price. Oh, and don't rule out AMD GPUs, either. The RX 9060 XT is an excellent budget gaming graphics card, while the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are very quick mid-range performers.

X account ModernWarzone (who exposed that very bad bong gun in Black Ops 6 last year ) writes : \"A new content drop for Battlefield 6 that is NOT Season 1 codenamed 'Granite' with release date of October 28th has been datamined from the EA App.\" The screenshot, shared here by user YourAkhiNeo , states that \"Granite\" has a \"playablestartdate\" of October 28, 2025.

That's where design documents come in—living, comprehensive treatises that outline all a game's systems and design goals to be referenced by those working on the game—at least, for some. Johan Andersson, lead on Europa Universalis 5, said in an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens that the practice can be too rigid and restraining. For Paradox Tinto, good design comes with a bit of democracy. \"Design documents stifle creativity and it reduces people's ownership and empowerment,\" Andersson said. \"You create better games by talking with your team … tell the person some broad outlines, like 'we want this,' 'it should function like this,' a few samples, and let them make the detailed decisions.

The latest trailer does just that, by informing us that Boltgun 2 will let us choose a second playable character. That character being Nyra Veyrath, a Celestian of the Sisters of Battle, to be specific. She wields a bolt pistol/power sword combo, switching to a meltagun or flamer when the enemies of the Imperium need a good superheating, and has some good mobility, with a slide move I couldn't imagine the bulky space marine Malum Caedo pulling off. As well as letting us choose between two protagonists, Boltgun 2 will have a branching campaign, with different decisions leading you through different levels. It'll also have more biomes than the first game, including a jungle swamp and a hive city to fight through. Looks like there's an ice world too?

It won him over, though, as he said his impressions: \"Under its deceptive meme game veneer, Escape From Duckov is an excellent topdown shooter that smartly repackages the extraction shooter in a satisfying singleplayer format.\" Singleplayer extraction shooter might sound like a bit of an oxymoron—the genre is all about evading other players to escape with your life and loot—but Duckov is stuffed with all sorts of quests and a base to kit out with upgrades, essentially squeezing the genre into the framework of a roguelite RPG.
