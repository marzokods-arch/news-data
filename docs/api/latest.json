      "body": "Spry Fox, the Seattle-based studio behind cozy games like Cozy Grove , got purchased by Netflix back in 2022 when the streaming giant was really trying to get into this whole videogame thing.

Alas, no, as it turns out that a very popular web app framework, used heavily in servers around the world, has been discovered to have a maximum severity security bug.

Specifically, the vulnerability \"allows unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting a flaw in how React decodes payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints.\" Translating this to something more understandable, it basically means somebody can use a remote web request of a server running React JavaScript or a React-based application framework, and ultimately run dodgy code to extract data, override systems, or what have you.

Naturally, I just assumed the player had died, and the game had bugged to make their death pose look a little funky. It turns out that I was almost bang on the money. Now illuminated having watched Jinko's latest Arc Raiders mythbusting video, I've learned that these players stuck in place are the result of forcing the game closed, such as the ol' ALT+F4 or disconnecting—not from being killed or even surrendering to return to the main menu. Because you've been forced out of the match, you're able to rejoin and pick right up where you left off if you haven't been killed in your absence.

While the move had been long planned and not unexpected, the change did have one disappointing outcome: every game that used 32-bit PhysX libraries for visual effects would be forced to either disable it or process them on the CPU. Well, not any more, as Nvidia has had a change of heart and it's back again in the latest driver set. However, it is worth noting that the new Game Ready Driver 591.44 drivers won't suddenly run every 32-bit CUDA program, as Nvidia has only added support for certain games. Fortunately, it seems to be all the popular ones that were badly affected by the CUDA change, as detailed in the relevant driver blog . The full list of revitalised games is: Alice: Madness Returns Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Batman: Arkham City Batman: Arkham Origins Borderlands 2 Mafia II Metro 2033 Metro: Last Light Mirror’s Edge Batman: Arkham Asylum will eventually join the others, but not until \"the first part of 2026\".

      "body": "As AI continues to balloon and pull in even more investment, one of the fiercest debates (other than copyright , ethics , and the environment ) is about whether or not it's a bubble. AMD's Lisa Su has weighed in on the debate. Recently, in an interview with Wired , the AMD chief was asked if she thought AI was a bubble. Her response: “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” Su claims that fears around a potential bubble are \"somewhat overstated\". Unfortunately, as this is part of the Wired Big Interview series, and the larger interview hasn't been published yet, it's hard to fully surmise where Su's stance lies outside of this answer. In its barest form, a bubble is where the asset price in some industry far exceeds actual value, due in part to speculation. The 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble popping didn't mean people wouldn't buy houses or use the internet, but that the value tied up in it exceeded what it was worth, and those betting billions on it could no longer see a return on investment. Investment is certainly there when it comes to AI. Nvidia is the first company to have been valued at $5 trillion . Nvidia, in turn, invested $100 billion into OpenAI back in S…",

Alas, he's been in a state of kind-of-retirement in recent years, doing bits and pieces of contract work for Obsidian, his former employer, and others, but generally contenting himself with his YouTube channel, where he chats about game design, career anecdotes, and how he's in \" semi-retirement \" now. Well, no longer. In his most recent video, Cain announced that he's moved back to California, gone back to full-time work at Obsidian (as an in-office, not remote, worker), gained several new t-shirts and a Moon Man tattoo, and befriended a squirrel in the time since he last updated us on his job situation. Which is quite a lot. I get tired if I have to go to the post office and go to work on the same day. \"I'm back at Obsidian,\" an energetic Cain told viewers. \"I'm their full-time employee, and in-person, not remote. So I'm not a contractor anymore.\" What's he working on? Well, wouldn't you like to know?…",

      "body": "Prices for SSDs are not very stable right now. While not hit anywhere near as bad as memory, we're seeing price increases on many SSDs on a pretty regular basis. So if the prices here don't match up when you read this, that's likely why. We recommend using a price checker tool, such as CamelCamelCamel, to see if you're still getting a good deal. It's been one year since I first reviewed the (now Sandisk) WD Blue SN5000 , and boy oh boy, what a year it's been. That drive, at the time, didn't have a lot going for it. It was hot. It was slow. It was beaten by cheaper options, and thanks to using aging QLC NAND flash, it didn't quite deliver on the promises it made in a way that it needed to. Thankfully, the brand spanking new Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 I have here on review remedies practically every single one of my initial complaints. From a newer, refined controller to far more advanced (though still QLC) NAND flash package with higher densities and better all-around performance, it makes a damn good argument for being one of the best SSD s money can buy, at least if the price is right. So much so that it enjoys a lovely 21% increase in score over the OG SSD. Now, interestingly, Sandi…",

But with the new Dream Team feature coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley as part of the Winter Ball update on Wednesday, December 10, this problem might be removed entirely. In a reel posted to the Disney Dreamlight Valley YouTube channel , more details have been shown about what exactly this feature does. With this addition, you'll be able to join forces with a group of seven friends, give yourself a name, motto, and a logo, and then start requesting materials. This can be anything from crafting materials like clay and iron, to quest items like fish, flowers, and crops. If you'd rather fulfil a request from your friend instead, it's just as easy as placing one. When you're in the Dream Teams menu, you'll see every item that each of your friends has asked for.

This update plans to take us away from the sterile halls of the Murkoff facility and into what looks like a desolate lodge.

That's very counter-intuitive: Steam is far and away the dominant PC storefront, and conventional wisdom states that if you're not there, you're missing out on a major chunk of potential revenue. Witness, for instance, the reaction to the recent ban of Horses on Steam : Yeah, it was also dropped by the Epic Games Store and, for a day, Humble, but Steam is the one that really hurt, and developer Santa Ragione said losing it might force the studio to close. But Hypixel Studios has a very good reason for taking a pass on it: Steam user reviews. \"We want to spend our time in Early Access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing,\" Hytale executive director Patrick \"Lyall\" Derbic wrote in a new FAQ . \"Steam is a great marketing tool but one that we might never need.

Neither Eidos nor parent company Embracer Group (yes, it's an Embracer studio) have confirmed the layoffs or responded to requests for comment.

Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Rhell: Warped Worlds & Troubled Times now on Steam Rhell is a game about solving puzzles with unique combinations of runes, and as much as it's a game about a \"sassy and sharp-tongued sage\", it's really all about experimentation. Equipped with a tome brimming with spell segments, all of which fit together in a plethora of unique ways, you'll move through the adventure crafting spells on the fly. The new trailer for the game—aired during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted—talks of a million ways to cross an electrified lagoon. It encourages you to hold down a button by employing your freshly manifested doppelganger to stay behind and then turning them into a puddle. What will happen if you combine the push and goo abilities? Who knows? Find out! Aesthetics wise, Rhell is set in a lovely cell shaded world of cartoonistic…",

Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Rivage on Steam The reveal trailer introduces us to Miranda, a scientist from the 25th century sent to study the newly discovered planet VESTA. The space station A.R.E.S is supposed to be the base from which she'll determine if the stellar body can be colonized by an expanding human civilization, but it's hit with a powerful magnetic field that warps the very fabric of time and space itself. Not the best day for her, but as a scientist, this is just another problem for Miranda to solve. The trailer shows off some of the puzzles you'll be completing, and I hope you've brushed up on your astrophysics, because there's a lot of mathematical formulas on the whiteboards.

The camera pans across labyrinthine pipework and imposing gothic structures silhouetted by throbbing red neon. It's industrial, alien, and dystopian in equal measure. We get small snippets of the creatures that inhabit this world: fleshy, twisted patchworks of metal and skin that seem to leer at us like they're possessed. It's proper nightmare fuel, the kind of monsters dreamt up by Giger or Beksiński, or that nasty neighbour kid from Toy Story. Scene set, and it's onto the action.
