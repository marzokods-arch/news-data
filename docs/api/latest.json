      "body": "SNK dropped a trailer for season 2 of Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, set to kick off on January 22, and an awful lot of fans aren't happy about it. The problem isn't the second season of character DLC, but the trailer promoting it, which many of them think is laden with AI generated content. Comments on YouTube accusing the trailer of being made with generative AI began flowing almost immediately after it was posted. Some called out specific characters who look AI generated; quite a few others made the point that SNK is backed by serious money now and shouldn't be looking to cut corners with gen AI. SNK was effectively acquired in 2022 by Saudi Arabia's Electronic Gaming Development Company , a division of the Mohammed bin Salman Foundation. Bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia (and credibly accused murderer ), is the prime mover behind the $55 billion buyout of Electronic Arts. So, yeah, a shortage of funds should not be an issue. \"All that Saudi money and can't pay someone a couple bucks to make real shit,\" YouTube commenter willthelemon5681 wrote.

      "body": "Amazon has released the first photo of actor Sophie Turner as Lara Croft alongside the announcement that production of its new Tomb Raider show is underway. The costume follows the upcoming Tomb Raider remake , Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, in straightforwardly recreating Lara's classic '90s look, with the minor tweak that her shorts are black rather than brown. Here's the full photo: (Image credit: Amazon) Overall, the reveal seems to have gone better than Netflix's 2018 reveal of Henry Cavill as Geralt . Cavill's makeup and costuming ended up looking respectable in the show, but it was hard to tell that was going to be the case from our first look—that wig sure looked wiggy. In contrast, Turner's Lara seems to be fairly uncontroversial; not everyone's favorite take on the character, but there's no big upset over it. (In saying that, I do have to exclude X's substantial population of massive losers, who have taken to complaining about the actor's proportions and using Grok to alter the photo in replies to the official Tomb Raider account . Truly wild that this sort of public behavior is now commonplace!) Alongside Turner, best known for her role as Sansa Stark in Game of Thron…",

The game has now been delisted from Steam and every platform you could buy it on, and will only be playable by anyone who already owns it.

There will be no refunds for Marks of Fortune, the MMO's premium currency.

Depending on your point of view, Bungie's Marathon reboot might have the most generous or restrictive free loadout of the bunch. As detailed in a new vidoc showing off all of Marathon's runner shells (essentially hero characters), Bungie says Rook is a unique class option that functions like a free loadout. You can't bring anything in with you, but you're supplied with basic kit for free and can keep whatever you find on a raid. That's more-or-less how the free loadout works in Arc Raiders, the most popular extraction shooter of the moment, but Bungie's implementation is different in two major ways: Rook players will always enter a match late, making it harder to compete for the best loot on the map Rook players can only queue solo Depending on where you land on Arc Raiders' free loadout debate , that could be fantastic news.

Beyblade was at the height of its popularity in my hometown, and I'd asked my parents for an imported Driger V2 from a website selling toys from overseas, because—as Pokémon cards had taught my generation—Japanese collectibles possess an inherently greater potency. It was a sinister implement: a two-tiered engine of plastic-bladed violence. In its first match against my older brother's Beyblade, it detonated his feeble bit of Toys \"R\" Us fodder on contact. Once the ensuing shrapnel settled, I knew I had gained command of a terrible power. I wielded a battle top that should not be. And thanks to From the Top , a recently-launched top-battling roguelike, it's a feeling I can once again relive.

The length of runs is perfect, there's the perfect amount of distractions to regularly pull you away from the best-laid plans, and the exhilaration of making it out never gets old. And yet… man, do I dislike my inventory. It's slightly weird that a game that gets so much bang-on fumbles when it comes to inventory management and loadouts. Your stash is a key part of these games: it's what you're going in for, after all. But I really find it a bit of a pain sometimes in Arc Raiders, especially when I just want to get back in there without clicking through 15 screens and working out what I can and can't recycle or sell. It's the one bit of the game's rhythm that feels off. Turns out I'm far from alone. Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins told PCG sister site GamesRadar+ that Embark Studios is \"super aware\" of players' gripes around loadouts and shuffling items around between runs.

According to de_Tylmarande, their mod doesn't actually unlock any of the DLC, but instead skips the check confirming it is present, subverting a system-heavy process and leading to a major frame rate boost. MH Wilds - Bad performance mystery (Solved?) from r/MonsterHunter \"The more DLC you own, the better performance you get in the game\", claims the redditor. \"On the account with no DLC I get heavy and stable FPS drops down to like 20-25 in hubs, while on the account with all DLC bought its 80+ FPS.\" To test out this DLC-boosting theory, I performed some benchmarking runs of my own, both on a fresh, DLC-less copy of the game, and one with all 189 (!) …",

One hardware channel, though, is claiming that it definitely will. That's according to Golden Pig Upgrade on Weibo, as reported by Videocardz , which says that the launch of the Core Ultra 200 Plus range (the rumoured name for the Arrow Lake refresh chips) will arrive in either March or April (via machine translation). Evidence for the refresh itself comes in the form of entries in the Geekbench database. For example, this Core Ultra 9 290K Plus was uploaded only a few days ago, though it's possible that it's not genuine (i.e. it's actually a Core Ultra 9 285K result with a rejigged name). Six months ago, I readily accepted the suggestion that Intel was planning on doing an Arrow Lake refresh, if only because it's done that sort of thing many times before in the past.

He was able to replicate the issue, which doesn't seem like the worst thing in the world when conveyed via an embedded video, but becomes practically cornea-sizzling if it happens to you while you're sitting directly in front of a 32-inch OLED monitor. Thankfully, this 'flash bang' file explorer bug should now be no more, thanks to a fix contained in the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 28020.1371 which has already begun rolling out via the Canary Channel. The update, displaying the typical art of understatement usually deployed in patch notes, describes the fix as addressing \"an issue causing File Explorer to show a white flash when navigating between pages for some Insiders after the previous flight.\" On the one hand, I'm personally not loving how often being a Windows Insider feels a bit like being an unpaid QA tester for Microsoft.

One of the hurdles lies in dungeon \"routing\". Because Mythic+ dungeons are all on a timer, and because WoW's dungeons tend to be a little more open-plan than something you'd get in, say, Final Fantasy 14, every single dungeon has a bespoke route filled with little tricks. And because this is Mythic+, you are expected to know them immediately, lest you be deemed a n00b, or something far ruder, which I won't publish on this website. Well, Blizzard's tinkering with a solution. On the Midnight beta test servers, the studio's introduced a new \"affix\"—basically a modifier—to Mythic+ levels 2-5.

QPAD didn't give me my first ever mechanical keyboard—that honour goes to the original Razer BlackWidow—but it gave me my second, becoming one of my favourite upgrades I've had over all my years PC gaming. Back then, the QPAD MK-50 was one of a handful of great value mechanical gaming keyboards in what was then a pretty niche market. That keyboard lasted me years, and offered simple quality for a great price. Then the company all but disappeared, (in the UK at least, where I'm based).

And yet, such an abundance of hardware in a relatively simple device is also what makes them all the more compelling to tinker with—especially by, say, coaxing an unlikely kitchen device into running Doom. Case in point, German tech creator Aaron Christophel has got the original boomer shooter working on the touch screen of the Krups Cook4Me Smart cooking pot . It proves surprisingly easy to dismantle the kitchen appliance, with the bottom separating the heating elements from your counter top secured by a single screw (conversely, the separate touch screen module is firmly held in place with a whole two screws). The cooking pot's 'smarts' are down to the Renesas R7S721031VC SoC (system on a chip), which uses a 400 MHz Cortex-A9 microprocessor. Working in concert with 128 MB of RAM and 128 MB of Flash, these modest tech specs are more than enough to play 1993's Doom at a reasonable framerate.

The new mode, Soul Savior Monster Train 2 takes place in heaven, but the new mode, Soul Savior, plays out in a spacey, ethereal realm called the Soulstream, where you fight to reclaim souls from a final boss called the Lifemother. The mode isn't a novelty side attraction, but a fresh way of playing Monster Train 2 that the studio wants to be equal in depth and complexity to the main game.

Well, the major memory maker has just announced its intentions to accelerate construction plans for one fab by three months, now aiming to finish up in February 2027. Furthermore, an already-existing fab is expected to start churning out wafers as soon as next month. This follows news earlier this week that the South Korean memory manufacturer planned to invest a further 19 trillion won (or $12.90 billion) into another advanced chip packaging facility in Cheongju. The company announced in December that it planned \"to invest approximately 30% of our sales in facilities in 2026 and accelerate the transition to 1c DRAM , but it will be difficult to resolve the supply shortage.\" Expanding production was always part of the plan—but the AI industry's demand for memory has been scaling up faster than production can match.

Wine, a compatibility app for running non-Linux games on Linux has just hit version 11.0. You can find the full list of changes in the release notes , but there are a few main takeaways (via Gaming on Linux ). The first is that WoW64 mode, which can run 32-bit applications, is now considered fully supported and even includes 16-bit apps. As Windows can't natively run 16-bit applications, it's now as hard (or as easy) to run 16-bit apps on Linux as on Windows. Another big update with Wine 11, following on from its introduction in development builds of Wine 10, is the introduction of kernel module NTsync support. With this, Linux can emulate Windows NT' synchronisation primitives, which might not mean much to you, but minimises latency for demanding games. How much that performance increases by depends on many factors, but we expect a gaming uplift of some kind going forward. Wayland, a display protocol, has seen a handful of improvements in Wine 11, too, with \"shaped and color-keyed windows\" being supported in the experimental driver.

Recent updates promise a complete overhaul to how content is released for the 12-year-old game, shifting to a seasonal pattern that should, the team hopes, make them far more agile. Especially when it comes to nixing quality of life and design bugbears which have been annoying the playerbase for years . I asked executive producer Susan Kath and game director Nick Giacomini how the studio had dealt with these blows and come back seemingly swinging for the fences. And while the response was understandably somber, both studio leads describe the atmosphere at ZeniMax as energised. \"Obviously last year was a tough year for the studio—as you said, for reasons we don't even necessarily need to dig into—but the team has very much rallied,\" Kath explains. \"I see a lot of enthusiasm from the team as we're goi…",

Honestly, I could have watched another hour breaking down the themes and influences of Disco Elysium. Calling it a rich text is like saying Bill Gates has a couple of dollars. According to Helen Hindpere, writer on the original game and lead writer on the Final Cut, Disco Elysium technically has too much writing—at least for Articy, a tool for writing branching stories that Za/um used. \"I think every one of the writers that we had on the team previously had a problem with not writing enough,\" Hindpere says, \"and then for the first time ever the problem became that we were writing too much.

As you can guess, I read a lot of \"yo momma\" jokes and not many legit tips, but I did go looking for corroboration of even outlandish claims, because you never knew.

In addition to the closure of 38 retail outlets, the New Zealand distribution centre will close on February 28. In a note on the EB Games website it's confirmed that access to ebgames.com.au will open to New Zealand customers \"by the end of March 2026\". It's unclear how many jobs have been affected. According to Stockwell's internal memo, the company had received proposals from third parties following early reports of the closure. In the end, \"these parties did not present any proposals or solutions about how to keep the New Zealand business…",

      "body": "As of roughly 2:05 pm EST on Monday, Anthem is really, truly dead . In a world of fan-run private server game resurrections, however, does it have to stay dead? Maybe not. At the end of a lengthy tell-all video about Anthem's legendarily troubled development (via Eurogamer ), former BioWare executive producer and Anthem project lead Mark Darrah indicated that the tech for running Anthem locally once existed—and could, theoretically, exist again. It would, however, rely on either third-party ingenuity or uncharacteristic generosity from EA. I'll let you decide which is more likely. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) Anthem's live service network design had a client-server structure: To play, you and every other player would've had to connect to servers that handled the game's logic. Your PC didn't have to do the thinking. It just had to handle the results and make them look pretty. According to Darrah, however, Anthem actually had code for running locally—meaning players' own machines would host network sessions that other players could connect to—until very late in development. \"Anthem actually had the code for local servers running in a dev environment right up until a few months be…",

Giving a quick glance at some side-by-side screenshots it would be pretty easy to confuse the two, though that's not a huge surprise: Hypixel Studio, maker of Hytale, was founded by Minecraft modders and mappers who decided to create their own voxel game. Besides looks, Minecraft and Hytale have a ton in common: they both take place in \"infinite\" procedurally generated worlds with multiple biomes and deformable terrain, they both feature base-building and gear and weapon crafting, cooking, wildlife and fantasy monsters, and other similar systems. They can both be played solo or in co-op, they both have creative modes, and they're both moddable. And there's blocks. So many, many blocks. So… what's the actual difference between them? Why should you consider trying Hytale if you've already got Minecraft? 1.

It's still a stocky cuboid, but where the Air 540 championed a dual-chamber design that has become the norm for PC cases, the Air 5400 offers a triple-chamber design. Think of it like three distinct zones: there's the main one, for showing off your build; the rear one, with plenty of room for cable management; and a third one, for mounting an all-in-one liquid cooler's radiator inside. The idea behind the third chamber is pretty simple. By mounting the radiator away from other components, and with ample airflow, hot air generated by the CPU can be efficiently expelled from the case and not warm anything around it. It also removes the need for the radiator to block precious fan mounting locations. It's a slick solution. The radiator is mounted toward the front of the…",

With such runaway memory prices, it's hardly surprising that sales of have seen a dip as a result—or that some folks are not even opting for last-gen hardware, but extremely old CPUs to make the most of last-last-gen memory. To be clear, DDR4 memory pricing isn't much more sensible than DDR5; according to TrendForce's latest report , \"the average spot price of mainstream chips (i.e., DDR4 1Gx8 3200 MT/s) has increased by 9.64% from US$25.407 last week (Jan.7) to US$27.857 this week (Jan.14).\" A near 10% price increase in just one week is huge. Understandably, many buyers are opting to hold off on upgrades, resulting in sluggish sales for both DDR5 and DDR4 memory. That's left DDR3 motherboard sales to take centre stage instead, apparently increasing between two and three times in the Chinese DIY market alone. Boards bundled up with 6th to 9th Generation Intel CPUs are apparently also getting a lot more attention (via Videocardz ). Supply has a huge impact on memory pricing. In the aforementioned case of DDR5 memory, there's less to go round in part thanks to the AI industry buying up a whol…",

In an interview on the Joe Vulpis Podcast last week, Perlman made it clear: He doesn't know, he doesn't care, he just wants his 40 bucks and his sandwich. Perlman is a very well known actor, with dozens of television and movie credits going back to the 1970s, but he's also very prolific as a voice actor in animation and videogames. Mobygames lists 33 titles with a Ron Perlman appearance, including Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, Halo 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, and of course the Fallout games. His turns in Fallout are especially interesting because they're his most iconic videogame work, and yet it's only four simple words: \"War. War never changes.\" The intro to each Fallout game spins off differently from there, but those four words are an essential pillar of the series, every bit as thematically foundational as power armor or Nuka Cola. Here's the very first: Perlman lent his voice to those famous four words in every Fallout game from the original to …",

Sure, we were more than a little disappointed by the relentless march of AI announcements , particularly in a show with \"consumer\" in the title, but we still managed to find a host of gaming gear to get excited about. It wasn't the richest of years for PC gamers, but hey, you can't win 'em all. Below, I've listed all nine of our Best of CES 2026 award picks. Despite all the AI tomfoolery, we still managed to scythe our way through the inference stacks, agentic nonsense, and the odd weird sporting tie-in to find gaming gear worth shouting about, and you'll find the cream of the crop right here. We've picked out some exciting new Intel chips, some monitor tech that looks to make a real difference to the way we display our games, a mahoosive graphics card, and much, much more.
