Here we are, howling at the moon for decades-old modes, \"grounded\" character models, classic class setups, and a map from 2011. Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 has impressed me. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year. Place your palm on the pavement, and you can feel the low rumble of a hobby yearning for what we loved 15 years ago: the…",

I knew from the first time I got my hands on it last year that it had the potential to be the kind of game MMO players have wanted for a long time—including me. And Fellowship just kept improving each time I saw it. The pitch is simple: It's MMO-style dungeons but without the MMO grind. You party up in a group of four—one tank, one healer, two damage-dealers—and work together to clear out packs of enemies and bosses for better and better loot. There's no need to level up a character and churn through hundreds of quests. You pick one of the game's MOBA-like heroes, queue up, and spam dungeons for as long as you'd like. It's one of those ideas that I am surprised nobody really capitalized on for this long. There are plenty of World of Warcraft players who play the game purely for the thrill of grouping up and doing dungeons. Fellowship is trying to fill a niche that surprisingly doesn't really exist elsewhere. And that's what drove Chief Rebel to make Fellowship as its first game. Many of its developers came from much bigger studios and saw an opportunity to help make somethi…",

But before that was a halcyon time when Warhammer 40,000 had a reputation for being about wacky warbands rather than epic armies that cost an arm and a leg to acquire. A time when nobody expected you to have the right models because half the things in the rulebook didn't even have models yet. That said, the first edition of Warhammer 40,000 was supposedly a complete mess rules-wise—borderline unplayable without a degree from Wargame University. How true are these things? To find out I dove into the rulebook and played 40K's first edition.

But while Ubisoft said it was \"deeply grateful\" for his impact on the Assassin's Creed games and \"saddened to see him go,\" it was also apparently the company's idea that he leave. \"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it,\" Côté wrote in an emotional, occasionally gutting message posted on LinkedIn . \"The truth is simple: I did not make that choice. \"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.

While Dwarf Fortress history is dense with elaborate defensive superstructures like weaponized magma flows, pits full of war bears, and the trusty dwarven atom smasher , the underlying strategy has been defined by a simple principle: Goblin war hosts can only follow the paths you leave open. As a result, if the only way into your fortress is a meat grinder of boulder traps, sawblades, and entrenched dwarven infantry, goblin besiegers have had no choice but to march headlong into red ruin. Once the siege update lands in a couple weeks, however, invading forces will be leveling the playing field.

Monsters will be meaner and your gear will be more customizable to help you face them. Old systems are returning in new ways and leaderboards are finally back.

      "body": "So, Nvidia's little gold box of pure AI power, the DGX Spark is finally out. But is it any good? The answer depends who's doing the asking and what they're asking of the Spark. By some common measures, it's no faster than another small box based on AMD's Strix Halo chip that's available for about half the price. Ouch. Much of this comes down to the minor matter of floating point math precision. I can feel your eyes glazing over, but bear with me. The finer details aren't that important. All you really need to know is that lowering the floating point precision being used can speed up performance at the cost of eventual AI model accuracy. Oh, and that like all Nvidia hardware based on its latest Blackwell technology, the DGX Spark has special optimisations for the lowest and fastest tier of floating point math, known as FP4. In the simplest possible terms, you'll get better results from your AI model with a higher precision like FP8, but it'll run slower. And a lot slower than a GPU with FP4 optimisations. With all that in mind, how does DGX Spark stack up and how does it compared with AMD's Strix Halo chip? Right out of the, er, little gold box, it's worth noting that a DGX Spark w…",

      "body": "Tomonobu Itagaki has died at the age of 58 following a serious illness. Itagaki was an absolutely transformative figure in contemporary action games thanks to his work at Tecmo, the company he joined in 1992: he led Team Ninja and spearheaded the revival of Ninja Gaiden, as well as creating the Dead or Alive series. He would leave Tecmo under a cloud in 2008, before founding Valhalla Game Studios and releasing Devil's Third on Wii U. Itagaki was known for his sunglasses, pockmarked skin and outspoken interviews, but it was the fact that he and Team Ninja could back up the bluster that made him one of the great creators of the early 2000s. The first 3D Ninja Gaiden, released in 2004, took on Capcom and DMC at its own game and, by my reckoning anyway, beat it handily. That and Ninja Gaiden 2 remain two of the finest hack-and-slash games ever made. The news of Itagaki's death comes from a post to his Facebook page , and PCG has been able to confirm the news via a personal friend of the late developer. That post is titled \"Words to Leave\" and begins, via machine translation: The light of my life is about to run out. The fact that this sentence has been posted means it's finally time. …",

A slight fall at the first hurdle, that, as I'd imagine many beginners wouldn't know the difference between the two. Or even what \"CPU\" might stand for, for that matter.

Most of your rank and file allies have everyday Tactics jobs to earn enough to feed their families fresh Chocobo drumsticks. Over my decades of obsession with this king of strategy RPGs I’ve created a highly scientific system to compare and contrast each and every job across four critical axes: Style : Any dummy can swing a sword, but I need more than that, I need fashion sense . How color coordinated is the job, and does their fit have real chutzpah, or did their mom dress them right out of the fantasy Gap? Shenanigans : Tactics is where we all learn that rules are meant to be broken, and some jobs laugh in the face of convention in favor of rock throwing, teleporting, stat buffing, and ability copying.

Now, I can get a chance to use those gloriously flat and solid little drives with open source project RFIDisk (via Hackaday ). Well, I can do so provided I have a 3D printer. Which I do not—bummer. And if I use Linux, which again I do not ( not anymore , anyway). Still, a man can dream, and this man is dreaming of popping floppy disks into an RFID scanner. Which is what this thing is, by the way: It doesn't actually read the floppy disk, it just fits a floppy disk and scans an RFID code to boot up apps on a connected PC. As the creator ItsDanik explains: \"RFIDisk turns RFID tags into physical shortcuts that launch games, apps, or scripts when inserted on a retro-styled 'floppy drive' reader. Think of it as a cross between an RFID scanner and a USB floppy disk drive.\" RFID means radio frequency identification and is what's used for contactless payments, among other things. The 3…",

And early leaked benchmarks of the chip suggest the new M5 is about twice as fast as the original M1 for single-thread performance. So, the question is, why can't PC CPUs make those kinds of gains? The immediate context here is the accuracy of the leaked benchmark and the actual performance gains of PC processors over the same time period. So, first off, the leaked numbers look plausible. That's because the M4 already had very high single-thread performance and the M5 leaked numbers look to have pushed that on 10% to 15% depending on which precise Apple platforms you are comparing. Now you might dismiss 10% to 15% as your usual generational gain similar to PC chips. And it is. Except Apple is iterating on a nearly annual basis, with the M1 launching in November 2020 and the M5 now with us in late 2025. Intel and AMD tend to take two years to release major new architectures. That more rapid Apple cadence adds up pretty fast as the years tick by. How fast? To put numbers onto this, the M1 does about 2,200 points in Geekbench 6 single-thread , the M5 is looking like aro…",

So, it likely comes as no surprise that I've been pining after the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 headset since it was first announced (ghost type Pokemon are some of my favourites, and it's not just because they often adhere to my carefully curated colour scheme). While I enjoyed my time with the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro , I'm still not a huge fan of the headset's pastel pink 'quartz' colourway. So, when I heard the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is now available outside of Asia , I was there with my Pokeballs at the ready. Obviously, there are a few key differences to note between the V3 Pro and this pretty purple version of the V2. Besides the kitty ears getting swapped out for the ghostie's wee purple horns, the main difference is that the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is a wired headset. That means a stable, constant connection at the risk of forgetting about the wire all together and potentially dragging your rig behind you when you leave your desk…but what sort of Slowpoke would do that, right? The wire itself is contained within a hardy plastic sheathing that could likely withstand a chewing from a deskchair castor (not that I'd recomme…",

Although its brief reveal trailer welcomed us to the new setting, there's now more than enough information for us to sink our teeth into ahead of its release. We already knew Tinkerbell and Snow White would be a part of the DLC as they were shown in the original trailer, but Tigger and Cruella de Vil will now be joining us too. Both will play a significant part in the story, with Cruella essentially taking the role of the villain having left the ranch to decay over time. Tigger, however, will be lost somewhere amongst the new biomes of the map and it will be our job to find him. Unlike the Storybook Vale DLC, Wishblossom Ranch won't be split into parts either so you'll be able to unlock all the characters from day one. Two new horses have also been showcased.

See, present-day Minecraft has a few core principles. The relevant ones to everyone's least favourite critter are \"be fair to players\", \"bad things can happen, but they're technically the player's fault\", \"find the right level of destruction\", and \"don't add features that wreck player's builds.\" If you're sitting here thinking 'hey, wait a second, those are all things that the Creeper does!' then you'd be right. As Chief Creative Officer Jens Bergensten says in the video linked above, \"If you followed the rules we have today, you would probably not add the creeper, because it would actually be so controversial to have a monster that would show up and just destroy what you built.\" However, the \"creeper is very iconic\", which seems in direct conflict with all those lovely pre-established rules.

The results indicate that material created with machine learning tools initially overtook human-written content late last year. However, the data also shows the proportion of AI-generated material plateauing. In fact, the rapid growth of AI content actually begins to slow in the data around mid-2023. Two immediate questions spring from this. First, why is AI content plateauing? Second, how accurate is this study likely to be? Five Percent addresses both of these queries. \"While AI-generated articles grew dramatically after ChatGPT launched, we do not see that trend continuing.

It can feel like running through treacle trying to rank up, level weapons for attachments, and perhaps most painful of all, to complete the many arduous assignments—not helped by a prominent bug causing assignments not to track . Whether through fear of players unlocking everything right away and getting bored, or in an effort to curtail those who would inevitably use Portal as an XP farm , it's not working out well for anyone. Portal servers totally aren't inundated with private bot matches to cheese progression to the point that this creative mode isn't actually serving its purpose. Or at least, that's what I'd say if I were lying.

The Winter Ball will bring Cinderella to the game, one of the characters players have been desperate to invite to their valley since it launched. Even though the roster gets bigger every single year, there's still a pretty significant lack of original princesses, so having updates like this one is always exciting, even though we've still got a couple of months to wait before we get to meet her. The showcase also gave some info on who else will show up as we unlock Cinderella.

Then, it looks like Pocahontas will be joining us in spring, as symbolised by a raccoon sat next to her necklace and a gust of orange leaves.

It's a clever foldable mouse that can be squashed flat to a mere 5 mm thick—but every time I look at the photos and think about holding one, something uncomfortable happens to the back of my neck.

We're still waiting for a new Splinter Cell game and it's been more than a decade since the last one, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, which was released way back in 2013. And even though Ubisoft has confirmed that it's working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell, we haven't heard hardly anything about it in several years. I even took the opportunity to ask Splinter Cell: Blacklist director Guillaume Dousse if he could shed some light on the next Splinter Cell game when we chatted last week, but he regretfully said he didn't have \"the security clearance\" to get us any new info. Ah well, I tried. Dousse, a longtime fan of the Splinter Cell games, will serve as supervising producer on Splinter Cell: Deathwatch Season 2, as well as direct its first episode, according to an email sent to PC Gamer.

I spawned on top of a small castle and picked up some sticks and planks that were lying around, which told me there was crafting. I descended a level and battled some skeletons, so hey, there's monsters. I quickly found a forge, so there's smithing, and a cauldron, so there's cooking. Within a couple minutes I had a magic sword that did poison damage, some armor (wooden, but better than nothing), a shield I'd crafted myself, a couple of potions, a bowl of mushroom stew, and a key to unlock a chest full of loot. That's a promising start. And outside the castle I found my first little airship, so there's flying, too.

Lmao. pic.twitter.com/A0k1I32mRd October 15, 2025 In the last 24 hours, clips have started circulating of players able to gain unparalleled verticality with a kind of bug that makes you wonder, \"What was the person who discovered this even doing?\" Typically, standing on a drone in BF6 doesn't achieve much: As soon as its controller moves it, you'll slide off. But as this clip from Charlie Intel demonstrates on X, standing on a stationary recon drone and clonking it with a sledgehammer causes an almost-definitely-unintended physics interaction that launches the drone and its surfer directly upwards. Because the motion isn't coming from the drone pilot's inputs, the rider is able to keep their footing.

      "body": "The 1995 Mel Gibson film Braveheart, a fictionalized retelling of the battles of Scottish knight William Wallace during the First War of Scottish Independence, was full of blatant historical inaccuracies: Its dates were wrong, its dress was anachronistic, and—worst of all—it didn't even cover the period in Wallace's life when a demonic meteor fell into the heart of Scotland, turning the occupying English forces into an army of corrupted mutants clad in molten, accursed iron. While I'll admit that last bit isn't often acknowledged by historical consensus, it is the basis for Tears of Metal, an upcoming hack-and-slash roguelike with a playable demo on Steam . It's a dark fantasy Dynasty Warriors following a legion of displaced Scots—a combination I didn't know I was missing, but one I'm happy to report is sick. (Image credit: Paper Cult) Tears of Metal's look is its biggest strength. It's decked out in thick, sketchy comic book style, with scribbled highlights and streaks of effect accents punctuating the by-the-dozens dismemberment of hapless English footmen. And the Hades-esque run progression doesn't hurt, either. As you advance from battle to battle as one of Tears of Metal's co…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Okay, PC Gamer test takers, I'm through messing around. Today I'm going to put your brains and fingers to the test with our biggest quiz yet, and this one is all about game genres. According to the list I've pulled from Steamworks and SteamDB, there are over 130 different game genres and sub-genres that have their own tags on Steam. That's a whole lotta genres, so in the fill-in quiz below I've given you a full 15 gosh darn minutes to type as many of them as you can. They're in alphabetical order, which may help, and you can click the hint button if you want some clues. The concept of a genre, and Steam tags in general, can be a bit nebulous, and there are gonna be certain tags you might expect that aren't on the list, like \"VR\" or \"Cozy\" or \"Adult\"—which all sorta feel like they should be genres but are maybe more descriptors. Look, I didn't invent or categorize Steam tags, I just copied them and plopped them into a quiz. How many genres can you guess? Let us kn…",

That's right, Mother Gooseberry and the various other horrors waiting to take you down in each of the game's trials are no longer your only threat. Thanks to the Invasion update coming on October 21, you'll now have to defend yourself against knife-wielding Reagents. If you've spent any amount of time playing already, you've probably already encountered a character that looks exactly like one of your friends. But, upon approaching you, they pulled out a knife and started flailing it in your direction. It's not until they start running the other way that you realise that their gamer tag isn't quite spelt right, and they never responded to your desperate cries asking what they were doing. The Invasion game mode basically takes these encounters and intensifies them, putting real players into each trial rather than NPCs. But, unless you hand-pick it yourself, you won't have to worry about constantly checking over your shoulder in case you're being betrayed, as Invasion is a standalone game mode. If you are…",

Intel will launch a new GPU later next year that's purpose built for AI inferencing . And guess what? It's using that Xe3P graphics architecture. Specs-wise, other than the simple fact that the new GPU, codenamed Crescent Island, is using that next-gen Xe3P technology, there's little to go on. The only other detail is 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory. Actually, that's a relatively revealing spec as it implies this GPU will be a value play, at least in the context of megabucks AI chips. Were it aiming at top-tier AI performance, it would more likely use something along the lines of HBM or High Bandwidth Memory over a huge memory bus. Notably, there's no mention at all of Celestial, the graphics architecture that was supposed to follow Intel's current Battlemage tech , which was previously presented under the Xe3 brand and was equally absent from the Panther Lake launch , despite that chip getting Xe3 graphics. Anyway, Intel says that Crescent Island won't be out …",

Hell, it even runs like a dream . That's not to say the game's entirely without issues, of course, and one persistent grumble since launch has been about Conquest mode, which is arguably the series' 'main' mode and one you'll likely be spending a lot of time in. The problem is time itself: Conquest is a mode designed around each team having a set number of 'reinforcement tickets', which tick down as the match progresses—the first team to run out of tickets loses. Battlefield 6 added a timer to Conquest, something that wasn't present in previous Battlefield games, and so players have run into a repeated issue where matches are finishing before either team has run out of tickets. You can easily see why this is a problem. The great thing about Conquest is comebacks and how a declining ticket count affects your team: players notice when the number's getting low, play more cautiously, and every kill starts to feel…",
