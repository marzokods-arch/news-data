No enemy is safe from the barrage of projectiles that cover the entire screen and hit for billions of damage. Diablo YouTuber Rob2628 showcased the build—which was originally created by a Chinese player on Bilibili —in a recent video. Played optimally, the build can crush the hardest dungeons in the game and speed clear them in minutes. Anyone who has played necromancer before will know how impressive that is for what is normally the slowest class in the game. Technically, the build uses the basic skill Bone Splinters, but that's not the skill you'll be spamming every second. One of the legendary powers you can pick up causes Bone Spirit to launch a volley of Bone Splinters in all directions. You ignore Bone Spirit entirely and just use the skill to fire off hundreds of Bone Splinters. That alone will only tickle monsters, which is why you have to flip on one of season 10's new Chaos Perks, Unstable Power, that makes basic skills always deal massive damage with …",

While that'll be a free addition, a paid add-on will follow with the first Bounty Pack: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day. Like the Headhunter Packs from Borderlands 2, the Bounty Packs will be small additions, with a chain of missions and a boss fight as well as a bunch of themed cosmetics and legendary gear. The story of this one has Rush, the buff lad who runs the Outlanders, trying to keep holiday traditions alive despite the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture, Screw, explicitly restricting seasonal jolliness and cheer.

In pursuit of greater horizons to conquer, the anime action game is going to get its own mode where user-created stuff is king. It's called Miliastra Wonderland and it's such a blatant copy of Roblox that it's funny to listen to people explain it without making the obvious comparison. Instead of playing as your normal gacha-rolled anime characters, you get to customize one of your own and wear outfits unlocked through crafting and the battle pass. You can hang out and emote with other players in an open area called the \"Wonderland Lobby\". In the next major patch, update 6.1, this place will be decorated with jack-o'-lanterns and candles, but I assume it'll change with every season. The main draw of the new mode is all the minigames you can play. There will be a whole Roblox-style catalogue of user-created games spanning several genres, including FPS, roguelike, management sim, and survival. Creators set up the rules and can even include achievements and leaderboards if they want. All of this seems explicitly targeted at the people who may not care about Genshin Impact, but would be down to…",

It won't include the game's full lineup of DLCs, but you can play around with 38 career jobs, the first three Muckingham Files packs, and the Tomb Raider and Midgar special packs. The timing is ideal for anyone looking to foster a budding PowerWash obsession. The game's sequel arrives in less than two weeks on October 23, and when PC Gamer news writer Elie Gould gave it a spin a few months ago, they said it \"seems like something that sets the foundations, rather than breaking new ground.\" If you're the sort to wait while a new game builds itself out with updates and DLCs, it seems like a safe bet that if …",

To my surprise, though, the update wasn't to the matchmaker, but to the ranked badge system. As developer Yoshi put it on the Deadlock Discord: \"Previously, badges were tied to fixed skill ranges on the backend, rather than percentiles. As new players joined and as the distribution shifted over time, it caused badges to clump up in negative ways. You can head over to your profile now to see your rebalanced badge.\" Players did exactly that, of course, and the Deadlock subreddit is ablaze with players who had similar leaps to my own.

Aliens: Colonial Marines is one of the most infamous misfires of gaming history, a disaster of a scale that's relatively rare in the upper echelons of game development. Virtually everyone who played it at the time acknowledged that it was a buggy, broken, unfinished mess, and there were rumblings that Gearbox outsourced large portions of the game's development while it focused on building Borderlands 2. There's been little inclination to reappraise Colonial Marines since, and I'm not really interested in this either. The base game is simply too compromised to attempt some contrived reinterpretation of it as some misunderstood classic. That said, I have occasionally wondered whether Gearbox's ill-fated shooter is wholly beyond redemption, or whether it might find absolution in the collective confession box that is the PC…",

What magic there is inside little rectangles of digital cardboard I don't know, but studios seem to find them irresistible. But do you know what I find irresistible? Turning everything into quizzes! So here we are, with a test of how well you remember your videogame cards. With just one draw each, you'll need to tell us the game's title—and see if you can get all 20 right in just five minutes.

By far and away the best demo I played during those days was for a little game called Sektori . If you haven't heard of Sektori, it's a geometric shoot 'em up in the vein of Housemarque's Resogun and Nex Machina , before they became all about ultra-hard third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros . There's good reason for the similarity. Sektori's creator, Kimmo Lahtinen, worked at Housemarque for 13 years, before departing to pursue his own projects, like a hack 'n' slash game called Barbarian, and a match-3 life sim called Day Repeat Day. Neither of these games made much impact, and I don't know whether they deserved to or not. But I believe Sektori does. Housemarque's lineage oozes from every glowing, spinning polygon. You control a little 3D arrow (known in-game as a 'ship') blasting shapes as they spawn all around a top-down arena. If you get touched by any shape or projectile, the game is instantly over. It sounds almost stupidly simple, but when I jumped into the demo this time last year it revealed its ge…",

But that commitment to authenticity has posed a significant challenge for developer Expression Games for this iteration, one that was equally a problem for the soldiers who actually fought in the war. Vietnam, in case you're not already aware from going there, geography lessons, or ambient exposure to dozens of war movies, is almost half covered by jungle, and was more than half-covered by jungle prior to the Vietnam War. And the thing about jungle is the density of foliage makes it hard to see much else, like the sky, or passing animals, or someone with a rifle trying to murder you. Getting killed outta nowhere is kinda how war rolls, especially from the First World War onward, but it doesn't make for an especially fun or balanced play experience. It's a dilemma that Expression Games has wrestled with for a while, as technical director Kieran D'Archambaud explained in the latest issue of PC Gamer : \"Particularly if you're new to the game, it can be very hard to understand where you're dying from.\" Expression's solution is to …",

Should you still be eeking out the last gasps of a Windows 10 build, there are steps you can take— listed by our Jacob here —to keep the ageing OS on life support, or upgrade a non-supported machine to Windows 11 . But as we watch it slowly ascend to the great operating system repository in the sky, I've been thinking about its legacy. And really, I think the best thing you can say about Windows 10 (among many potential candidates) is that it righted a lot of the wrongs of Windows 8, and for that it should be celebrated. It's easy to forget what a misstep Windows 8 was. Built primarily around the principle that an OS interface should be a hybrid between a touchscreen system and regular ol' mouse and keyboard, it managed to somehow fail at both, resulting in a frustrating experience for desktop users and a halfway house for those trying to make use of its flat, coloured-tile, touchscreen-friendly interface.

While this apparent sequel to Cold Iron Studios' 2021 blaster hasn't been officially announced yet, it has seemingly been rated by the ESRB. As spotted by Gematsu (via PCGamesN ) a listing for Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2 briefly appeared on the website for the ESRB—the US' entertainment ratings body. The page, which has since been taken down, awarded Fireteam Elite 2 a \"Mature\" rating for \"Blood and Gore, Strong Language and Violence\" (sounds like an Aliens game!). The page also mentioned the sequel was being published by Daybreak Games Company (as opposed to Focus Entertainment, the original game's publisher) and that it's coming to PC as well as PS5 and Xboxes large and small. Since games only tend to get rated close to release, this would suggest that a surprise launch for Fireteam Elite 2 is imminent. Of course, the rating could be some weird mistake, but the info that was displayed on the page tracks with rumours surrounding a possible sequel, as well as statements previously made by both Cold Iron and Daybreak.

But perhaps there's another way, one where good design and technical ingenuity can remove some of the sting from system requirements. In a roundabout way, this was recently demonstrated by modder, YouTuber, and mapper Goonya's Animations , who took a map he was making for Half-Life 2 and somehow made it run in Half-Life 1's GoldSrc engine with minimal visual difference. In a video titled \"This is GoldSrc\", Goonya showed off the map in action. The video starts with a run-through of the Half-Life 2 version of the map, which is midway through development. Its handful of corridors includes a room filled with computer terminals and faux-digital displays, and tiled floors with fetching phong-shaded reflections.

When an adventure game like Lone Pine lets me examine a campfire and also a bin, then has the protagonist comment on them in a way that says something about her as well as about the object she's looking at, I know I'm in good hands. Lone Pine is an adventure game about exploring a national park with only your wits and a backpack you can fill with items that might then be combined with each other to solve puzzles. Oh, and a camera for taking photos of cryptids with. Lone Pine National Park contains several undocumented species and it's your job to document them. First you'll have to lure them out, which means learning a little about each one, and then solving a puzzle to get their attention. The photography minigame is surprisingly involved, with shutter speed and aperture to control as well as zoom. It's not complicated enough to be a faff, at least not in the demo I played at PAX Australia, but it makes \"photograph\" a pleasing addition to the short list of verbs Lone Pine gives you. The one thing that gave me pause was a puzzle that I got stuck on because I couldn't match two drawings of a dog's head. One was just a t…",

The Control spinoff shooter FBC: Firebreak stumbled badly at launch, putting up a peak concurrent player count on Steam of just under 2,000 on release day and quickly slumping to under 100 less than a month later. Remedy fired out some quick patches and committed to more significant changes, the first of which went live near the end of September .

Remedy's next quarterly financial report is set for October 29, but it's not waiting until then to deliver the bad news. \"In its 2025 half-year financial report, Remedy reported that FBC: Firebreak’s launch-phase consumer sales underperformed,\" the studio said in today's update . \"After the launch, the company rapidly developed the game based on player feedback and released multiple updates. \"On September 29, Remedy released the first Major Update tit…",

EA is working on a fix, but that's not good enough for Battlefield boss Vince Zampella. In a reply to a spurned fan on X , Zampella gave the sort of recommendation that any reasonable PC gamer would give in this situation: \"Can you refund and buy on Steam?\" Surely yes, they can, but it's a little surprising to hear that from Mr. EA. \"I have yelled about EA App people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?\" he asked in a post higher in the thread. (Image credit: Vince Zampella via X) Is Vince asking us who he should be yelling at to fix this problem? Surely he'd know better than us, but maybe he's just trying to make it as clear as possible that he's miffed. At this point, everyone on this big blue marble knows how badly the EA App sucks.

The good news is that the mod is not at risk of being derailed: Eminoma said it's \"still very much on track for full release,\" and that the effort to get everything ready for the cancelled open beta means it's \"probably in a better spot than we would have been if we never attempted this in the first place.\" But there is also the possibility that something may have to change—specifically, the name of the mod.

It had a theme song, Haruo Minami’s 'Sekai no kuni kara konnichiwa' (Hello from all over the world), which Kojima is a little obsessive about: the song repeats the \"hello\" refrain many times as well as talking about humanity \"holding hands\" across borders. It's actually a bit of a bop . \"When the Expo opened, I had just finished elementary school,\" writes Kojima . \"I was able to visit the site many times. I went there dozens of times [...] At the Soviet Pavilion, I waited in line for over two hours, with a line stretching around the perimeter. Unfortunately, the American Pavilion, where I was hoping to see the 'moon rock', was too crowded, and I missed it.\" Remember that m…",

There is no more perfect day-one demonstration of what Portal can do than this surprisingly good remake of Call of Duty 4 Shipment by game dev Matavatar , who had a working version of the map up a day before Battlefield 6 was even live (EA released the Portal editor a bit early). I played a few minutes of Matavatar's Shipment in a server someone had going and, yep, they pretty much nailed it. Because of how Portal works at the moment, the map itself was actually suspended in the air somewhere in the skybox of Operation Firestorm, which is giving early Portal creations a Halo Forge-y feel (which I mean in a complimentary way). It's kind of wild that EA is letting people not only host custom maps from the jump, but even earn XP from playing in them.

Take a bow Saint Riot, a streamer who mainly focuses on FromSoftware games but has taken a break with the (excellent) remake of Final Fantasy Tactics, and dared to ask the big question: do chocobos believe in god? Well… do they? To briefly explain: one of the character stats in FFT is faith, which is a double-edged sword that measures a character's faith in the divine as a percentage. A higher faith stat means their magic attacks are more effective, but they also take more damage from magic. The important thing here though is that, if a character's Faith score hits 95 and stays there, that character will leave your party to go find god. One more thing. The Orator class can use an ability called Beast Tongue to take control of a monster (such as a chocobo) and use it in battle, and the creature will level up.

Not because he's precious about you hearing his game's lovely words, but because \"skipping dialog could lead to broken mission states that might not be recoverable.\" Turns out all that nattering is holding something up, and that something is important. While other games might have dialogue-skip functions with hardly a problem, the way BL4 works means that \"This request is way more involved and riskier that it appears on the surface with how dialog is integrated within our mission system\".

As I write this, the game sits at a current and all-time peak of 521,000 concurrent players. I think most of them are in a queue. Queues, like hell, do the numbers. This is quite impressive, and I imagine is just the kind of thing that DICE and, less salubriously, EA wanted to see when it hit the big red launch button on its latest entry in the series. I wasn't kidding when I said I think most of them are in a queue. At time of writing, Battlefield community hotspots mostly consist of competitive queue-posting. 'There are 417,000 people ahead of me!' boasts one . 'There are 458,000 ahead of me!' ripostes another . The good news is that queues appear to be moving quick. It's no surprise.

But in case you've wondered about some of the broader design choices that went into the last couple of generations plus the upcoming one, Intel's just answered why these CPU cores are the way they are. Well, at least in one respect, that is, this is being why simultaneous multithreading (SMT) was abandoned. In a recent interview with Chips and Cheese , Intel's lead x86 CPU architect Stephen Robinson tells interviewer George Cozma that \"SMT isn't necessarily as valuable\" once you add hybrid cores into the mix. Intel has been using hybrid cores—a mix of P-Cores for heavy workloads and E-Cores for lighter ones—for the past few years, ever since 12th Gen Alder Lake processors. Initially, these had multithreading. But the most recent Lunar Lake mobile and Alder Lake desktop chips—the first ones other than Meteor Lake to use the 'Core Ultra' nomenclature—ditched SMT altogether. This trend is continuing with upcoming Panther Lake processors: they won't have SMT. Robinson explains that…",

And yet, Sawyer believes job security for himself as well as other devs is worse than ever before despite his current position, as well as shipping so many well-respected titles over the years, \"In 26 years, I’ve never really felt secure in a job. Even now. Less so now, actually\", he tells the audience during a keynote at GCAP , a game development conference in Melbourne, Australia. \"That’s actually pretty messed up\" he adds, almost as though he’s realising it upon saying it out loud. The games industry is a vastly different space than it was 26 years ago when Sawyer began.

Essentially, you make the product, you should be forced to use it—which Graphite apparently enacts by randomly deleting employee accounts on a daily basis, a process it refers to as \"onboarding roulette\".

Anyway, the whole idea is to test the onboarding process for its AI code review software, a traditionally difficult problem to solve due to the userbase being your primary test subjects. Fear not, however, as apparently dogfooding is the way forward.

Snipers can set up their own little spot and plink away, enjoying the atmosphere of the battlefield while ideally not drawing too much attention. The best BF6 M2010 ESR loadout is very different to its other weapon counterparts, where recoil control is one of the most important things. Instead, this setup focuses on adding handy tools to the rifle that speed up round rechambering, but also reduce weapon sway so you can land a long-range shot with more precision.

      "body": "The L110 is the starter LMG (or light machine gun) in Battlefield 6 , and as you'd expect, it's capable of spitting out an absolute storm of bullets before having to reload. The best BF6 L110 loadout is all about trying to control that torrent of projectiles, shackling the gun with some recoil control, while trying to keep it competitive with a fast aim down sight speed. The LMG is a bit of a weird gun in Battlefield 6, trumped at close range by SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines, but also at longer range by DMRs. So what does the L110 have going for it? Well, it's got a whole lot of bullets for one. While your opponent's mag might run dry quickly, you'll still be blasting away. If you can keep it accurate, it also has a decent TTK, especially if you manage to land headshots with the Hollow Point ammo I'm recommending. If you're using an LMG as Support (which you should be), you'll also get additional bonuses to ADS and sprint speed, helping to make things a tad more competitive. Best L110 loadout in Battlefield 6 (Image credit: EA) Here's the build I've been using for the L110: Muzzle: Compensated Brake (20) Barrel: 465MM LB (10) Underbarrel: Stippled Stubby (35) Magazine: 100RND…",

      "body": "Battlefield 6 has a whopping 45 weapons to unlock across all its categories (including sidearms), so you're spoilt for choice—plus, they can be used on any class in standard Open Weapons playlists. It's a big improvement over the measly launch offerings of BF1, BF5, and BF2042, and it makes progression significantly more rewarding. With so many weapons to unlock, both through career ranks and assignments, it's a no-brainer to sort the wheat from the chaff to find out the best guns . So, I've put every weapon to the test, including playing around with attachments, to help you out in the field. Best Battlefield 6 guns The best guns I've used so far in BF6 are: M4A1 (rank 2, carbine) M87A1 (rank 0, shotgun) PW7A2 (rank 19, SMG) DRS-IAR (rank 9, LMG) M277 (rank 11, carbine) SG 553R (Danger Close assignment, carbine) M4A1 The M4A1 carbine, unlocked at just Rank 2, is one of the best weapons in the entire game. Thanks to its high fire rate and solid damage, the M4A1 is capable of dropping enemies blazingly fast. Now, you might think that these positives must mean the M4A1 is weak at range. It should be, but it's not. With just a converter and vertical grip, you can negate most of the re…",
