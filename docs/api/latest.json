And the market just might have something to react to with this story: a woman has been arrested by London's Met Police for stolen bitcoin valued at—gulp—$6.7 billion or thereabouts. The woman, Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, also allegedly known as \"the goddess of wealth\" by some, plead guilty to two counts in Southwark Crown Court, related to the acquisition and possession of criminal property (via BBC News ). The assets in question: 61,000 bitcoin. 61,000 x 113,000 = 6.893 billion dollars. The value has shifted a little since the Met made its calculations, but that's bitcoin for you. Six months ago a single bitcoin was worth less than $100,000. Six years ago it was around $3,000. Qian is said to have received the bitcoin from large-scale fraud in China, with over 128,000 victims pouring their cash into Qian's investments. Qian then stored the stolen assets in bitcoin, which has had a pretty good year. Qian is then said to have moved to the UK and attempted to launder the assets by purchasing property with assistance from a…",

It got a pretty big \"Cartel Update\" back in August and has now hit the Steam Autumn Sale with a juicy 30% discount. Despite the goofy-looking characters, we clocked early on that Schedule 1 isn't just a meme game and that it totally gets around the crafting game malaise by turning crafting into fun minigames . There's your free talking points for any friends who skipped the initial wave on this one who you may be able to twist into getting it on sale. It's me; I'm the friend in the group chat who missed it and is feeling a bit tempted by the discount. You can snag Schedule 1 on Steam for $14/£11.72 until the Autumn Sale closes next week on October 6, which isn't bargain bin but is a nice cut out of the $20 it normally goes for.

And it's also the latest step in the Saudi Arabian Investment Fund's mission to \"sportswash\" the brutal regime, by using its influence and ubiquity across entertainment industries to distract from some of the world's most appalling human rights abuses. As the crack team at PCG towers discussed the deal, one line stuck with me: \"I wouldn't want to be sitting in a BioWare chair right now.\" The vibes around one of the all-time great RPG studios have not been good in recent years, and the fairly decent Dragon Age: The Veilguard didn't persuade anyone that the studio is capable of surpassing contemporary greats like Baldur's Gate 3 or Disco Elysium.

That was a bit of a disaster, to the extent the developer immediately went through a round of layoffs . Another departure was Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar who left in 2020 to establish Absurd Ventures, which is so far living up to the name by releasing a graphic novel, an audio drama, a novel, and recently announcing the Absurdaverse . Before leaving Rockstar, Houser was a lead writer on every GTA game since GTA London 1969 (released in 1999), and with GTA5 first releasing in 2013 it's not unreasonable to think he may have had some involvement there. Not so. In a new interview with IGN Houser says he had no involvement with GTA 6: \"They're always a new story. It's not going to be a story I wrote or a character set that I developed, but I think it's going to be exciting.

Autumn has in fact been here for a week, as the good ol' Farmer's Almanac tells us, but the seasonal shift matters today more than most other days because today also marks the beginning of the 2025 Steam Autumn Sale . 'Now, hold on,' I hear you say. 'It's far too early for such things—Steam Autumn Sales don't roll around until the end of November!' And historically, yes, this is true: The 2024 sale began on November 27, the 2023 Autumn Sale arrived on November 21, and the 2022 edition came our way on November 22. Well, things have changed. Valve said back in February that the Autumn Sale would fire up a couple months early for 2025: It didn't say why, but the obvious guess is to put more room between it and the Steam Winter Sale: In previous years, the big year-ending blowout would kick off just a couple weeks after the end of the Autumn Sale, and that's just not enough time between two of the biggest videogame sales of the year. For the first time ever... the Steam Autumn Sale arrives during the early days of Autumn! In the Northern Hemisphere, at least.

This week I've been: continuing to play way too much Borderlands 4 and waiting for Battlefield 6. One thing that surprised me from the Battlefield 6 beta back in August was that Battlefield Studios seemed to be aiming for a more casual, fast-paced experience. Smaller maps are one thing, but the remarkably frictionless weapon handling seriously ramped up the speed of shootouts and all but removed the need to tap or burst fire at longer ranges. Simply by slapping a single-port brake or the basic folding vertical grip on any weapon would immediately resolve any recoil issues. In this way, the Battlefield 6 beta felt an awful lot like a battle royale—Call of Duty Warzone being the elephant in the room—in which weapons are highly efficient at way further ranges than they really should be. It was a shame, considering Battlefield has long prided itself on being more realistic/grounded/authentic (you name it) than Call of Duty. It's also ironic, given that Battlefield 6 will actually have a battle royale component, and I've no doubt this more streamlined weapon handling was designed with…",

He wants everybody in the world to be built on American technology.\" But China has been busy, accelerating its own AI infrastructure plans with a reported mandate that its domestic data centres source at least 50% of their chips from similarly domestic manufacturers to avoid a reliance on US-made tech.

On stage at the ongoing Zurich Film Festival, Van der Velden told interviewers that \"When we first launched Tilly, people were like, 'What’s that?', and now we’re going to be announcing which agency is going to be representing her in the next few months.\" Per Van der Velden, Hollywood is abuzz with Tilly-mania, and producers all over tinsel-town can't wait to do something with her. It. Her. I'll believe it when I see it. 'Everyone is very excited about the thing I'm selling' is less evidence than I need to believe AI actors are about to start engulfing our favourite shows, and if that AI Commissioner sketch shows anything, it's that these things still have a ways to go before they don't across as eerie and …",

Curry actually made a similar announcement almost exactly a year ago, releasing a video in which she announced there would be \"no more gaming videos\" from her—in effect, that she was retiring from the Let's Play life. But the following December, Curry felt the Skyrim urge once more and returned to the game, and even fired up Oblivion Remastered in May to check out Cyrodiil for the first time. So it's entirely possible that Curry might change her mind once again, and have a second come-to-Todd moment after a well-earned rest much like she did before. But I wouldn't put any bets down to that effect. Curry sounds tired, and in particular she doesn't seem to be getting the things she wants from her Skyrim uploads. \"I have a few older regular viewers\", Curry said, \"but most of them seem to be very young k…",

Capcom and Square Enix teamed up during Tokyo Game Show this weekend to show off a little more of the crossover. Monster Hunter: Wild's half is out right now—with hunters able to take on Omega Planetes—while Final Fantasy 14 joins the party on October 7 with The Windward Wilds trial that lets Warriors of Light face off against Arkveld. Even skimming through Final Fantasy 14's portion of the showcase this weekend, the encounter with Arkveld felt considerably more MMO-y than Monster Hunter. Which sounds daft, but not so much when you compare it to the game's previous collaboration with World which introduced a fight against Rathalos. While it was still quite MMO-like—it was literally in Final Fantasy 14, after all—it felt like there was a real concerted effort to integrate as much Monster Hunter madness as it could.

Creative director Graeme Timmins has already agreed as much, noting the infamous knives \" will get addressed \", alongside some unintentional interactions and broken builds, very soon. For those living under a rock, the Penetrator Augment that can drop on throwing knives causes all damage dealt to the target to become guaranteed critical hits for a short duration. With almost any build, especially those specced into bonuses with critical hits or status effects like the bleed Vex build , this short window is more than long enough to burst down any boss in the blink of an eye. Plus, you can also get the Damage Amp Payload effect, which—in the same vein as Penetrator—causes the target to simply take increased damage for a duration. In fact, you can even get these two bonuses together if you're lucky for guaranteed critical hits and a flat increase in damage…",

      "body": "Epic has pulled the Peaceful Hips emote from Fortnite—created as part of a collaboration with James Gunn's DC show Peacemaker—after the latest episode's bombshell painted the dance in a pretty damning new light. Warning: spoilers ahead for the latest episode of Peacemaker! The emote comes from the second season's opening dance sequence, where John Cena's character stiffly flails his arms before following up with a cheeky little hip thrust. With no context it could be excused as a silly goofy routine, but Peacemaker's latest episode came with a huge revelation that all but confirms the meaning behind the move. It turns out the seemingly perfect alternate dimension Peacemaker has been hanging around in is actually one where America lost to Hitler in World War 2. Essentially, he's accidentally found himself in Nazi utopia, exclusively populated by white people and where the American flag's stars have been exchanged for a swastika. Peacemaker’s dance emote from Fortnite has been disabled.“As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days.” pic.twitter.com/hwHqOiid1o September 28, 2025 Goin…",

      "body": "Battlefield 6's official launch is just over a week away, and while most players are counting down the seconds, some are revelling in the latest official live-action trailer that seems to poke fun at a certain competing FPS franchise. The trailer starts with a bunch of celebrities: Zac Efron, Jimmy Butler, Morgan Wallen, and Paddy Pimblett gearing up for a fight, but sadly, they don't really get too far as they're blown to bits in just a couple of seconds. This is followed by an unknown soldier asking, \"Who was that?\" as another soldier replies, \"Doesn't matter, let's move.\" I was pretty relieved when I saw these celebrities get blown up. It's not like I've got anything against them, but seeing a Battlefield 6 trailer with guest stars didn't fit the vibe that I thought Battlefield Studios was going for with this latest game. One of the biggest fears many players have had throughout the lead-up to Battlefield 6 was that it would unceremoniously morph into Call of Duty at some point, be that by adding ridiculous skins or with weird collabs that are out of place in its gritty battleground. So blowing up Zac Efron and co may seem like a bit much, but it has worked wonders in quelling …",

Not me, though. Not because I love Windows 11, but because I'm still miffed about something that happened 10 years ago: the death of Windows 7. Now that was an operating system with hair on its chest. And for dedicated enough users, it turned out it never truly died at all. As YouTuber ChrisPro recently found out, you can even run Silksong on Win7 with some elbow grease and a can-do attitude. Okay, to be fair, it's not an easy process. Steam stopped officially supporting Win7 as recently as January 2024, which means even getting the client running is a headache. ChrisPro had to root around in their Steam install and kill off a couple of dll files to trick the client into booting. Once it did, the entire experience had an ominous red message reading \"Steam will stop running on Windows 7 in 0 days\" looming over it. Then,…",

They're just names and hit points. The sidequests squeeze in some of the personality the main questline leaves out, and even (whisper it) reference the occasional meme.

If my memory serves me right, it was around 11 years ago that we first entered the PC market with Yakuza 0,\" recalled Yokoyama. \"Until then, we had only released our games on PlayStation, and they were exclusively in Japanese, made specifically for the Japanese market. \"The Yakuza series itself was originally created with the concept of 'Japanese people making a game for Japanese people,' so we never imagined it would be accepted globally. But once we properly localized the language and created an environment where players around the world could enjoy it, the PC market embraced it in a big way. That acceptance helped our studio grow and pushed us toward globalization.\" Yakuza 0 on PC was certainly my introduction to the series, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio finally bridged that gap with some of its finest work.

Tom's Hardware spotted numerous eBay listings for the Xbox Ally X priced as high as $2,500. For context, the MSRP is $999 for the Xbox Ally X or $599 for the base Xbox Ally.

At the time of writing, pre-orders are still open for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X at Best Buy , Asus , and Microsoft (if you're outside the US, you can check the official Xbox pre-order page to find pre-order options in your region). This is a pretty pricey handheld as it is, all things considered, so don't let a scalper trick you into paying double.

      "body": "I have been excited for very few videogames the way I'm excited for Absolum. Guard Crush won my heart when it dropped Streets of Rage 4 , a beat 'em up so fluid and skill-expressive it approaches the zenith of the genre, and so I was floored when I tried Absolum during Steam Next Fest earlier this year and felt it had the potential to be even better. Part of that I attribute to its original fantasy world where it feels like the devs, unshackled by the aesthetic constraints of a 20-year-old series, were able to make something far more grandiose than grimy streetfights. Who better, then, to bang out the soundtrack than Yuka Kitamura, mastermind behind the tunes of Elden Ring and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice? A studio recording was revealed during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, interspersed with some new clips of the game's combat. It's all snarling strings and portentous vocal melodies, and given that it's performed by a live orchestra, it's a level of production value the sidescrolling beat 'em up is treated to less often than I'd like. Stylistically, it's perfect for what you'd expect from musical backing in a fantasy videogame. The boss footage is no slouch either, and only ma…",

You play as not one cyberninja, but three (which I guess makes this a characters action game), and when PC Gamer news writer Elie Gould checked out a preview build at Gamescom, they said their expectations were \"blown out of the water within the first five minutes.\" Morbid Metal is a roguelike spectacle fighter developed by Screen Juice and published by Ubisoft where you carve through procedurally generated stages, piecing together custom combos and slapping on upgrades as you go. Also clock that style meter in the top right; this is a game that takes after Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. The triple threat character setup means you can launch an enemy into the air with one character, switch to another, and send them crashing back down in a matter of seconds. Morbid Metal was slated for an early access launch earlier this year before it got delayed, though there's still a demo you can try on its Steam page . The game resurfaced at today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct with a new trailer complete with screaming djent guitars and a call for playtest signups. I'm eager to see how it shapes up, in early access and beyond. I …",

Unfortunately, my poems aren't good enough to get me room and board anywhere. But, in Oku, I can leave this life behind and live out that fantasy, traversing gorgeous Japanese landscapes while meeting and helping strangers. In a new trailer unveiled today during the PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, we get our first look at the NPCs you'll be helping. You'll meet Tea Practitioner Nami, a white cat called Taiko, and a disgruntled fisherman. The gang's all here. You play as a monk who can literally ride the wind, using the clouds as platforms to walk on or skimming across the water gracefully. Meeting a talking cat doesn't seem so farfetched now. We also see more of the poem-making in action. You'll get to craft haikus based on the environment around you. So, when you encounter the fisherman, you can try to cheer him up by choosing from a list of words you've gathered and making the best verse you can think of. You need to pick the right adjectives and nouns to capture the moment. It reminds me of Chants of Sennar, where you have to figure out which words and symbols wor…",

In D-topia, you play as a Facilitator who helps an AI run the perfect city. Residents of the city of D-topia have their lives carefully curated by a benevolent artificial intelligence to ensure they all stay happy, but a human touch is still required from time to time. I'm sure there are absolutely no sinister undertones that will emerge the further into the game you get. The trailer we saw during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct shows off the game's easy-going puzzles and troubled residents of D-topia. Despite living in paradise, people still have their problems and anxieties. How you choose to help is up to you. You can make choices that conform with the rules of the society at large, or you can try to appease people on a more personal level. So, don't let the soft aesthetics fool you, this isn't an entirely cozy game—your choices matter and will affect the lives of the citizens you meet.
