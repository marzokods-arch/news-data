In a recent interview with our colleagues at GamesRadar , Galante said the years that followed his unforeseeable success have left him with a blunt assessment of the games industry: \"I see a lot of publishers I don't like,\" Galante said. (Image credit: poncle) Today, Vampire Survivors studio Poncle now boasts over 25 staff members and—as of last November—has started its own publishing division , Poncle Presents. Galante told GamesRadar that he wants to offer an alternative to \"publishers that try to exploit the platforms just to make money.\" \"My point of view for what a publisher should do is, first of all, make genuine games, genuine products, something that has some real value, and then understand that not everything can be a breakout hit,\" Galante said.

It's been less than a week since the co-op FPS came out and we already have a build that goes infinite. The build, which I discovered through YouTuber NickTew , involves using a particular throwing knife in combination with a passive skill for Vex to overload enemies with critical hits, and if you want to try it, you should probably try it now, as it seems like the kind of thing that's too broken not to be patched out eventually. The entire build revolves around throwing knives that cause your normal damage to become critical damage. You can find the \"Penetrator Augment - Damage\" stat on any Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife in the game and it'll work regardless of the item's level. NickTew's character is level 50 and his level 35 knife works because the stat is the same no matter what. Vex has a passive skill called Bloodletter that gives your guns a chance to apply a bleed damage over time effect. That bleed will deal critical hits when combined with the throwing knife, which is a lot of damage on its own. But where this goes infinite is w…",

'Proper' office furniture can easily cost double that of the best gaming chair , and sometimes even more than that. Right here I have my bottom parked on a Humanscale Freedom Headrest task chair, and it's a serious grown up chair. And it's also $2000. I guess, in the sort of office where you've spent at least that much on your pink iMac and the same again on some beautifully engineered 'executive toy', that sort of outlay to support your spine and sooth your buttocks makes sense. But can we justify that as a PC gamer? Honestly, this PC gamer cannot. But this isn't a chair that was really designed for me, though it certainly feels like it from the way it cradles my body as I'm sat at my desk right now. I've been using this chair for months, and have been loving it.

Despite writing an article about the reaction to Nvidia's brutal optimised settings charts for Borderlands 4, and being well aware of stuttering issues thanks to Nick's performance testing piece, I jumped into the game this weekend anyway. And, lo and behold, the stuttering was very much there—until I discovered a fix that's virtually eliminated the issue on my machine. It's not my own discovery, in fact, but that of YouTuber Ki11er Six , who posted a review of the game along with a crucial performance tip a few days ago. On Nvidia graphics cards, it's possible to manually adjust the shader cache size in the Control Panel—which Ki11er Six suggests should be set to 100 GB to prevent stuttering. (Image credit: Nvidia) To perform the fix yourself, first make sure the game isn't running. Then, simply right-click on your desktop, hit \"Show more options\" (depending on how you've got your Windows context menus set up), open the Nvidia Control Panel, and navigate in the side panel to \"Manage 3D settings.\" From there, scroll down in the Global Settings tab to Shader Cache Size, use the drop-down menu to select 100 GB, and hit Apply.

Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on. Bearing that in mind, Pitchford goes on to say that \"0.04% of customers [tickets] are PC performance related.\" The number gets smaller. Of that 0.04% o…",

You might remember how, ten or twenty hours back, you fought a positively painful gauntlet at Craw Lake in Greymoor. Well, it seems like the birds want a rematch, and the Craw Summons is how you access it. I'll explain the likely conditions for spawning the Craw Summons and where exactly you'll need to use it to bash some birds again. How to get the Craw Summons in Silksong The Craw Summons appeared for me in Far Fields after I completed The Dark Below quest in Act 3 (Image credit: Team Cherry) The Craw Summons is an item that will appear next to a bench you've spawned near during Act 3 —it looks like a bit of parchment hanging from a nail driven into the ground. I've seen a lot of different speculations about what causes this item to appear.

Preparing for the release of Wheatflour Wonderland will also prevent any unnecessary obstacles getting in the way of your budding friendship with Cogimyun, the game's newest character. Since friendship progression is limited to how much you can craft per day, anyone looking to blast through the new set of friendship quests will want to give themselves a headstart.

Point being, a first gaming laptop is a momentous event, so can the Erazer Scout rise to the occasion? Well, the first major caveat to get out of the way is that this sub-brand of German consumer electronics company Medion (which itself is a member of the Lenovo group) does not currently sell outside of the UK and Europe. So, US-based readers looking longingly at that budget price tag are out of luck, I'm afraid. The second thing to bear in mind is that this gaming laptop contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 mobile GPU, an entry-level chip that, in desktop form, only promises performance comparable to the RTX 4060 , though you do get DLSS 4.

I can't claim all the credit; the Asus ProArt PA401 is a gem. The wood finish down the front panels, the all-black interior, and the clever switches that make it a breeze are all to thank for that. Now I do realise the irony of saying less is more and placing two sticks of G.Skill's finest gold-plated, faux-crystal RAM sticks in there, but they don't look anything near as garish as they sound. This is an all-AMD gaming PC; my slight obsession with using the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in full force here. It's a powerful gaming chip for a reasonable price—3D V-Cache working a treat for improving frame rates. If you wanted to improve further, you could opt for the 16 cores of …",

The studio's been spotted (by The GTA Base on X) counting its chickens before they've hatched in a recent job posting for a lead software engineer. \"With the continued growth of Grand Theft Auto Online and the upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto 6,\" Rockstar prognosticates that \"the successful candidate will lead both the evolution and operation of the data platform supporting what will be the largest game launch in history, ensuring it scales to deliver an exceptional experience for millions of players worldwide.\" Now, look, don't get me wrong. Predicting that GTA 6 will be the biggest videogame ever feels a little like predicting the Sun will rise in the east and set in the west, but I can't help but find it amusing that Rockstar is willing to talk about it like it's already established fact a full seven months out from the game's release.

Next week, pro golfers from across Europe and the United States will duke it out for the Ryder Cup. The international golfing tournament has been won by the Europe team in seven out of the previous 10 times, though the Europeans have failed to win on US soil since 2012. The next Ryder Cup will take place at the Bethpage Black Course in Farmingdale, New York. So, the pressure is on. Home team advantage is at play here, and a part of that is the intensity of the crowds. As someone with only a mild interest in swinging a club at my local club's driving range, I can only imagine how much more I'd whiff it if there were hundreds, if not thousands, of angry fans calling me a sweaty, lanky ****head every time I swung.

One enlightening subject is writer and quest designer Mark Nelson, who was responsible for a chunk of Morrowind's expansions, Tribunal and Bloodmoon, as well as fleshing out the starter village of Seyda Neen. He's the guy responsible for Tarhiel, the wizard who memorably falls out of the sky in front of you the moment you leave, for instance. And he's also the one to blame for The Lusty Argonian Maid , a tiny joke text that's become a core part of the Elder Scrolls' identity.

Cutscenes were wonky as all get-out, with characters not appearing where they were supposed to (if at all), and sometimes sliding into or out of frame as if they were on rollerskates. Cutscene audio often crackled, making dialogue sound cheap and staticky. There were graphical problems too, with resolution options I would charitably call \"limited\" and water that turned black at a distance. It wasn't a great port, it was just a great enough game that I could overlook those and other flaws. There have been multiple attempts to improve Saints Row 2's PC port over the years, and the latest is the most impressive. Called Saints Row 2 Juiced, it fixes all the problems I mentioned in the previous paragraph and more.

Meanwhile, there are people not only no-hitting the game's hardest bosses, one true student of the needle has no-hit every boss in the game. This early Silksong champion is CrankyTemplar on YouTube, who also appears to have done a lot of Hollow Knight 1 challenge content previously. CrankyTemplar uploaded a first no-hit compilation of Silksong's early bosses the day it came out, releasing subsequent addendums over the following days. CrankyTemplar put out a crowning, nearly two hour-long supercut of beating every boss without taking damage on Thursday, September 11⁠—exactly one week after the game released. For a game widely agreed to be extremely challenging, one that PCG contributor Tyler Colp called \"worth the pain\" in his 90% review of Silksong , I find this to be a staggering accomplishment for how quickly CrankyTemplar managed it. With Silksong being such a massive game, CrankyTemplar does caveat that this \"should\" be every boss in the game, but the list looks exhaustive to me: They even…",

The clip shows Geralt, an elf, and a dwarf squaring off with a wraith in a dark forest. Dialogue-wise, we just get a little of that Witcher pre-fight monster explaining, the sort of thing Geralt would mutter while looking at clues, but Hemsworth hits the right notes with a similar growl to original Geralt actor Henry Cavill. The choreography of the fight is also physical and legible in a way I dig: Not so many cuts that you can't tell what the hell's going on, and some actually interesting flow to it. The fight's dominated by the specter knocking Geralt over and trying to drag him back to its crypt, before he jams his sword in the ground to slow it and then Aards his way to freedom. Rounding out some fun deployment of Witcher signs, Geralt lures the thing into a Yrden trap so he can actually harm it⁠, and finishes it off by tearing out its heart a…",

I've always thought of them as entirely separate stories, but Quake 2's latest official episodes—the Machine Games-developed Call of The Machine —explicitly connects the two, with the episode's primary antagonist summoning several Shamblers from the first game to attack the player. This overlap serves as the primary inspiration for Call of the Void , a fanmade Quake 2 episode that takes place after Call of The Machine. This episode throws together Quake 1 and 2's menagerie in much more literal fashion, splicing the roster of both games to create an army of monstrous hybrids. The episode consists of five \"huge\" new maps that mix \"new and old scenarios from both franchises\". Whether this means the maps are inspired by or directly based upon levels from the first two Quake games is unclear. What is clear, weirdly for a Quake game, is the plot.

Such is the case with Keep Digging , which lifts the premise of DoubleBee's surprise hit A Game About Digging A Hole , er, wholesale, opens up its shovelling shenanigans for up to eight players, then rests its hard hat over its eyes for a wee nap while the cash rolls in. Like DoubleBee's burrowing sim, Keep Digging sees players break ground using basic tools like spades and pickaxes, which they use to unearth valuable ores and treasures. These can be sold to purchase more advanced equipment like dynamite, wire rope, and batteries. I presume the latter are used to power some other excavation device, but the Steam page just reads \"batteries\" so it isn't clear.

No, the reason for their familiarity is far more interesting: a good chunk of the game's score includes rearranged songs from my favourite PC rhythm game. Welcome to Soundtrack Sunday, where a member of the PC Gamer team takes a look at a soundtrack from one of their favourite games—or a broader look at videogame music as a whole—offering a little backstory and recommendations for tracks you should be adding to your playlist. Neowiz is also the studio behind the DJMax series—starting off as an Asia-exclusive online PC game before moseying off to PlayStation for a number of years, finally returning to desktops in 2020's DJMax Respect V. The game's music library is chock full of tracks, from original pieces to collaborations with other games like League of Legends and Tekken.

If you haven't braved Arma 3's hyper realistic battlefields, now might be the time to do so. The game is currently 90% off, making it cheaper than a cup of coffee. The discount is part of Bohemia Interactive's Steam publisher sale , which has most of the Czech studio's cheaper than usual. Arma 3 for $3 (£2.50) is by far the best deal of the bunch, though. The single-player campaign, which was released over a period of three years, is pretty strong. But really it's the multiplayer where Arma 3 is at. Whether you're playing ops with friends, building your own scenarios, or getting involved with RP servers like Arma life , it has tons of different experiences to offer.

Their most powerful skill is Hypnotic Gaze, which lets them strip opponents of their tackle zones and prevent them using skills like block and dodge. It works on a 2+, rather than 3+ under the old rules in Blood Bowl 2, though it's modified by -1 for each marking player. Hypnotic Gaze is a great way of bypassing blockers and busting cages, but it's balanced by the Bloodlust rule. Every bloodsucker has to pass a test before they act, and if they fail they bite someone else on your team—which is why the handful of useful vampire players have to be bulked out with a mob of thralls who exist just to be snacked on. Playing as the Vampires can be infuriating, as a few bad Bloodlust rolls will see you injuring your own players faster than your opponent can (there's no armor roll for your thralls when they get bit).

To that end, they used a corridor on the way to Nox in the Deepnest area of Hallownest, and part of the path to Pinmaster in the Blasted Steps of Pharloom. The Blasted Steps corridor had a 12.5% taller pixel count than the Deepnest one in-game, so Karmyuh scaled Pharloom's map up based on that difference. I've included Karmyuh's side-by-side comparison of the two in the gallery below after a l…",

      "body": "If you haven't played two of the best Star Wars games yet, now's your chance to do it cheap. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor are both on sale on Steam at a steep discount through September 23. Fallen Order is 75% off, bringing it down to just $10, and Survivor is 80% off, taking it down to $14. The deluxe version of Survivor is only 70% off, but that still makes it just $26. Both of these games are a bargain at those prices, especially considering they're among the best games in the Star Wars franchise, at least in my opinion. If you enjoy soulslikes, it's definitely worth giving Fallen Order a try. It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire. While Jedi: Survivor isn't perfect, and had a rocky start at launch, it has a solid story and…",
