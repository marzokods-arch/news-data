It's happening, obviously, but has Ubisoft actually said so? Apparently it has not—yes, I checked—but it has, as PC Gamer wordsmith Joshua Wolens put it in September, reached \"unprecedented levels of leaked.\" Yet somehow, it now is even more leaked. The latest leakage comes by way of PEGI , the Pan European Game Information agency, which has helpfully provided an 18 rating for something called Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced. There's little more to be gleaned from the rating at this point, except that the game has violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. (Image credit: PEGI) I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment, because as far as I know it has continued to steadfastly refuse that any of this is happening. And while I typically cast such requests into the ether with no real hope that my existence will even be acknowledged, much less responded to, in this case I feel like maybe Ubisoft is ready to throw up its hands and finally cop to the whole thing.

This fascinating action roguelike feels like a modern spin-off of 2008 god game Spore. Starting as a cute little blob creature, your goal is to survive in an increasingly dangerous ecosystem. Initially you're easy prey, but as you eat food you level up, gaining new genetic traits and (hopefully) rising to the top of the food chain. (Image credit: Odd Dreams Digital) As I set out on my first few runs, what immediately impresses me is the sheer variety of different traits, particularly because a really large selection of them are reflected visually on my creature. I can cover them in scales, fur, or an exoskeleton; give them claws, poison spit, bull horns, or spines; make them huge and lumbering or quick and tiny; and much, much more. It all combines seamlessly, both visually and mechanically—whether I've built the ultimate predator, or (more often) one of God's mistake…",

Industry sources claim Dell may raise its prices as soon as mid-December, and by as much as 20%. Lenovo on the other hand has apparently told customers that all of its current quotes will expire as of January 1, 2026 (via TrendForce ). Why? You guessed it: memory shortages and surging prices , driven by the demands of big tech's AI pipedreams. HP estimates that memory accounts for around 15 to 18% of the cost of even a fairly standard PC, with CEO Enrique Lores already warning that the second half of 2026 will be a particular challenge pricewise (via Asia Business Daily ). Seeing as PC gaming is expensive as it is, knowing further price hikes are imminent is still a bitter pill to swallow. As such, some have not been shy to voice their displeasure, with Framework for one directly criticising Dell's price hikes.

In the latest case of smuggling shenanigans, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) reports that it's seized \"over $50 million in Nvidia technologies and cash\" from some who had been attempting to smuggle H100 and H200 GPUs to China, both of which were until very recently banned from being shipped to China, and the former of which still is. And I do mean very recently, because it's only earlier today that President Trump said China will be allowed to receive H200 shipments , albeit for a 25% fee (via Reuters ).

It's a proprietary rather than open standard. What really marks this drive out from, say, the even smaller microSD format is the combination of performance and full NVMe 1.4 support. The CL100 measures 15 mm by 17 mm and fits into a slide-in tray that very much resembles a phone SIM tray. A microSD card is just 11 mm by 15 mm, but doesn't offer all the features and performance of a proper NVMe SSD. The Biwin CL100 does.

Its newer IPs haven't done great, either. Remember Babylon's Fall? You'd better, 'cause it'll only exist in your memories forever . It's almost enough to make me feel sad for a large company (almost—you shouldn't do that) to see it now hit with a 100-slide presentation on its alleged mismanagement from one of its major shareholders. 3D Investment, which holds a 14.36% stake in the company, is now looking to get other shareholders onside. As shared here by Businesswire (thanks, Automaton ), 3D Investment states that Square Enix has, in the three years since replacing its president , been \"facing the following management issues: (i) a sluggish revenue growth rate and (ii) sluggish profit margins … More recently, SQEX HD recorded massive impairment losses on game development assets, which lack earning power, so SQEX HD is in a very serious situation.\" This is exasperated by the fact, the shareholder argues that Square's \"medium-te…",

Getting into a shoot-out if you're in squads isn't necessarily a death sentence, especially if you have some seasoned raiders on your side, but it can usually get pretty messy if you're in solos.

The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix. So, in terms of HDR support, these are entry-level panels and won't have local dimming. It's also worth noting that t…",

But, much like a lot of Minecraft's underwater mobs, they can be quite challenging to track down, let alone tame. With how much of a Minecraft world is covered in ocean, tracking a Nautilus can seem quite intimidating. However, there's actually a pretty solid method you can follow if you're stuck on where to start looking. Here's what you need to do if you want to get an underwater mount for yourself, and how you can tame it once and for all. Where to find Nautilus in Minecraft Nautilus spawn in all ocean biomes in Minecraft, including frozen and warm, which makes the job of hunting one down a little easier. With that said, they don't appear at the surface, and you'll have to delve beyond level 38 to find one . Fortunately, they tend to spawn in groups of two or three, so if you find one, the chances you'll encounter a few extra to tame are high too.

I've been deep in the mines spelunking for rare minerals, and have plenty of tips for where to start your search. Where to find Stone in The Forge You'll find Stone by mining Pebbles in The Cave. It also drops from bigger rock nodes deeper in the mines, but I found it easier to go for the smaller targets up front, away from the dangerous enemies lurking further in. Here's the step-by-step on what that process looks like: In Stonewake's Cross (the first area), head southeast and enter The Cave Equip your Pickaxe and look for Pebbles in the entrance area (near Umut) Hold left click to chip away at Pebbles, keep at it until you find Stone Image 1 of 2 It's a tiny notification, but you can see what mineral you've mined at the bottom of the screen.

The \"work in progress\" video purports to be a recording of a display screen, rather than a direct capture, so the quality isn't great and, more importantly, it's trickier to suss out whether it's AI generated. But it has long-suffering Shenmue fans hopeful: It's been six years since Shenmue 3 dropped (which happened a full 18 years after Shenmue 2), and while Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has previously expressed a desire to make a new game in the series , there's been no movement toward that actually happening. It sure sounds like that remains the case. \"Ys Net Inc has confirmed that a video has been posted on social media which uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that it is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us,\" the studio wrote on X. \"This video has absolu…",

Developer Vedinad withdrew the game from contention in the Best Debut Indie Game category in November, revealing that it wasn't really a debut game at all: Vedinad has previously released games under other studio names. But two weeks later, it elbowed its way back— so back —in the Players' Voice category, which unlike every other TGA category is chosen entirely by fans. Well, the fans have chosen not to have Megabonk in the running for the Players' Voice category. This year's final nominees are: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Dispatch Genshin Impact Hollow Knight: Sliksong Wuthering Waves Clair Obscur might seem like the obvious favorite here, because it's the obvious favorite everywhere , but the fact that the Players' Voice category comes down to a public vote—that is, whichever community can most effectively rally its troops to the cause—really opens things up.

Path of Exile 2, however, could be the game at the end of Rogers' \"quest to make the perfect ARPG,\" he told PC Gamer in a recent interview. Despite its differences to PoE 1, some of which have gone away over the last year in early access, \"it was never really about making it feel distinct,\" he says. In the last year, Grinding Gear Games has been navigating the treacherous waters of making a sequel that veers pretty far away from the vibe of the first game. If PoE 1 is a rampage through thousands of monsters, PoE 2 is a dance with far fewer, but more threatening monsters—a fundamental shift in the feel of the game. And not everyone has been a fan of the pivot, especially when any class that feels remotely like PoE 1 inevitably gets gutted in a patch. PoE 1 veterans want to feel like gods and go fast in the new game; Rogers wants combat to feel methodical. …",

It was immediately clear that Wiebe loves Portal. He worked on the first iteration of Battlefield 6's level editing/publishing platform during Battlefield 2042 development, back when the toolset was, in his words, \"more like a Battlefield builder than anything.\" In that game, Portal was squarely focused on mashing up different eras of Battlefield. You could pit futuristic jets versus WW2 planes, summon bots, and tweak rules to your heart's content, but without complex scripting or the ability to place new geometry, its creative ceiling was low. \"The people were phenomenal at stretching what we had built to do some amazing things, but they had to really work hard,\" Wiebe told PC Gamer.

Oh yeah, there's also the three other games the company has in development: horror title OD, espionage game PhysInt, and an untitled collaboration with Niantic (of Pokemon GO fame). Kojima's been doing a round of interviews to see out the year, and the latest with the Japanese outlet Ananweb sees him reflecting on all of these game projects. As ever, Kojima says he doesn't think of Death Stranding 2 as \"finished\" because \"I actually wanted to continue until around September.\" Kojima says that the studio's games \"have to be unique and sell to a certain extent. This is difficult. Our previous game, Death Stranding, was too unique, so we had to carefully adjust the balance to broaden the audience for this one.\" The example he gives is a snowy mountain that's twice as high as anything in the previous game: \"When we gathered monitors and played it for the first time, everyone…",

It's an implement that grants a different relationship with our earthly geometry. Skating is an almost occultic discipline, its practitioners defying worldly convention to dabble in transcendent matters of slope, rotation, and bodily contortion. Skate Story takes that to an extreme. If Dante Alighieri had known that skateboarding could be a weapon of metaphysical rebellion against hell and reality itself, his Inferno would also have followed a \"demon made of glass and pain\" who's entered into a contract with the Devil to eat the moon in exchange for their soul.

In a sense, you trade all of this for the things you lose, such as blueprints, quest progress, and workbench upgrades.

Allegedly stated in two internal memos seen by Business Insider, Meta is reportedly pushing back the glasses to \"get the details right\". These memos are said to state that Meta needs \"breathing room\" in order to put out a \"fully polished\" device. It was originally suggested to launch in the latter half of 2026. Reports suggest Meta's MR glasses are a bit closer to goggles and even come with a power puck, like the Apple Vision Pro. If true, this would tether the device somewhat but could also allow for a more lightweight feel in the headset itself.

The UOP will \"download and install updates based on user activity and system state\". Though rather than Windows Update, which provides patches for the OS and some applications and services, or Microsoft Store, UOP allows apps to stick to their own backend updating service. So, think of it like the OS helping apps to download updates when the system isn't in use. Apps need to be registered to the UOP via an API, but once done, they can stay up-to-date without monitoring. In a Microsoft blog back in May this year, product manager Angie Chen said UOP is a \"Unified future for app updates\", as it will work with both Windows and non-Windows apps. Windows will then provide a unified app update history for all updates on the system, so all in one place.

So in an attempt to remedy this, Beyer has introduced a lighter, closed back headphone with an easily detachable cable that can work both 3.5mm and USB-C. The new, smaller, Beyerdynamic DT 270 Pro can't beat my beloved DT 900 Pro X in sheer performance and comfort but it can certainly pack down into my backpack a helluva lot easier while still giving me that sweet, sweet Beyerdynamic sound. The design language is pure Beyerdynamic minimalism. Matte black cups, spring-steel headband, understated padding—no RGB strips, no gamer logos, nothing you'd be embarrassed to wear out and about.

But did you know exactly how much spoken dialogue, down to the very second? Well, one fan, who seems to've done the legwork, is able to answer that question: 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds. User Everwhite-moonlight on the Baldur's Gate 3 subreddit has compiled a spreadsheet that tallies not only the hours spoken by each character (and their respective voice actor), but also the amount of files they speak in. For example, Amelia Tyler, who voices the game's silk-toned narrator, is understandable top billing at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds of chatting—over a brain-boggling 7,629 files. Hilariously, Astarion takes the prize for biggest yapper in all of Baldur's Gate, just one hour shy of beating out the main character's literal inner monologue: 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. Larian's work is even more impressive when Everwhite-moonlight tallies it up, though: \"There are about 173,642 voice files in the game with the combine…",

So after months of living exclusively out of my Liked Songs folder and Spotify Radio, I finally went ahead and made a brand-new playlist a few weeks ago. One that could serve as the perfect ambience for my day-to-day life: working, cooking, cleaning, and unwinding with a glass of wine and my Steam Deck. And what better fodder for my super chill, super relaxing playlist than videogame music? After all, its entire purpose is to create ambience. It's vibes personified. Instead of telling you how it's feeling, it's trying to tell you how you should feel. Ooh, don't you feel so fuzzy and nostalgic as I play the flute in this quaint woodland village? Isn't the sul ponticello on this violin making you scared? You get my point. I have long championed soft piano pieces from JRPGs as the ultimate relaxation music, but I've found myself branching out to some less likely candidates as of late. The Minecraft soundtrack has been absolutely rinsed in my house…",

Fewer than 10 pieces are currently listed on the website, and an even smaller number of each size, if any at all. So while I wait for my precious Axolotl Ushanka to come back in stock, I spoke to Scott Guthrie, the founder and creative director of Cool Shirtz, to learn about how the collection actually came to life. More specifically, the creative choices behind pursuing a Minecraft collaboration. When I asked why Cool Shirtz wanted to go ahead with a Minecraft collection, Guthrie said: \"I have such an incredibly deep appreciation for this game, so it felt very natural! It was exciting to put my knowledge to use in building something of a love letter to a property that has brought me a lot of joy over the years.

Previously Studio Director of Criterion Games, Sperry was at the studio throughout its golden era.
