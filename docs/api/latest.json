In a video published earlier today , Capcom outlined the additions coming in the final major Wilds update, including the returning elder dragon Gogmazios, new weapon and armor upgrade systems, and—crucially—improvements for the performance issues that have tarnished the game's reputation so badly that Capcom's own investors are using Wilds as shorthand for performance concerns. Unfortunately, PC hunters will once again have to wait to see the full extent of the performance fixes Capcom has been promising since July . While Capcom says the Title Update 4 launch will implement multi-platform optimization improvements, additional performance fixes specific to the PC version won't arrive until January in a follow-up patch. (Image credit: Capcom) Capcom's TU4 showcase included a more detailed schedule of its planned performance and stability improvements.

Well, Nick Valentine's my favourite anyway. PCG's Ted Litchfield interviewed Bethesda's design director Emil Pagliarulo who, with Thief's Garrett as the launching point, went into detail on the early stages of Fallout 4, when the game was set in New York (it would end up being set in Boston). \"Stephen Russell was the first actor I ever wrote dialog for back in Thief,\" says Pagliarulo, referencing synth gumshoe Nick Valentine's voice actor. \"He was a character that I created. He was in the very first design document that I ever wrote for Fallout 4, when it was set in New York.

But the decisions the company makes about the mode, including the most recent update, are often not in support of that goal. Players level up their strength so fast and so far in Remix that they're ridiculously overpowered, tackling even the toughest group content in the game solo, romping through old dungeons and raids as if they were new-player zones.

Case in point, the Zotac Magnus EN mini workstation with RTX 5060 Ti, which seems to power that GPU via the PCIe connector, and not in the same way as Asus BTF cards and motherboards. The mini PC was disassembled and inspected by HKEPC , then brought to my attention by Unikoshardware and Wccftech . Apart from how impressive it is to be able to fit a discrete desktop RTX 5060 Ti into such a small chassis at all, one thing that sticks out is the complete lack of a power cable for the GPU. Looking at GPU-Z shows something interesting: \"Bus interface: PCIe x8 5.0 @ x8 5.0.\" Normally, for an RTX 5060 Ti, it would just show x 5.0. While I'm not sure what the \"@\" is all about, that's basically hinting that the x16 PCIe fingers are split into two batches of x8. And upon closer inspection of the graphics card, it is in fact split in two. As Uniko and Wccf point out, the split-off part gets fed a 19 V input, as they're not being used for…",

The Ayaneo Pocket Play is a smartphone with a sliding display that can be pushed up to reveal a d-pad, AXBY face buttons, and two virtual joystick touchpads. Ayaneo had previously teased this gaming-geared phone early last month . Now, there's a fresh blog post in Ayaneo's typically effusive style about the Pocket Play, plus a Kickstarter page . However, tech specs remain thin on the ground. We don't yet know what processor this bad boy will end up boasting, or even the device's display dimensions. However, given that Ayaneo is known for Android-based gaming handhelds such as the Snapdragon-based Ayaneo Pocket S , perhaps I won't need all three guesses to figure out this phone's headlining hardware specs. So, like most of its ilk, it will likely be an Android device. That means we won't be able to play our precious PC games on it without an emulator, such as Winlator, which is a bit of a job to set up. At least other forms of Android emulation are generally excellent these days. Though there's no gesture at a release window beyond the words 'coming soon,' I'm already intrigued.

Patch 1.6.0 targets four specific issues: Removing the zipline on Stella Montis that lets players go out of bounds. Fixing a collision that let players get through a wall in Blue Gate. Fixing material issues, which meant bullets or arcs' vision weren't blocked by some objects. Patching a gap at the Spaceport Launch Tower, which allowed players to get shot through a wall.

Emphasis on the early phrasing there. Intrepid's Steam description (and official site) reiterates in quite a few places you're getting an unfinished build of adventures in Verra, but the whole early access thing should make that clear enough. Perhaps it's just hammering home Ashes of Creation is still in its second alpha build and has two beta periods planned before 1.0, whenever that is. You've got less than 24 hours left until Ashes of Creation throws the gates wide open for its early access launch. That's probably not too bad a wait if you're the type with enough patience to play various iterations of an old-school PvX MMORPG where your progression may be wiped. Ashes of Creation release time and date on Steam early access Ashes of Creation launches in early access at 10 am PST on Thursday, December 11.

The yearly Call of Duty game is such a calcified constant of our hobby that, at some point, the people who used to say \"they should stop making CoD every single year\" just sorta gave up and accepted that series is as inevitable as back pain. We pleaded to Activision to take a break, made our case that the 12-month cycle was unsustainable and diminishing, and Activision responded by doing the exact opposite for going on 20 years. With the sort of \"milk it dry\" hubris that defined the Bobby Kotick era of Activision, the megapublisher decided it could outpace CoD burnout— outrun diminishing returns—by tripling down. More studios, more bodies, more CoD. CoD but battle royale. CoD zombies. CoD extraction. CoD on your phone. CoD but battle royale, but on your phone.

      "body": "The US edition of PC Gamer magazine liked The Temple of Elemental Evil enough to award it a respectable 79% in 2003 , but we still had more than a few monster-sized bones to pick with Troika's D&D RPG: NPC companions silently loading themselves up with so much worthless loot they become encumbered by it; atrocious pathfinding; and numerous other obvious bugs and avoidable snags bringing down an otherwise promising adventure. This matched my own experience with the game back then. The enticing promise of a full and faithful digital recreation of D&D's 3.5 ruleset—and a chance to throw magic missiles somewhere other than the Sword Coast thanks to the game's use of the Greyhawk setting—was brought down by frustrating technical issues and odd design choices. I was never quite sure if I was doing something wrong or because the game had got its d20s in a twist again, so I quickly decided to stop playing rather than spend hours scouring forums in the hope of finding the right workaround. Which is why SNEG's re-release of this famously temperamental game, out now on Steam , is so interesting. The 1000+ community-created tweaks, fixes, additions, and restorations within have been floating …",

You can watch Romero discussing the status of his studio in the video embedded below. \"We survived the cancellation of our huge game,\" Romero said, earning applause from the audience.

So, if you're not super familiar with the world of Moomins you might feel a little bit out of your depth, as you're immediately introduced to Moomintroll and the gaggle of Fillyjonks' children. However, you don't really need to know the ins and outs of each character, which is one of the reasons these games are so enjoyable. You also get a feel of the characters through the dialogue alone. As Moomintroll is approached by Fillyjonks' children in the snow, they seem incredibly panicked and are quick to ask for your help.

Word of the layoffs, confirmed by multiple Glowmade employees on LinkedIn , comes just a couple months after the release of King of Meat, a \"co-op party platformer\" for up to four players. It's yet another ugly outcome for a game studio, but what makes this case particularly interesting is that the report claims \"leadership\"—whether that's at Glowmade or Amazon isn't specified—was expecting a concurrent player count for King of Meat of at least 100,000. The actual number? On Steam, it peaked at just 320, according to SteamDB, a number it only managed to achieve thanks to a free weekend.

The display in question is the snappily-titled ROG Strix 5K XG27JCG , and as the name suggests, its key feature is the 5120 x 2880 IPS panel. Coming in at 27 inches in size, though, that's a lot of pixels being packed in there. Specifically, it's 218 pixels per inch, which is an absurdly high density. Pro creators never really care that much about having a display with high refresh rates, but gamers do. Fortunately, despite its immense pixel density, the ROG Strix 5K still manages to top out at 180 Hz, with FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatible VRR support, all with a grey-to-grey response time of 0.3 milliseconds. Sounds fab, right? Well, a resolution of 5120 x 2880 is 77% more pixels than 4K, so you can well imagine how hard it would be for any GPU to run a game at this level.

Speaking of offerings, Razer is only offering 1,337—uh, huh—units of the Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition. So, if you want one, well, you know what to do. Putting the FOMO aside for a moment, the original Boomslang offered 2,000 DPI mechanical ball tracking (actually, the original-original Boomslang was 1,000 DPI and predates 2005, more on which in a moment) that was ground-breaking at the time. The new model ups that to fully 45,000 DPI, then throws in 8,000 Hz polling and optical switches with claimed 100 million click lifespan for good measure. Oh, and where the OG Boomslang was wired, this reboot is inevitably wireless and comes with what Razer describes as a dock with \"next-gen\" charging.

(Sorry, Demon's Crest guy. You'll have your day.) Much of the report is spent on financial talk: Capcom boasts it's \"achieved 12 consecutive years of increased operating profit\" and \"four decades of steady growth toward our goal of making the most entertaining games in the world.\" Still, it's determined a \"need\" to broaden its output, and has identified the three series I mentioned as high value and worth leveraging with new titles. Specifically, the report includes a statement from Capcom COO Haruhiro Tsujimoto, as spotted by Mega Man news site Rockman Corner : \"Capcom owns a wealth of globally popular brands, such as Mega Man, Devil May Cry, and Ace Attorney.

With Asetek's 20-year patent on AIO coolers expiring earlier this year, the market has seen a flood of new models, all at vastly reduced prices. That's been good for us PC builders. However, for cooling companies, it's become increasingly harder to make something that stands out from the crowd. Enter stage left, the Jonsbo TF3-360SCB , which (to quote the great Marge Simpson) I think is just neat.

Better known as FSR 'Redstone', the work done here essentially brings AMD on par with Nvidia and Intel, in terms of applying AI to upscaling, frame generation, and other rendering technologies. However, it's worth pointing out now that AMD still doesn't have multi-frame generation, so it's not quite at the same level.

I mean, I thought that the Maximus character is a fascinating creation, a fascinating slant to take you into the Brotherhood of Steel.

According to Embark's official Arc Raiders roadmap , the Cold Snap update brings a new map condition called snowfall, the \"Flickering Flames\" event, a new raider deck (basically a battle pass), and new quests. Players have speculated about what exactly the snowfall map condition will entail (is it just the same maps but with snow?), but a teaser image shared by Embark today of a collapsed raider in the snow suggests the extreme temperatures will carry consequences. It looks like players might have to limit their exposure to the elements to avoid freezing to death, or perhaps toss an incendiary grenade to warm up. That's the most obvious way to make heat a factor of survival, but I wonder if Embark would go even further—what if wearing warmer clothes, like a fur jacket, increased your heat resistance?
