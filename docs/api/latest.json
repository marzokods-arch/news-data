Either way, I'm here to blow away your dreams with a V.A.T.S.-aimed guaranteed crit: Purnell confirmed in an interview with Geek Culture that \"Ghoulcy\" is not happening. To be more accurate, her exact words were \"Here's what I would say: you guys need therapy. You can't fix him. You can't save him. Let it go. Let it go, hon.\" She added later in the interview that what Lucy and the Ghoul have is a \"really beautiful thing\" and said \"they're both looking for the people that they love; let's leave it at that.\" Much like Walton Goggins in that clip, who remarked he had never heard of this pairing with a beaming smile, Ghoulcy was not on my radar. However, there is a small but fanatical subreddit dedicated to the theoretical ship. It doesn't seem like they're taking the news well; one comment from user Funishin replied to a thread about the interview saying, \"Writers are too cowardly to make Ghoulcy actually happen.\" I shouldn't be surprised; the internet is …",

While the acquisition did bear fruit—an upcoming mobile co-op life sim called Spirit Crossing —Spry Fox is parting ways with its owner after just three years, as reported by Game File . Netflix is still on publishing duties for Spirit Crossing's mobile release, but it sounds like the now independent Spry Fox is keen to put the game on other platforms too. The Game File article shares a statement from studio co-founder David Edery: \"Spirit Crossing was built to connect the world, bring people together and inspire kindness, so being able to bring the game to as many players, across different platforms, is truly the best thing for the game.\" It seems to be a more peaceable transition than Netflix's sudden closure of Team Blue , which happened before the developer ever released a game.

Alas, no, as it turns out that a very popular web app framework, used heavily in servers around the world, has been discovered to have a maximum severity security bug. The software packages in question are React Server Components, and the developers issued a rather alarming statement about a critical security vulnerability earlier this week (via The Register and Wiz ). Specifically, the vulnerability \"allows unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting a flaw in how React decodes payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints.\" Translating this to something more understandable, it basically means somebody can use a remote web request of a server running React JavaScript or a React-based application framework, and ultimately run dodgy code to extract data, override systems, or what have you.

I guess that's technically in Limveld, even though it's an entirely different map. As you'll quickly discern from the Remembrance entries, the Undertaker is a nun who started consuming the night corruption, hence the rather questionable screenshots circulating of her licking night juice off the wall while the Scholar watches her. Hey, who am I to kink shame? After you reach Chapter 6, you apparently have to defeat Heolstor in order to get the Dismembered Finger item, and then drop it next to the body during the ending. This should get you her Remembrance skin. I haven't done that bit myself yet, but I'll add details when I do. Otherwise, here's how to complete everything up to that point.

Now illuminated having watched Jinko's latest Arc Raiders mythbusting video, I've learned that these players stuck in place are the result of forcing the game closed, such as the ol' ALT+F4 or disconnecting—not from being killed or even surrendering to return to the main menu. Because you've been forced out of the match, you're able to rejoin and pick right up where you left off if you haven't been killed in your absence. As you'll see in the timestamped video above, this peculiarity can lead to some very amusing events.

Well, not any more, as Nvidia has had a change of heart and it's back again in the latest driver set. However, it is worth noting that the new Game Ready Driver 591.44 drivers won't suddenly run every 32-bit CUDA program, as Nvidia has only added support for certain games. Fortunately, it seems to be all the popular ones that were badly affected by the CUDA change, as detailed in the relevant driver blog .

AMD's Lisa Su has weighed in on the debate. Recently, in an interview with Wired , the AMD chief was asked if she thought AI was a bubble. Her response: “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” Su claims that fears around a potential bubble are \"somewhat overstated\". Unfortunately, as this is part of the Wired Big Interview series, and the larger interview hasn't been published yet, it's hard to fully surmise where Su's stance lies outside of this answer. In its barest form, a bubble is where the asset price in some industry far exceeds actual value, due in part to speculation. The 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble popping didn't mean people wouldn't buy houses or use the internet, but that the value tied up in it exceeded what it was worth, and those betting billions on it could no longer see a return on investment.

      "body": "If you've got good taste (read: the exact same taste as me), Tim Cain bears a lot of responsibility for some of your favourite games ever. His name is on the original Fallouts, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, and plenty else besides. Alas, he's been in a state of kind-of-retirement in recent years, doing bits and pieces of contract work for Obsidian, his former employer, and others, but generally contenting himself with his YouTube channel, where he chats about game design, career anecdotes, and how he's in \" semi-retirement \" now. Well, no longer. In his most recent video, Cain announced that he's moved back to California, gone back to full-time work at Obsidian (as an in-office, not remote, worker), gained several new t-shirts and a Moon Man tattoo, and befriended a squirrel in the time since he last updated us on his job situation. Which is quite a lot. I get tired if I have to go to the post office and go to work on the same day. \"I'm back at Obsidian,\" an energetic Cain told viewers. \"I'm their full-time employee, and in-person, not remote. So I'm not a contractor anymore.\" What's he working on? Well, wouldn't you like to know?…",

The method I used was similar to the one YouTuber ManyATrueNerd used to work out what level Lucy got to by the end of the first season, with a couple of tweaks. First off, as Lucy is the main character, most of the groundwork is based on her.

From a newer, refined controller to far more advanced (though still QLC) NAND flash package with higher densities and better all-around performance, it makes a damn good argument for being one of the best SSD s money can buy, at least if the price is right.

But with the new Dream Team feature coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley as part of the Winter Ball update on Wednesday, December 10, this problem might be removed entirely. In a reel posted to the Disney Dreamlight Valley YouTube channel , more details have been shown about what exactly this feature does. With this addition, you'll be able to join forces with a group of seven friends, give yourself a name, motto, and a logo, and then start requesting materials. This can be anything from crafting materials like clay and iron, to quest items like fish, flowers, and crops. If you'd rather fulfil a request from your friend instead, it's just as easy as placing one. When you're in the Dream Teams menu, you'll see every item that each of your friends has asked for. Click on the one you have, and you'll be asked if you want to trade. By agreeing, your items will immediately be shipped off to your p…",

However, the new update coming on Tuesday, December 9, not only adds a haunting new enemy, but an entirely new setting which already gives me the heebie-jeebies. In a trailer uploaded to the Red Barrels YouTube channel , Project Messiah has been revealed. This update plans to take us away from the sterile halls of the Murkoff facility and into what looks like a desolate lodge.

That level of fortune gives one plenty of opportunities to spend hours reminiscing about the past, present, and future, which is precisely what Jensen Huang and Joe Rogan recently did. Specifically, for almost two and a half hours, Huang chatted on the Joe Rogan Experience about all things AI, GPU, CUDA, consciousness, and what have you. There's an awful lot to delve into, but I was particularly drawn to the section where Rogan remarks on Nvidia's massive AI growth and capabilities: \"How funny would it be that it [AI] is birthed out of the desire for computer graphics for video games? It's kind of crazy when you think about it that way.\" This prompted Jensen to start going over Nvidia's beginning, when it was a tiny group of engineers in 1993: \"We were trying to create this new computing approach.

The absence isn't a Steam decision, though: Developer Hypixel Studios says it just doesn't want to be there at this early stage of the game. That's very counter-intuitive: Steam is far and away the dominant PC storefront, and conventional wisdom states that if you're not there, you're missing out on a major chunk of potential revenue. Witness, for instance, the reaction to the recent ban of Horses on Steam : Yeah, it was also dropped by the Epic Games Store and, for a day, Humble, but Steam is the one that really hurt, and developer Santa Ragione said losing it might force the studio to close. But Hypixel Studios has a very good reason for taking a pass on it: Steam user reviews. \"We want to spend our time in Early Access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing,\" Hytale executive director Patrick \"Lyall\" Derbic wrote in a new FAQ . \"Steam is a great marketing tool but one that we might never need.

Neither Eidos nor parent company Embracer Group (yes, it's an Embracer studio) have confirmed the layoffs or responded to requests for comment. This would be the second round of layoffs at Eidos Montreal in 2025, following a cut of roughly 75 employees in March .

The House of Hikmah doesn't have a solid release date as of yet, but we're expecting…",

Not that we didn't expect as much from PC Gamer's 95th entry in our 2025 Top 100 list , in which our Ted Litchfield described the original game as the \"trailblazer of indie boomer shooters\". The trailer for the upcoming spin-off (sidequel?) is minute and a half of gameplay footage that captures the ravenous tone in a mashup of wild carnage, with the player tearing into everything from giant rats to elite mages, and even some skeletal goat boy called \"Black Phillip\" (do we have any The VVitch fans in the house?). Taking center stage in your loadout, we've got sawn-offs, fire axes, pistols, molotovs, dual-wielded sickles, and uh, some kinda wishing well with green crap oozing out of it.

You can construct your own greenhouses, tailoring their shape and size to your wishes, and build your dream home. It's the complete package for those of you that dream of starting a new life in a quaint little town. You can also get stuck into the farming, though.

This is a game not only about smacking goblins around with firebolts, but also rebuilding a home for your people and keeping it safe.

The sequel looks like a real improvement—even if the idea of trading babies makes me a tad uneasy. But hey, who am I to question intergalactic culture? The main gameplay loop revolves around the trading day. Pick a baby, find a shadowy broker who can give you more information about what the market will do, and then buy and sell shares as its value shoots wildly up and down.
