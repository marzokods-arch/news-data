Her debut radio single “Desperate” spent seven weeks atop Billboard’s Christian AC Airplay chart. Her follow up song, “Left It in the River,” is in its eighth non-consecutive week at the pinnacle of that same chart. MacDonald’s soulful voice and unfiltered style of songwriting have led to a whirlwind of touring, awards nominations and radio hits since she signed her label deal with Capitol CMG in 2024. &#8220;Even up until now — I mean, signing a record deal at 40, if I was waiting till I felt ready for all this, it may have been never,&#8221; MacDonald says.

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud. Stephen found that focus particularly useful for building his confidence to practice in the real world.",

An overview video published by Nintendo today explains what the Talking Flower can do. The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button. It seems, well, annoying — and if you’ve played Wonder, you’ll know that’s a faithful adaptation of the character.",

AI Mode in Search now blends public web results with your private context from Gmail and Photos to deliver answers tailored to you. Personal Intelligence is fully opt-in, with clear controls to connect or disconnect Gmail and Photos at any time. Last week, we saw Google finally tackle the context packing problem by bringing Personal Intelligence to the Gemini app , allowing the AI to actually remember details about your life instead of just fetching single files. Now, Google is bringing that same memory upgrade to the search bar. Starting today, Google is expanding Personal Intelligence to AI Mode in Search . Search used to focus on indexing the world’s information, but now it can understand your own information. It combines public web results with your private data to give you answers that fit you.",

You’ll see intrusion logging when setting up Device Protection, and you can opt in or skip it. Google is changing how mobile security works with the new Intrusion Detection feature , which helps you see exactly what happened if someone gains access to your device. This feature is now rolling out to some devices, months after it was first announced, and it could make a big difference for anyone concerned about compromised accounts. Intrusion logging is a new part of Android’s security tools and is now becoming available on actual devices. Earlier this month, we saw the feature in action for the first time. Now, it’s showing up on devices with Android 16, like the OnePlus Pad 3 . A Pixel user on Reddit also reported that the feature is live on their phone with Android 16 QPR2.",

The shape of the download progress ring around the app icons is changing, as is the loading icon when switching pages. This looks to be a staged rollout by Google, so you might not spot it on your device for a while. Google has spent the past year slowly threading Material 3 Expressive through Android and its first-party apps. Some of the changes are nothing short of an overhaul, whereas others are relatively minor shifts in colors or icons. The Google Play Store appears to be the latest app to get a subtle facelift, with new expressive download and loading animations now starting to show up for some users.

ExoMiner++, a recently updated open-source software package developed by NASA, uses artificial intelligence to help find new transiting exoplanets in data collected by NASA’s missions. NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI) Scientists have discovered over 6,000 planets that orbit stars other than our Sun, known as exoplanets. More than half of these planets were discovered thanks to data from NASA’s retired Kepler mission and NASA’s current TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission. However, the enormous treasure trove of data from these missions still contains many yet-to-be-discovered planets. All of the data from both missions is publicly available in NASA archives, and many teams around the world have used that data to find new planets using a number of techniques. In 2021, a team from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley created ExoMiner, a piece of open-source software that used artificial intelligence (AI) to validate 370 new exoplanets from Kepler data.

Instead of recording the caller’s message as a voicemail, it may allow them to hear you in the background. The bug appears to affect all supported Pixel phones, starting with the Pixel 4. If you have no time to go through all your voicemails, Google’s “Take a Message” feature for Pixel devices can be really useful. If you miss or decline a call, Take a Message can automatically spin into action, informing the caller that you’re unavailable and asking them to record a message. While it sounds like voicemail, the feature uses AI to transcribe the message and automatically store it in your Pixel’s call history, where you can revisit it later. While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well. While very useful in theory, it has reportedly been malfunctioning, letting callers hear you instead of recording their message. Several users have highlighted this issue with Take a Message on their Pixel phones over the last few months. These reports, spotted by 9to5Google , are not limited…",

      "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code for a new feature that will let users delete all their contributed incident reports. The option will likely be under Settings &gt; Location &amp; Privacy, and accessing it will remove the association between your submitted reports and your account. Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports. That could soon change, as Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code suggesting Google could soon let users delete all their contributed reports across incidents, road conditions, transit, and trip issues.

The company has reportedly agreed to cover the cost of the phone, medical bills, and cleanup, and has offered $500 per person for pain and suffering. We’ve verified the user’s claims, including the report from the local fire department and Samsung’s offer. Update: January 22, 2026 (3:08 AM ET): Android Authority has since been in direct contact with the affected user, who has shared documentation with us. We’ve reviewed the local fire department report, which confirms a thermal runaway event, as well as written communication showing Samsung has offered compensation covering the phone, medical expenses, cleanup costs, and a separate pain-and-suffering amount. This confirms that the incident did occur as described and that Samsung has made the compensation offer described in the original Reddit post. We’ve also reached out to Samsung US for a comment on the matter.",

This is the second hike of $0.50 since last year, but you’ll be spared if your monthly plan already includes federal taxes and telco fees. If you’re a T-Mobile customer in the US , your bill just went up overnight. That’s because the carrier is adding an auxiliary charge, separate from your monthly payment plan. As of Wednesday, January 21, T-Mobile is increasing its “Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee” to $4.99 per voice line and $2.10 per mobile data line. That’s a $0.50 increase compared to before this date, when the fee per voice line was $3.99. If you have multiple lines in your plan, the total should reflect on your bill starting this month.

Like Hydra, the platform appears to regenerate as quickly as one of it’s somains is cut back. Earlier this month, shadow library Anna’s Archive, infamous for scraping 300TB of Spotify’s most played songs , suddenly lost its main .org domain. At the time, the site’s operator downplayed the situation, saying that domain takedowns for sites like theirs happen often .

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

And if a review unit can genuinely make you contemplate the whole layout of your home to try and keep it in use, that’s a really good sign. If you have the room, the Aetherion is one of the most technically impressive projectors I’ve used.",

On Android, however, I struggle to find apps with uniquely designed experiences. As long as the app technically does what it’s intended to do, it gets a passing grade for most people. I’ve long wanted to see that change, and I think the only way that happens is if Google leads from the top. Material 3 Expressive shows Google is recognizing design’s importance more than ever before — I prefer it to Apple’s Liquid Glass — but it only matters if the design system is applied to the apps we use every day.

To get the ball rolling, our own Hadlee Simons gave his breakdown when we ran the poll, ranking major Android brands from worst to best based on how their 2025 played out. He obviously considered the hardware side, but also things like software support, strategy, and whether the brand actually seemed to be moving in the right direction. He ultimately concluded that no OEM deserved the top spot, but second and third positions went to Samsung and OnePlus, respectively.

If the tool determines that you’re under the age of 18, extra protections will be placed on your account to reduce exposure to inappropriate content. Anyone who is incorrectly placed in the under-18 category will have to verify their age with a selfie. Since last year, YouTube has been cracking down on non-age-verified accounts. Although the goal is to protect the platform’s youngest viewers, the age-prediction system YouTube deployed has wrongly ensnared countless accounts owned by adults. If you’re tagged by the system, you can restore full access to your account, but only if you provide proof of your age first. Now OpenAI is following YouTube’s lead and rolling its own age-prediction system for ChatGPT accounts. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Today, another leak corroborates part of that story while contradicting another. Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels.

      "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR The Google Phone app now supports landscape UI, meaning it will rotate if your system-wide auto-rotate is on. However, this feature apparently keeps getting added and removed between stable updates. Google also added a portrait lock toggle in beta releases, but the setting hasn’t made its way to the stable release yet, causing further confusion. Until Google makes up its mind, users can stop the unintentional rotation by disabling system-wide auto-rotate. Back in September 2025, users began getting annoyed when their phone calls switched to landscape orientation while using the Google Phone app. As it turns out, the Google Phone app had just started supporting landscape UI for calls , and users with auto-rotate enabled on their phones were seeing the intended behavior but mistakenly thought it was a bug. Users are complaining once again that the Phone app is turning to landscape, and, as before, it might still be intended behavior. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Customers may be flagged internally, prompting reps to offer the card proactively via SMS during a visit. You’re still under no obligation to apply, but don’t be surprised if the card comes up quickly and unprompted. If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

Its full-color, 60Hz screen paired with Android 14 offer more flexibility than many e-readers. The tablet is available now in Europe for around €369, with no US release confirmed. Most Android tablets focus on brighter screens and higher specs. The HANNspree Lumo takes a different approach, using a reflective LCD display designed to mimic the look of paper while still running full Android. It lands somewhere between a tablet and an e-reader, offering users a more comfortable everyday tablet experience. Instead of a traditional LCD or OLED panel, the Lumo features a 7.8-inch reflective LCD display that relies primarily on ambient light. The result is a matte, low-glare screen that’s easier on the eyes, especially compared to the backlit panels most tablets feature. HANNspree describes the Lumo as a “Dynamic Paper Tablet,” positioning it as a middle ground between traditional tablets and dedicated e-readers. Physically, the tablet is slim and lightweight, measuring about 6.6mm thick and weighing roughly 250g.",

However, scammers are also allegedly exploiting the situation by sending phishing messages pretending to offer these credits. Authorities advise using the official Verizon app or website directly rather than clicking links in emails or texts. Verizon’s outage last week left many subscribers unable to connect to the network for many hours. This not only impacted personal communication, but also left people like gig workers high and dry. Verizon announced that users would receive $20 in credits per account, and while some people have had success requesting higher amounts , scammers are now cashing in on the opportunity by baiting users with promises of credit.

      "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR OpenAI is planning to unveil its first device in 2026. The company hasn’t revealed specifics about the design or its utility, but commented on the likelihood of multiple devices. Besides unveiling the ChatGPT-powered device, OpenAI might also start selling it in 2026. It’s no secret that OpenAI is building an AI device that will somehow integrate ChatGPT to help you with responses in the physical world. It has been on the cards since 2024, when OpenAI joined hands with Apple’s former design lead Jony Ive , and then followed by acquiring Ive’s startup in 2025. While the exact nature of the device remains unknown, various hypotheses have emerged. For instance, a leaker last year suggested it could be an audio device shaped like a pen , while a more recent leak indicated it would be a pair of earphones with a previously unseen design . Although the details remain hazy, OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane offered some visibility on the timeline. Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum at the Axios House forum in Davos, Switzerland, Lehane said OpenAI’s device is “on track” to be unveiled in the second half …",
