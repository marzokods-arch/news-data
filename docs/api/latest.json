We've all been there. Late on Sunday, reports started emerging on Reddit and elsewhere that players were unable to login to League of Legends, with their attempts stalling out indefinitely at the game's initial loading screen. While Riot shortly said it was \"looking into the issue,\" players quickly narrowed in on the root of the problem after checking the client's error logs: Windows was rejecting its connection attempts because of an expired SSL certificate. SSL—short for \"Secure Sockets Layer\"—is a security protocol for establishing encrypted connections between a server and client. To form an SSL connection, the client and server verify each other's SSL certificates, which are issued by trusted third-party certificate authorities and must be regularly renewed. If…",

According to Cherry, the new MX 8.2 Pro TMR keyboard is \"more than magnetic\"—whatever that means. What I can tell you is that it \"delivers ultra-fast wireless performance,\" alongside lower power consumption, and the flexibility of hot swappable switches. So, if TMR isn't your thing for whatever reason, the MX 8.2 will allow you to swap between both magnetic and mechanical switches. If you stick with the Cherry MK Crystal Magnetic switches, you'll enjoy \"ultra-smooth linear input with 0.01 mm precision\" alongside an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate. The wireless, tenkeyless MX 8.2 Pro TMR keyboard will cost about $250 when it releases on January 29, though it won't be lonely in the lineup for long. The K5 Pro TMR keyboard—a follow-up to the wired Cherry Xtrfy K5V2 from 2024—will drop later in the Spring.

The two companies used to be one and the same—with Sandisk a subsidiary of WD. However, WD decided to separate from Sandisk ; WD would focus on the lucrative HDD business and Sandisk would become its own entity focused on SSDs. The split happened in February last year. It all went off without a hitch; the only problem being the branding. Sandisk, now independent from WD, had the company's name on most of its best products. Today, that all changes. Sandisk is rolling out the 'Optimus' brand, which includes three tiers: Sandisk Optimus Sandisk Optimus GX Sandisk Optimus GX Pro Yeah, heavy use of the letter X and the word 'Pro'; nothing out of the ordinary for a tech brand here.

Asus reports the glasses can cover 95% of the \"human focus area\" with its 57-degree field of view. The one spec that gives me pause here is the FHD resolution (aka 1080p). With a screen being so close to your eyes and intended to give such a huge screen digital experience, this feels very low given how large the virtual screen will be. Still, the display is impressive, with the Xreal R1 AR being the first 240 Hz gaming glasses. A Micro-OLED screen should look mighty impressive, but font fringing is a worry on OLED panels, especially at lower resolutions. These are designed as gaming glasses, so that should be less of a worry, but it's certainly something I'd consider if I wanted to use them in a productivity capacity too.

Mistakenly, I picked Ball x Pit , an indie roguelike I'd overlooked when it launched back in October 2025 despite it selling 300,000 copies in just five days .

At launch, that math held true. In three days, Monster Hunter Wilds had sold a triumphant 8 million copies—the fastest-selling launch in Capcom's history. 10 months later, the story of Monster Hunter Wilds has a very different tone. On Steam, its review rating hangs at a middling Mixed, having intermittently plunged to Mostly Negative when updates either neglect or worsen the game's profound performance issues. By July, its sales had collapsed—and after news broke that it had gone from 10 million launch sales to less than 500,000 in a quarter, Capcom's stock price plummeted alongside.

Regardless, here's one more bit of evidence for the 'Howard doesn't hate Obsidian' pile: in a chat with Game Informer (via GamesRadar ), Howard said that, when it came to a non-Bethesda studio making a Fallout game, it was Obsidian or bust. \"They were the only choice,\" said Howard. \"They had done something similar with Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well.\" In 2004, Obsidian put out Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2—a follow-up to BioWare's KOTOR 1 that more than a few people (myself included) came to regard as their favourite of the two games, and that despite the fact Obsidian had barely over a year to make the whole thing.

The DLC is split into levels in which you need to find clues and solve puzzles, but its open-world nature means you can explore at your own pace too. You're able to venture through Mirkwood forest, the Starcourt Mall, and even throw yourself into the Upside Down if you're feeling brave. It's actually scarier than the Nether, especially when you've got a pack of demogorgons on your tail. As you make your way around the world and solve the various puzzles tucked away, the world will \"evolve\" to give you new areas to explore as well. To coincide with the setting, most of Stranger Things' iconic characters are available to play as too, and each comes with unique abilities to help you make your way through Hawkins.

The game got a poor reception, including from us. Steven Messner scored the game 55% in his Anthem review and called it \"deeply flawed and frequently frustrating,\" though very pretty indeed (I am often described the same way). BioWare pledged to \"reinvent\" the game around a year after release until another year later in 2021, when EA execs said 'Actually, hold that thought', and cancelled development entirely. Despite all that, the game's servers have been up and running for all that time; the world's slim supply of Anthem-heads have been able to get their fill for years. But it's all about to come to an end. Anthem's servers are set to finally judder to a halt on January 12, 2026, putting an end to any way to play the game. That's seven days from now, if you've still not wrapped your head around what year it is. Which, hey, same. BioWare had its fair share of con…",

Beginning production in the winter of 2024, the team slow-cooked a total conversion mod in (semi) secret,\" the announcement reads. \"The community came out in force, producing an unprecedented 77 maps, pushing the limits of the Quake engine to bring the oppressive, gritty, and beautiful aesthetic of brutalism to life.\" The first and second Brutalist Jams were already impressive, but this new one is on another level. It comes bearing all sorts of new weapons, enemies, power ups, 3D art assets, which the release announcement posits is a \"a complete visual overhaul of Quake's existing roster.\" It shows off the goods in a trailer that released yesterday and it's barely recognizable …",

It includes the loss of his family, his adventures as a solo survivalist, and run-ins with various others, like a group of children that he becomes caretaker for in his old age, unwittingly laying the groundwork for a new tribal culture you meet in the present day, the Sorrows.

Well, there's good reason to think that it might just be a goer. Because this new MSI monitor rocks Samsung's very latest QD-OLED panel technology . MSI is referring to it as \"5th-Gen\" Samsung QD-OLED, which is news to me. I thought the very latest panel tech from Samsung is Gen 4. Likewise, MSI refers to not only \"5th Gen\" but \"5th Gen Tandem OLED\" when describing this panel technology, which leaves me a bit baffled. \"Tandem OLED\" has hitherto been a marketing pitch employed by LG, Samsung's main competitor in the OLED panel manufacturing industry, to describe its own latest WOLED technology. Has someone in MSI marketing department gotten a little over excited when it comes to both the 5th-Gen and the tandem thing? Very possibly.

Fortunately, Clair Obscur didn't win Game of the Year in the Steam Awards, though it did take the Best Soundtrack Award. Overall Game of the Year went to Hollow Knight: Silksong, which also won the Best Game You Suck At Award. (Games can be nominated in multiple categories now, and also you no longer need to own a game on Steam to vote for it.) Hades 2 took the Best Game on Steam Deck Award and Dispatch won the Outstanding Story-Rich Game Award. Though Larian was quite surprised to see Baldur's Gate 3 nominated for the Labor of Love Award , the 2013 CRPG won it anyway. You can see all the finalists who were robbed at Steam's official Steam Awards page , but here are the winners in each category, all of which are currently discounted as part of the Winter Sale.

The full answer is complicated, and Cain took to his YouTube channel Friday to clear the air. Granted, Cain has been prolific since the '90s. While the development studio he co-founded, Troika, stopped making games after Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines, Cain went on to work on games like now-defunct MMO Wildstar and multiple Obsidian RPGs, including The Outer Worlds which he co-directed. However, Cain said in his videos that fans are ever eager to know when he might helm a new RPG in his classic style. \"I love making games, so it really confuses people when they're like, 'Why are you not making games, new IPs?'\" he said in the video. \"Other people have made way more money off of IPs I've created than I've ever made.

Seehorn is best known for starring alongside Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul, but her work stretches back into the '90s. As it turns out, one of her earliest live action roles was in, of all things, a Magic: The Gathering game by Microprose. It is as hilarious, blurry, and gloriously low-budget as you'd hope. All the hallmarks of cheesy '90s PC game fantasy are on proud display here, with the actors superimposed over primitive CG backgrounds. The full tutorial appears to contain well over an hour of dictated instruction and probably isn't the best way to learn a notoriously complex card game (especially since this is nearly 30 years old), but it's admirably committed to the bit. Any video of the tutorial is now festooned with comments mentioning Seehorn's character in Pluribus, jokingly factoring the role into the show's canon. You might know…",

      "body": "Interactive superhero show Dispatch was a critical success, receiving a healthy 89% in PC Gamer's review , and now we've learned it was a commercial success, too, selling over 3 million copies in 2025. That figure comes from an animated infographic AdHoc Studio posted on Bluesky earlier today, which is festooned with all sorts of stats (fair warning, it spoils some choices you'll be faced with in-game). According to the studio, players answered 727 million calls, dispatched over 1 billion heroes, and watched an estimated 23 million hours of gameplay on YouTube and Twitch. 💾 Clocking out on 2025🎆 HAPPY NEW YEAR! 🎆 — @adhocstudio.com ( @adhocstudio.com.bsky.social ) 2026-01-01T19:03:22.790Z That's all well and good, but I'm here for the funny tidbits—like how only around 164,000 players got through the game without falling for anyone. Nearly 2 million players romanced Invisigal and another million romanced Blazer, so maybe Baldur's Gate had the right idea with how, erm, eager its cast was to win the player's heart over. Videogame romance remains popular as ever, regardless of what you might hear elsewhere . Funnily enough, Dispatch itself was almost even saucier than it turned ou…",

After that, it's offered up to the people, who do the diligent work of turning it into various horror games. The pool of public domain options grows with each New Year's Day, when a fresh batch of copyrights evaporates. There are some caveats, and copyright law is distinct from trademark law; you can read more about that and see a list of notable works entering the public domain this year on the Duke Law website . This year, the earliest versions of Betty Boop, Blondie, nine Mickey Mouse cartoons, and the first week of the Mickey Mouse comic strip are all entering the public domain. There's also William Faulkner's \"As I Lay Dying,\" the 1930 film \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" and numerous other works of art and pop culture. I want to find this news delightfully novel—the public domain is the reason we have the celebrated Lies of P and American McGee's Alice —but creative leaps like those feel a mite rare compar…",

Though AI is ever becoming the buzzword when it comes to major tech events like CES, that doesn't mean there won't also be some interesting hardware to grab your attention. After all, last year saw some excellent GPUs, need laptops, great handhelds, and even actual good uses of AI. Who knew? We know the likes of AMD and Nvidia both have keynote speeches during the week, alongside dozens of other companies, and we'll even have a few members of the PC Gamer team there on the ground floor to get their grubby mitts (and fingerprints) all over that lovely new tech. Before we even touch down in Las Vegas for the big event, we know quite a bit about what to expect and what technology we're expecting to see in 2026. Let's get into it then.
