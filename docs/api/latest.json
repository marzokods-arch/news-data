While chatting about the nuts and bolts of their in-development Grand Theft Auto project, modders-turned developers Cascavel and giacobbe cited Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper, Mafia, and Schedule I as sources of inspiration for their standalone game. Although details are scarce, the pair describe it as a systems-driven game with a strong narrative core—something that blends the charm and loop-based depth of life-simulators with the grit and atmosphere of crime dramas. \"We’re being tight-lipped for now,\" says giacobbe. \"We started overly ambitious—it would’ve taken us years. So we’ve refined the idea into something more realistic and achievable. Right now, we’re focused on building our MVP gameloop while balancing our modding commitments.\" The duo cite Schedule I in particular, a solo-developed breakout hit, as a major motivator. \"It wasn’t the financial success that inspired us,\" adds Cascavel, \"but the f…",

What if there was a game that turned the clock back just like, a year or two—same alien menace, some of the same innovations, but it plays a hell of a lot more like Quake. No, I'm not talking about Unreal, I'm talking about Half-Life: Element 64 , a fresh mod that released a demo today on Steam . After spending some time with that demo, I can say it's more of an asset flip into an original game with new levels and music than a mod merely tweaking Half-Life's mechanics. There's no train ride, no resonance cascade, nothing waiting for you in the test chamberrr ; it drops you into a level select hub not unlike Quake, HEV suit and all, and from there you'll be blasting away head crabs and vortigaunts in a matter of seconds. The levels, too, are remixed into more straightforward shooting galleries. Hitscanning marines and aliens lurk around every corner, so you're never waiting long between firefights (for which your guns have been provided a pleasantly centered viewmodel).

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. When I say Arc Raiders , the first things that probably pop into your mind are arcs and raiding. But a huge part of Embark's hit extraction shooter isn't as action-oriented as any of that. A big part of the experience is managing your stash and selling anything that doesn't make the cut—well, if you're good enough at extracting with all of your loot. (Image credit: Embark) But first, you need to know what to sell. Learning which items are worth the most Raider Coins will mean you can buy more parts and weapons when times get tough. And knowing which ones you'll need for crafting and quests is crucial so you don't get stuck later on (it'd be nice if the game told you this, unfortunately it doesn't). Knowing the worth of items will also help you decide what to take back to Speranza with you when you're looting Topside. So to test you on your Arc Raiders trinket knowledge, I've amassed a bunch of in-game items, and will be asking you to rank them from most to least …",

Like roughly half of the internet, I am fascinated by Kowloon Walled City . Built on the site of a military fort, the Walled City was a Chinese enclave situated within former British Hong Kong. Its existence was tolerated by Britain provided China made no effort to exercise its jurisdiction. This peculiar legal status left it largely ignored by both nations, and as such it became the site of rapid, unplanned urban development through the latter half of the 20 th Century. At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth. More than 35,000 people lived in an area of six and a half acres, giving it a density ten times that of Earth's most tightly packed cities like Giza and Manila.

And as Sektori's developer recently explained, the kaleidoscopic schmup is still a long way from making him any money. Reacting to Sektori's launch on Bluesky, former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen said reception to the twin-stick shooter had been \"awesome\" and \"much more than I expected for such a niche thing\". Lahtinen fully appreciates the highly specific appeal of Geometry Wars-style games, likely why Housemarque itself pivoted to making third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros. Now though, Lahtinen says the response to Sektori has given him hope. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. I went into this fully knowing I would never recoup. It would be my calling card, but nothing people would have ever heard of,\" he says. \"But 100+ Steam reviews, 97% positive + ~90 Metacritic is unexpected to say the least.\" Following this, …",

The fallout from its failure was even less savoury, with Build A Rocket Boy's boss Leslie Benzies reportedly blaming the game's failure on 'saboteurs', before the studio laid off more than a hundred employees.

The main appeal of Cleared Hot is how it takes the template laid down by EA and upgrades the action with modern spectacle.

Some classes start with a taming advantage (and the Beastmaster even ranks quite high in my 99 Nights in the Forest class tier list ), but the flute is available to everyone regardless of role. Every upgrade unlocks new animals to befriend too, so instead of squishy bunnies, you can roll up on the Cultist Stronghold with a Mammoth.

Introduced to Tempest Rising \"by popular demand\" , the superweapons take the form of base structures and come equipped with a powerful standard ability, plus the potential to \"unload devastating payloads\" onto your opponent. The GDF's superweapon of choice is the drone strike station, which Slipgate summarises as \"a battle-management node that syncs directly with the GDF's satellite constellations to coordinate orbital strikes\". When constructed, it establishes a \"massive vision radius\" around itself, significantly expanding the range at which the GDF can use their intel-based abilities.

There's been no better time to try it than its 15th anniversary, as the original game is going for just $1.19 on Steam . That's the lowest it's ever been, with a price of $5.99 standing as the steepest discount recorded by SteamDB in the last two years: that's a jump from 70% to 94% off. You can also get the bundle with all the games in the series that made it to Steam for a little over $13. Thematically it's somewhere between a high school drama, Saw, and an Agatha Christie novel, with a psychotic teddy bear turning an academy into a prison of murder and mischief. While it is a visual novel, it's more gamey than the genre name perhaps implies: you investigate murders as they happen and try to pin the deed on the right culprit in a stylish minigame, literally \"firing their words back at them\" with metaphorical truth bullets.

This would mark a huge comeback of the partnership between the two companies, which Apple started to move away from in 2020. Intel used to make chips for Apple, well, Apple used to use Intel CPUs, but those processors were based on x86 architecture—and, I'm sorry to say, were nowhere near as impressive as Apple's own M-series chips. Apple's move to making its own chips signified an end to its partnership with Intel, but also the beginning of a new era, one where the M-series consistently obliterates its competitors in performance-per-watt. Apple doesn't seem to be changing its mind where the M-series is concerned, though. This new partnership wouldn't involve switching back to an Intel processor, but rather it'd involve Intel manufacturing Apple M-series chips in its own foundries. Kuo revealed that Apple plans to use Intel's 18AP process node for this. (Image credit: Future) Ming-Chi Kuo teased that Apple's plan is for Intel to make its lowest-end M-series processor.

To that end, Noctua has just quietly shared some good news for those who are already on an Intel platform: its coolers will still work with Intel's upcoming LGA1954 socket. The company wrote on its FAQ page that the same coolers that have worked with the LGA1700 (Intel Alder Lake and Raptor Lake), as well as LGA1851 (Intel Arrow Lake), will remain compatible once the next gen rolls around. Noctua products aren't exactly cheap, but they're powerful, which is why we deem the Noctua NH-D15 to be the best CPU air cooler . But it's one pricey beast. It costs $180 on Amazon right now, and Black Friday PC gaming deals seem to have had no impact on its price tag.

      "body": "CD Projekt won't be bringing The Witcher 4 to The Game Awards this year, but a new trademark filing for something called Control Resonant has some gamers hoping that Remedy will fill the void with something cool of its own. Spotted by MP1st , the European trademark filing wasn't made by Remedy but by a company called Nordia Law, a law firm with offices in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, where Remedy is based. But Nordia does have a history with Remedy: It provided legal advice to the studio in its Control 2 contract negotiations with 505 Games, for instance, (a deal that has since been undone ) and also assisted in negotiating financing deals with Tencent and Annapurna . So there's some real history there. It's no secret that a Control sequel is in development: Remedy said so back in 2022. Whether Control Resonant is that sequel is an open question, however. The trademark filing covers a lot of ground, from \"computer gaming software\" to \"printed matter\" like books and magazines, television shows, movies, music, clothing, and even, for some reason, \"lanyards for holding keys.\" It's pretty broad, in other words, and the title could be a reference to something other than a new …",

Well, here's an early heads up: The RAM apocalypse/hellscape/nightmare we're living in right now isn't about to get any better, says Maingear CEO Wallace Santos (via Wccftech ). Given how expensive RAM is right now, many gamers are holding off on their upgrades in the hopes that the market will improve in the next few months. It makes sense—when you're seeing RAM kits sold for twice the price that they used to be sold for, it's hard not to want to wait it out. The Black Friday sales have only highlighted this, when we look back at the offers around Prime Day in July—just over four months ago, remember—we've seen prices rising from $170 for a 64 GB DDR5 kit to at least $600. However, Santos says that if you want to get your upgrades, it's better to act fast. When faced with a question regarding memory shortages that could potentially extend into 2027 (oh, joy) and how to navigate rising prices, Santos said: \"For consumers that are interested in getting a new PC or upgrading their current system’s GPU, SSD or R…",

Eight years ago, a video titled \"Why I don't play video games anymore\" was uploaded to the PewDiePie channel, explaining the reasons behind the lack of Let's Play videos. Since then, his channel has adapted into more lifestyle blogging and the occasional hobby vlog. Of course, there are a few games sprinkled in, with the most recent video featuring Geoguessr. But aside from that, it's not the content you would've expected to see ten years ago. There's a good reason for this though, which PewDiePie explains in the November Kjellberg Mail newsletter. He shared, \"Since becoming a dad, everything does get evaluated differently. Every hour has weight now in a way it didn't before. One of the biggest things I decided to drop was videogames.

This was with a turnover of nearly $82 million (70.7 million euros), leaving the company with more debt than equity. The future of its Peripherals division is also uncertain, and that's why it's hard to predict what will even happen to these keyboards in the future. According to Heise , Cherry is considering selling either its Peripherals division, which includes all its keyboards and mice, or the Digital Health & Solutions division. Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general \"peripherals\" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.

In both cases, we're talking about chips broadly known as TPUs or tensor processing units.

By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs, even its AI-specific GPUs as opposed to its gaming GPUs, are more general purpose in nature. The parallel here is bitcoin mining, which used to be done on graphics cards before a new generation of dedicated mining chips, also ASICs, came along and did the same job much more efficiently.
