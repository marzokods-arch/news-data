      "body": "We've known for some time that Arc Raiders' \"Cold Snap\" winter event was on the horizon, but now exactly when it's happening. According to an Embark X post , the Cold Snap update arrives Tuesday, December 16. According to Embark's official Arc Raiders roadmap , the Cold Snap update brings a new map condition called snowfall, the \"Flickering Flames\" event, a new raider deck (basically a battle pass), and new quests. Players have speculated about what exactly the snowfall map condition will entail (is it just the same maps but with snow?), but a teaser image shared by Embark today of a collapsed raider in the snow suggests the extreme temperatures will carry consequences. It looks like players might have to limit their exposure to the elements to avoid freezing to death, or perhaps toss an incendiary grenade to warm up. That's the most obvious way to make heat a factor of survival, but I wonder if Embark would go even further—what if wearing warmer clothes, like a fur jacket, increased your heat resistance? That'd instantly plunge Arc Raiders into the realm of pay-to-win cosmetics, so consider it unlikely, but it would be an interesting wrinkle. 16.12.25 pic.twitter.com/UxQH0nAP1L D…",

The Netflix disdain was expressed in an investors Q&A earlier this week, when a caller asked if the WBD acquisition would \"enhance or accelerate\" Netflix's gaming ambitions, which have floundered after a hard-charging start: Netflix has closed or sold off the studios it made such a big point of having just a few years previously, and it's biggest idea these days seems to be laying out huge amounts of money for generative AI . Warner, on the other hand, despite some recent major botches of its own, still brings significant gaming strength to the table. That doesn't seem to figure into Netflix's plans, though.

Before that, it made a reboot of Modern Warfare 3 in 2023 just a year after its reboot of Modern Warfare 2 (2022). The repetition has created a strong sense of fatigue among parts of the player base, which Activision cited (indirectly) as a factor of today's decision. \"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental.

That's the good news—the bad news is that it, along with Obsidian's popular sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds , is being delisted on December 15. \"Hey folks, I need to bring some unfortunate news,\" king_kunat shared in a message on the GOG forums . \"Both The Outer Worlds and Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey will be removed from the store on December 15th (I don't have an exact hour yet). We've secured a discount for Ancestors, but couldn't do so for The Outer Worlds. This also includes all editions & add-ons for both games.\" A GOG rep later confirmed with PC Gamer that both games are going away as specified. Both expressed hope that GOG will be able to bring the games back at some point in the future, but the likelihood of a return is unknown. So is the reason for their removal, although the hope is that it's simply a matter of housekeeping.

PCG's Ted Litchfield recently spoke to a number of Bethesda worthies, including design director Emil Pagliarulo, and a common theme among all of them was admiration for the quality of the show. In most circumstances you'd put this down to company people saying the right thing about a company product, but the thing is that the Fallout TV show's first season was great . I ended up watching it with my partner, who isn't exactly into sprawling brown RPGs, and by the end she was enraptured by the depth and weirdness of this take on the post-apocalypse. \"It's really fascinating that the show is part of our lore,\" says Pagliarulo. \"It's connected to the games, it's by having the show set, I think it's nine years after Fa…",

But worst of all is an annoying stutter that I've encountered on PC. Every minute or two, my client will lock up for a handful of frames, a problem I haven't had once previously in 80+ hours of play. Battlefield Studios has acknowledged this new bug as well, and for now, one possible workaround is to shut down your Steam friends list (assuming that's the platform you're playing on). A workaround that seems to help some players on Steam is to go offline in the friends menu.

It looks instead to be a tease for the next game from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. Before Larian became known to the world as the developer of Baldur's Gate 3, you see, it was known to RPG nerds as the developer of the Divinity games. The series goes all the way back to 2002 with Divine Divinity, Larian's second game, and stretches to the 2017 release Divinity: Original Sin 2 , one of the best RPGs to come along in years and recipient of our 2017 Game of the Year award . Which brings us to now. As noticed by MP1st , a new European trademark filing for something called Divinity was made today by a German law firm that's previously filed trademark applications for other Larian games. (Image credit: Larian Studios (via EUIPO)) Where things really take a turn, though, is in the appearance of a separate filing, made at the same time by the same firm, that doesn't carry the name but does look awfully familiar: (Image credit: Larian Studios (via EUIPO)) Cast your memory back to that big statue in the d…",

Each day, customers will rock up and require your skills when it comes to their rundown electronics, and it's your job to fix them. This will involve taking them apart, cleaning them up, diagnosing and mending the issue before giving them back. These repairs look incredibly in-depth as well. It's not just a case of giving everything a good dust after you've taken its screws out; you really have to get into every nook and cranny.

However, it's quite a deceptive first look. Initially, I thought I was looking at a sweet bug-catching simulator, but it quickly pulls in dating sim elements in a significant change of pace. As you run around, you will in fact catch bugs, but it's what you do with them after that gets me excited to play. Once you've successfully tracked and captured your insect of choice, you'll get to pop it into a jar with another bug and watch what is essentially a first date play out. The example given in the trailer shows a butterfly and a slug coming together for dinner, but as you watch them interact it turns out there are by no means a compatible pair. So, it's your job as the bug catcher overlord to find the perfect match for each insect. As you watch these date sequences, bugs will express their likes and dislikes, such as a hard shell or a certain amount of eyes. You know, all those features you probably think of every…",

Though saying that, it might just be me: the trailer alone had me on the verge of tears. In the reveal trailer, we're welcomed to the setting of a summer camp called Camp Pals and given a brief look at what to expect from a day there. While exploring, you'll meet a cast of unique characters to befriend, but unlike what we're used to in a lot of other games, it won't be as straightforward as going up and introducing yourself. This is where the game's premise of finding new ways to communicate with other characters rather than just relying on dialogue comes in. From what we've seen in the trailer, this includes using communication cards dictating actions like \"play\" and \"dance\", or developing bonds by completing tasks for new friends such as finding a missing charm.

      "body": "While the February 27 release of Resident Evil Requiem is just a couple months away, we've only learned a few scraps of information about its plot, premise, and characters since its Summer Game Fest reveal. This week, that's changed ahead of schedule, thanks to Sony leaking details about Requiem's cast via the PlayStation store (via IGN ). Earlier today, players who've purchased non-deluxe edition digital copies of Resident Evil Requiem through the PlayStation store and checked for preload details were suddenly treated to updated cover art for the game. And that updated art just so happens to prominently feature our beautiful, spin-kicking son, Leon S. Kennedy. Here's a look: (Image credit: Capcom) Leon's potential inclusion in Requiem has been the subject of speculation since before its first reveal showed the blasted remains of his old Raccoon City stomping grounds—thanks in part to known RE leaker Dusk Golem , who's claimed that Leon is \"not the only playable character, but he is the main character.\" Until now, Capcom has remained thoroughly insistent that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, even as early demos left some of us—like PC Gamer's Morgan Park —with the distinct…",

Developer Riot Games released an update on December 3 that brought WASD support to certain game modes, echoing Path of Exile 2's embrace of more actiony controls in what has traditionally been a mouse-driven style of game. While that change proved to be a great success in Path of Exile's sequel, it hasn't gone quite so smoothly for Riot, with initial fears that it would unbalance the game now mostly giving way to the opposite problem: players complaining that the controls suck to use. When Riot announced the change in a blog post in August, it framed it as a way to make the game more approachable. “We’ve seen that for new players, WASD is the most familiar control scheme for PC games today, and let’s be real, a lot of us instinctively put our fingers there when coming back to League after playing something else,” the developer said. “By offering WASD as an alternate control scheme, we believe League will feel more intuitive to some players who come from other games.” Soon after the announcement, players were already spiraling into doomsday scenario…",

Apparently it has not—yes, I checked—but it has, as PC Gamer wordsmith Joshua Wolens put it in September, reached \"unprecedented levels of leaked.\" Yet somehow, it now is even more leaked. The latest leakage comes by way of PEGI , the Pan European Game Information agency, which has helpfully provided an 18 rating for something called Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced. There's little more to be gleaned from the rating at this point, except that the game has violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. (Image credit: PEGI) I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment, because as far as I know it has continued to steadfastly refuse that any of this is happening. And while I typically cast such requests into the ether with no real hope that my existence will even be acknowledged, much less responded to, in this case I feel like maybe Ubisoft is ready to throw up its hands and finally cop to the whole thing.

This fascinating action roguelike feels like a modern spin-off of 2008 god game Spore. Starting as a cute little blob creature, your goal is to survive in an increasingly dangerous ecosystem. Initially you're easy prey, but as you eat food you level up, gaining new genetic traits and (hopefully) rising to the top of the food chain. (Image credit: Odd Dreams Digital) As I set out on my first few runs, what immediately impresses me is the sheer variety of different traits, particularly because a really large selection of them are reflected visually on my creature. I can cover them in scales, fur, or an exoskeleton; give them claws, poison spit, bull horns, or spines; make them huge and lumbering or quick and tiny; and much, much more. It all combines seamlessly, both visually and mechanically—whether I've built the ultimate predator, or (more often) one of God's mistake…",

Industry sources claim Dell may raise its prices as soon as mid-December, and by as much as 20%. Lenovo on the other hand has apparently told customers that all of its current quotes will expire as of January 1, 2026 (via TrendForce ). Why? You guessed it: memory shortages and surging prices , driven by the demands of big tech's AI pipedreams. HP estimates that memory accounts for around 15 to 18% of the cost of even a fairly standard PC, with CEO Enrique Lores already warning that the second half of 2026 will be a particular challenge pricewise (via Asia Business Daily ). Seeing as PC gaming is expensive as it is, knowing further price hikes are imminent is still a bitter pill to swallow. As such, some have not been shy to voice their displeasure, with Framework for one directly criticising Dell's price hikes.

The CL100 measures 15 mm by 17 mm and fits into a slide-in tray that very much resembles a phone SIM tray.

It's almost enough to make me feel sad for a large company (almost—you shouldn't do that) to see it now hit with a 100-slide presentation on its alleged mismanagement from one of its major shareholders. 3D Investment, which holds a 14.36% stake in the company, is now looking to get other shareholders on its side. As shared here by Businesswire (thanks, Automaton ), 3D Investment states that Square Enix has, in the three years since replacing its president , been \"facing the following management issues: (i) a sluggish revenue growth rate and (ii) sluggish profit margins … More recently, SQEX HD recorded massive impairment losses on game development assets, which lack earning power, so SQEX HD is in a very serious situation.\" This is exacerbated by the fact, the shareholder argues, that Square's \"med…",

Snap to 200 hours later, and I had beaten all the Nightlords and their Everdark variants, but games were strangely easy.

Getting into a shoot-out if you're in squads isn't necessarily a death sentence, especially if you have some seasoned raiders on your side, but it can usually get pretty messy if you're in solos. I'm telling you this from experience.

The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix.

      "body": "Horse armor isn't usually a top priority for Minecraft players, but given how strong netherite horse armor is, it's worth looking into at the very least. Netherite horse armor takes a significant amount of work, but it's well worth it. If you're bringing the same horse out each time you adventure, you'll want to keep it safe, and given the fact netherite is the strongest material in the game, it'll more than do the trick. Unlike all other armor, netherite has no durability either, so you know that once you've made it, you probably won't have to again, which is a huge plus for the material. You can also equip it on any adult horse, including zombie horses, which come with their own added perk. So, if you're convinced to give the craft a go, here's how you can make it. How to craft netherite horse armour in Minecraft (Image credit: Mojang) If you want to get ahold of netherite horse armor in Minecraft, you'll need a set of diamond horse armor first . Take the armor, a netherite ingot, and a netherite upgrade to a smithing table in order to craft the netherite horse armor. When equipped to a horse, this will provide 19 armor points, 3 armor toughness, and 10% knockback resistance. Wh…",

That's right, the spear is here courtesy of the Mounts of Mayhem drop, and don't let its simplicity fool you—there's a lot to love about this little weapon. Working out how to craft a spear is incredibly easy, depending on which material you want to use for it, but it can be a little tricky to master its moveset. It packs a serious punch within its attacks, and requires a little more training than just swinging a sword around. Here's everything you need to know about how to create one and how you can make the most of its moves. How to craft a spear in Minecraft (Image credit: Mojang) To craft a spear in Minecraft, you need two sticks and your chosen material. Place one stick in the bottom left corner, one in the middle row and center square, plus your material in the top right corner. It's essential that these materials are placed diagonally, since if you place them vertically, you'll end up with a shovel which won't do much damage to your enemies. Much like every other tool in Minecraft, there are various different forms for you to choose from, but since wood is th…",

If you've been waiting for an excuse to finally explore underwater, then finding a Nautilus might be your key to success. But, much like a lot of Minecraft's underwater mobs, they can be quite challenging to track down, let alone tame. With how much of a Minecraft world is covered in ocean, tracking a Nautilus can seem quite intimidating. However, there's actually a pretty solid method you can follow if you're stuck on where to start looking. Here's what you need to do if you want to get an underwater mount for yourself, and how you can tame it once and for all. Where to find Nautilus in Minecraft Nautilus spawn in all ocean biomes in Minecraft, including frozen and warm, which makes the job of hunting one down a little easier. With that said, they don't appear at the surface, and you'll have to delve beyond level 38 to find one . Fortunately, they tend to spawn in groups of two or three, so if you find one, the chances you'll encounter a few extra to tame are high too.

The \"work in progress\" video purports to be a recording of a display screen, rather than a direct capture, so the quality isn't great and, more importantly, it's trickier to suss out whether it's AI generated. But it has long-suffering Shenmue fans hopeful: It's been six years since Shenmue 3 dropped (which happened a full 18 years after Shenmue 2), and while Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has previously expressed a desire to make a new game in the series , there's been no movement toward that actually happening. It sure sounds like that remains the case. \"Ys Net Inc has confirmed that a video has been posted on social media which uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that it is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us,\" the studio wrote on X. \"This video has absolu…",

Path of Exile 2, however, could be the game at the end of Rogers' \"quest to make the perfect ARPG,\" he told PC Gamer in a recent interview. Despite its differences to PoE 1, some of which have gone away over the last year in early access, \"it was never really about making it feel distinct,\" he says. In the last year, Grinding Gear Games has been navigating the treacherous waters of making a sequel that veers pretty far away from the vibe of the first game. If PoE 1 is a rampage through thousands of monsters, PoE 2 is a dance with far fewer, but more threatening monsters—a fundamental shift in the feel of the game. And not everyone has been a fan of the pivot, especially when any class that feels remotely like PoE 1 inevitably gets gutted in a patch. PoE 1 veterans want to feel like gods and go fast in the new game; Rogers wants combat to feel methodical. …",

It was immediately clear that Wiebe loves Portal. He worked on the first iteration of Battlefield 6's level editing/publishing platform during Battlefield 2042 development, back when the toolset was, in his words, \"more like a Battlefield builder than anything.\" In that game, Portal was squarely focused on mashing up different eras of Battlefield. You could pit futuristic jets versus WW2 planes, summon bots, and tweak rules to your heart's content, but without complex scripting or the ability to place new geometry, its creative ceiling was low. \"The people were phenomenal at stretching what we had built to do some amazing things, but they had to really work hard,\" Wiebe told PC Gamer.

Oh yeah, there's also the three other games the company has in development: horror title OD, espionage game PhysInt, and an untitled collaboration with Niantic (of Pokemon GO fame). Kojima's been doing a round of interviews to see out the year, and the latest with the Japanese outlet Ananweb sees him reflecting on all of these game projects. As ever, Kojima says he doesn't think of Death Stranding 2 as \"finished\" because \"I actually wanted to continue until around September.\" Kojima says that the studio's games \"have to be unique and sell to a certain extent. This is difficult. Our previous game, Death Stranding, was too unique, so we had to carefully adjust the balance to broaden the audience for this one.\" The example he gives is a snowy mountain that's twice as high as anything in the previous game: \"When we gathered monitors and played it for the first time, everyone…",

Verified Link: Steam There's a simple reason: I never trusted I could do it without exploding my whole skeleton. Nevertheless I behold the skateboard with a kind of talismanic reverence. It's an implement that grants a different relationship with our earthly geometry. Skating is an almost occultic discipline, its practitioners defying worldly convention to dabble in transcendent matters of slope, rotation, and bodily contortion. Skate Story takes that to an extreme. If Dante Alighieri had known that skateboarding could be a weapon of metaphysical rebellion against hell and reality itself, his Inferno would also have followed a \"demon made of glass and pain\" who's entered into a contract with the Devil to eat the moon in exchange for their soul. Skate Story is one of the best-sounding and most stylish games I've played in recent memory. It's an…",

As someone who was skeptical of the value of the Expedition in Arc Raiders at first, I'm more surprised than anyone that I actually kind of like Embark's approach to the rewards now it's revealed what we're getting . You earn a special bragging rights skin for completing the base Expedition , along with 12 slots of permanent extra stash space, but also temporary boosts to XP, repairs, and Scrappy materials next season. In a sense, you trade all of this for the things you lose, such as blueprints, quest progress, and workbench upgrades. We also get up to five skill points above the level cap for every new Raider we start, at the cost of $1 million per point in coins and stash value when the Expedition leaves.

Allegedly stated in two internal memos seen by Business Insider, Meta is reportedly pushing back the glasses to \"get the details right\". These memos are said to state that Meta needs \"breathing room\" in order to put out a \"fully polished\" device. It was originally suggested to launch in the latter half of 2026. Reports suggest Meta's MR glasses are a bit closer to goggles and even come with a power puck, like the Apple Vision Pro. If true, this would tether the device somewhat but could also allow for a more lightweight feel in the headset itself. With the current state of AI, and worries around privacy that come from someone being able to capture or stream any moment for any reason, I don't think I'm particularly excited for a world with more smart glasses in it.
