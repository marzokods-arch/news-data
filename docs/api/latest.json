That's where design documents come in—living, comprehensive treatises that outline all a game's systems and design goals to be referenced by those working on the game—at least, for some. Johan Andersson, lead on Europa Universalis 5, said in an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens that the practice can be too rigid and restraining. For Paradox Tinto, good design comes with a bit of democracy. \"Design documents stifle creativity and it reduces people's ownership and empowerment,\" Andersson said. \"You create better games by talking with your team … tell the person some broad outlines, like 'we want this,' 'it should function like this,' a few samples, and let them make the detailed decisions.

Kato and her commenters speak Japanese, and I didn't feel like I'd get anything worthwhile out of YouTube's auto-translation feature (which presumably draws from already-garbled auto-generated captions), but there's a universal language of horror at work here that makes the stream very easy to follow regardless. Whether Kato's pulling away from the screen in a tense moment, mimicking her character's actions in real life, or struggling to line up a fiddly action button prompt during a chase sequence, we've all been there playing a horror game.

And while it's nice to know Boltgun 2 is in development, it's nicer to know a bit about what it will actually contain. The latest trailer does just that, by informing us that Boltgun 2 will let us choose a second playable character. That character being Nyra Veyrath, a Celestian of the Sisters of Battle, to be specific. She wields a bolt pistol/power sword combo, switching to a meltagun or flamer when the enemies of the Imperium need a good superheating, and has some good mobility, with a slide move I couldn't imagine the bulky space marine Malum Caedo pulling off. As well as letting us choose between two protagonists, Boltgun 2 will have a branching campaign, with different decisions leading you through different levels. It'll also have more biomes than the first game, including a jungle swamp and a hive city to fight through. Looks like there's an ice world too? I just hope I don't get lost in the levels as often as I did in the original. Boltgun 2 will be out in 2026, and available on Steam . I'm sure the internet will be completely normal abou…",

Today on Oct. 26, that number hit a screaming high of over 300,000 simultaneous players, according to SteamDB . When PC Gamer news writer Lincoln Carpenter gave the game a spin, he conceded he thought the game was an elaborate bit at first. It won him over, though, as he said his impressions: \"Under its deceptive meme game veneer, Escape From Duckov is an excellent topdown shooter that smartly repackages the extraction shooter in a satisfying singleplayer format.\" Singleplayer extraction shooter might sound like a bit of an oxymoron—the genre is all about evading other players to escape with your life and loot—but Duckov is stuffed with all sorts of quests and a base to kit out with upgrades, essentially squeezing the genre into the framework of a roguelite RPG. There's also fishing , love it or hate it . If it's true that Team Soda's angle was to inject a little virality into their game with the satirical title and cutesy animals, then b…",

But before it had solidified that reputation, it was trying to make a name in other genres. Trying, and failing spectacularly. In an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens , Andersson recalled one of the studio's earliest games: \"If you want to laugh, Google Valhalla Chronicles. We had the best comment ever on that one: 'bugs, many and diverse, some more interesting than the gameplay.'\" It's not a looker. But as Andersson explained, the team was \"doing multiple games at the same time\" and its take on a Baldur's Gate-inspired RPG \"did not turn out great. \"We did a lot of games with a small team of like five, six people for the first, like 10 years,\" he said. \"We became Paradox in 1999 and Paradox Interactive in 2005.

No videogame genre has birthed more bangers than the humble JRPG. I mean, come on, can you even imagine a world where a track like One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy 7 doesn't exist? Or where we never got to hear a real monk chanting absolute bars over Metaphor: ReFantazio's orchestral battle theme? A timeline where we never get to experience the delicate piano of Kingdom Hearts' Dearly Beloved washing over us when booting up the game? I certainly can't, which is why I maintain that JRPG music is some of the best in the biz. It kind of has to be, really. Not only will they probably be some of the longest videogames you ever play—hello to my triple-digit Persona 5 Royal playtime—but they'll also probably take you through every feeling you could ever experience.

From the first moment you step foot on Paradise Island, you'll start discovering all sorts of strange murder contraptions, from a sniper rifle that fires sneaky explosive bolts you detonate when you reload, to a pistol that infects enemies with a contagious disease they can spread. The strangest weapon by far that I've discovered in my travels through Arcadia, though, is a sword that turns combat into a rhythm game. Yes, you read that correctly—if you don't slash and slice to the old timey beat, you won't gain its bonus. This sword might seem like a bit of a meme at first, but when fully powered up, I'm convinced it might be the best melee weapon in the game. The Spectrum Dance Saber, as it's called, is quite hard to get. You'll first have to complete an elaborate collectible quest to unlock it, and even then it'll set you back 16,500 bits , making it by far the most expensive weapon I've found in the game.

Two players might come to a mission having had very different experiences leading up to it, and having different amounts of patience for a game slowing down to drop narrative on them. \"Our approach is to just add it piece by piece,\" Magnuson said, \"and build the narrative as little puzzle pieces that slowly fall together and then you see…",

DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems.

In 2010, before League of Legends and Dota 2 had become the esports institutions they are now, there was Heroes of Newerth. Before it shut down in 2022 , it was a relic of a time when MOBAs hadn't really proved their staying power yet; and now, somehow, it's back. First announced nine months ago , Heroes of Newerth: Reborn is a relaunch-slash-remaster of the defunct MOBA. A trailer dropped Wednesday announcing a free open beta starting on Nov. 11, and it certainly looks like HoN. While League of Legends was a fully original game with its own heroes and items, HoN was much closer to DotA (albeit with a trashier sense of humor). In May 2010, Dota was still just an old Warcraft 3 mod, so HoN had its niche among players who didn't like League's snappier, skill shot-oriented action. All this makes the re-release sort of a headscratcher for any outside of Newerth's niche fanbase. If you long to play Dota, it's one of the biggest games on Steam—a platform Reborn is completely forgoing in favor of Juvio. If you're wonde…",

A hammer with a slot machine built into it that randomly rewards you jackpots. A cowboy hat that boosts damage by 99% if you wait six seconds without shooting anyone in combat. It's a great thing, quite frankly, that The Outer Worlds 2 is leaning so heavily into the absurdity of its setting, trying to provide the kind of weird and wacky build options you'd see in Borderlands 4. Still, the strangest helmet I've come across in my travels through outer space is by far A New Point of View Mk 2. This fancy dome-protector is relatively tough to acquire and you'll miss it entirely (along with a bunch of other strange gear) if you don't complete a specific collectible quest. It's well worth it, though, for its defining feature: it changes the visual style of the game entirely.

In a post on X , Griesemer reposted gameplay footage saying, \"You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot.\" Tagging Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto, he added, \"What have they done to beloved B30?!\" You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters.

In the 2010s, when Telltale started releasing all of its games episodically, it was novel. It was also before streamers took over TV and dumped entire seasons on us instantly. Now the streamers have started to go back to traditional release schedules, but it still seemed wrong to have to wait to enjoy more of a game. It's finished. It's ready.

Turns out it's mostly popular in China, which is becoming more and more common on Steam—but it's still a total upset of the usual trending game pattern, because Duckov is a singleplayer game with an $18 price tag. (Image credit: Team Soda) Since its launch this week, most of Escape From Duckov's players are in China: You can clearly spot that its player count ( via Steam.db ) spikes in the evenings for China's timezone (about half its peak count happening at 10pm Pacific) and that 64% of its user reviews on Steam are in Chinese. It's not uncommon for games to have a huge audience in a different market, but when Chinese players rocket a new release to the top of the charts it's usually a free-to-play online game.

As PC Gamer's Rory Norris described it last week, \" Battlefield 6 can be blindingly white at times , especially when looking/moving in or out of buildings. It's like my soldier's eyes are adjusting to the light in real time, but it instead causes my own retina to burn when viewing bright areas, or trick me into thinking I've gone blind when transitioning to dark areas.\" That's not great when everyone in your vicinity is doing their damnedest to shoot you.

Three leap out as particularly common—the lack of dynamic music (which the original game had), no online multiplayer, and allegations (unsubstantiated, as far as I know) of AI-generated or upscaled art assets—and as usual, words like \"lazy\" and \"cash grab\" abound. More generally (and thoughtfully), though, there's just a broad sense of dissatisfaction with the remaster's attention to detail. The reaction reflects the risk of remastering a much-loved game like Plants vs. Zombies—and, for those who weren't hip to the scene 16 years ago, PvZ is much loved.

The Pro 3 looks delightful, both on and off its charging stand, and that charging stand adds more than just an ornament to a room.

So I was ready to play Bye Sweet Carole the moment I saw its old-style, beautiful 2D animation, choosing to disregard the warning that it was also a horror game. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Maximum Entertainment ) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Maximum Entertainment ) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Maximum Entertainment ) There aren't many signs that Bye Sweet Carole is much of a horror game at first. Finding yourself in a quaint flower garden, talking to cute little birds, and chasing a rascal rabbit that has stolen an important letter you were reading, you run across fields of flowers and bask in the glory of Bunny Hall, an old, seemingly well-kept estate. I was enjoying every second of this brief introduction, feeling as if I were playing through one of my favourite childhood memories. But this is a horror game after all, so that feeling of contentment was rather short-lived. Soon enough, …",

Well, turns out it wasn't meant to be that way. Alright, context: In Borderlands 4 , The Cindershelly is one of those gag items that tends to make its way into every entrant. Given each game has 87 bazillion guns (give or take a bazillion), shields and mods to loot, Gearbox likes to sneak in a few dashes of joke sauce to its equipment soup. The bit this time? The shield doms you. You take damage or do anything, and the Cindershelly will let you know that you're subhuman scum. Here are a couple of sample lines, courtesy of our poor put-upon guides writer, Rory Norris, who had some things to say about it last month : \"Touch that barrel and scream for me\" \"Did you let go without asking first?\" \"Don't stop till I allow it\" \"Worship me\" \"Show me how close you can get, worm\" \"What an obedient worm you are\" As Rory explained, the shield was very chatty. Too chatty, in fact, as the problem \"only gets worse in combat, where these voice lines trigger even more often, like if you take damage or kill enemies. In some cas…",

      "body": "I kinda like 'ugly' hardware. The first time I saw the Edifier G2000 Pro, that was exactly what I thought. It's an angular set of speakers, with see through panels on the side to blast RGB light into your eyeballs. It feels very 2000s to me, in a way I haven't experienced with any of the speakers I've tested over the last few years. With a depth of connectivity options and that look, it already stood out, but $200 is a decent chunk of cash to spend, and we buy tech for more than just the look. And the answer to 'does it sound good?' ends up far more nuanced than I thought it would after my testing. The G2000 Pro's pretty iconic look is both a big positive and a negative. It's true that among your audiophile friends (assuming you have some), this will be one of the most 'out there' set of speakers. They have a radical angular design, plus a ring in the centre of the see-through plastic that is covered in RGB-lit lines. Powering the G2000 Pro on feels like an event in itself, bathing bright colourful lights into the room. It is truly striking. However, it can also be kind of annoying, as that colour is very bright and pulsing. Holding down the G button on the right-hand side turns o…",

That's basically the gist of what I had to deal with when diving into my first trip alongside fellow PCG writers Kara and Elie: a Peak-adjacent co-op adventure where—instead of climbing up treacherous mountains and fighting for survival—we're forced to haul a metal piece of crap over rocky terrain and down narrow winding paths to reach our destination. (Image credit: Nuggets Entertainment) The whole thing's a game jam put together by Nuggets Entertainment, so things are a little janky right now. I regularly found myself clipping out of the RV which almost spelled my death on a couple of occasions, items we'd packed along for the trip would randomly vanish, and I sometimes would end up defying gravity when grabbing the winch, leaving me floating around in mid-air. But despite its rough edges, the whole thing is darn fun. After packing the RV with epi-pens (for untimely deaths), beers (for strength), and a cassette tape (for the love of…",
