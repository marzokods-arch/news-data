Kravitz's role in the game was presumably meant to be revealed at tonight's Game Awards, but slipped out early in a now-deleted message posted to the official 007 X account— whoops : \"He rose from nothing, broke free, and built his own Kingdom of Aleph. Introducing Bawma, the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere who's as charismatic as he is unpredictable.\" \"I am sometimes asked: 'Bawma, how is it that you hear every whisper in every corner?'\" Kravtiz croons in Bawma's big reveal, which has also been taken down but remains available for viewing on other, unofficial sites. \"And I answer, 'I have built Aleph with my will, my blood, my whole self.

The whole point of the mode, Blizzard says, is wild, frenetic fun: getting super powerful and collecting every transmog armor appearance, pet, mount, and toy an expansion offers in a short period of time. But the decisions the company makes about the mode, including the most recent update, are often not in support of that goal. Players level up their strength so fast and so far in Remix that they're ridiculously overpowered, tackling even the toughest group content in the game solo, romping through old dungeons and raids as if they were new-player zones. In the current Legion Remix, players are called Timerunners, and the same buff they build up to become OP levelers and fighters also gives them a speed buff—they literally dash everywhere they go. So far, so good. Go fast! But not that fast (Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) But even when the first Mists of Pandaria Remix debuted last year, there were signs of trouble on the horizon.

Case in point, the Zotac Magnus EN mini workstation with RTX 5060 Ti, which seems to power that GPU via the PCIe connector, and not in the same way as Asus BTF cards and motherboards. The mini PC was disassembled and inspected by HKEPC , then brought to my attention by Unikoshardware and Wccftech . Apart from how impressive it is to be able to fit a discrete desktop RTX 5060 Ti into such a small chassis at all, one thing that sticks out is the complete lack of a power cable for the GPU. Looking at GPU-Z shows something interesting: \"Bus interface: PCIe x8 5.0 @ x8 5.0.\" Normally, for an RTX 5060 Ti, it would just show x 5.0. While I'm not sure what the \"@\" is all about, that's basically hinting that the x16 PCIe fingers are split into two batches of x8. And upon closer inspection of the graphics card, it is in fact split in two. As Uniko and Wccf point out, the split-off part gets fed a 19 V input, as they're not being used for…",

The Ayaneo Pocket Play is a smartphone with a sliding display that can be pushed up to reveal a d-pad, AXBY face buttons, and two virtual joystick touchpads. Ayaneo had previously teased this gaming-geared phone early last month . Now, there's a fresh blog post in Ayaneo's typically effusive style about the Pocket Play, plus a Kickstarter page . However, tech specs remain thin on the ground. We don't yet know what processor this bad boy will end up boasting, or even the device's display dimensions. However, given that Ayaneo is known for Android-based gaming handhelds such as the Snapdragon-based Ayaneo Pocket S , perhaps I won't need all three guesses to figure out this phone's headlining hardware specs. So, like most of its ilk, it will likely be an Android device. That means we won't be able to play our precious PC games on it without an emulator, such as Winlator, which is a bit of a job to set up. At least other forms of Android emulation are generally excellent these days. Though there's no gesture at a release window beyond the words 'coming soon,' I'm already intrigued.

I joke (kind of), this small update dishes out some fixes for maps like Stella Montis and Blue Gate, as well as notifying us of some upcoming changes to the update schedule. Patch 1.6.0 targets four specific issues: Removing the zipline on Stella Montis that lets players go out of bounds. Fixing a collision that let players get through a wall in Blue Gate. Fixing material issues, which meant bullets or arcs' vision weren't blocked by some objects. Patching a gap at the Spaceport Launch Tower, which allowed players to get shot through a wall. I've had a couple of problems here and there with arc's vision or bullets not properly being blocked, although I chalked up my issues to the character movement latency that plagued my games at launch. Although this was fixed a month ago and I haven't had any issues since then. I'm also sad to see another wall exploit kick the bucket after the infamous door glitch was patched out , but I suppose it's for the best. \"We also want to give you a quick update on the patch cadence in the com…",

Now a new sentence has emerged: Magic: The Gathering's new Marvel set has a combo where you make the Incredible Hulk so, so very angry by forcing the poor guy to step on spiky caltrops over and over and over again, hurting his poor feetsies. As spotted by Wargamer , you do need to put in a little work here—the card starts off as an un-crashed out Bruce Banner that has to be transformed with six mana.

If he's attacking, untap him and there is an additional combat phase after this phase.\" Combine this with Caltrops, which deals one damage when a creature attacks, and you start to see the vision: The Hulk crashes into an enemy, roaring, frothing at the mouth.

Emphasis on the early phrasing there. Intrepid's Steam description (and official site) reiterates in quite a few places you're getting an unfinished build of adventures in Verra, but the whole early access thing should make that clear enough. Perhaps it's just hammering home Ashes of Creation is still in its second alpha build and has two beta periods planned before 1.0, whenever that is. You've got less than 24 hours left until Ashes of Creation throws the gates wide open for its early access launch. That's probably not too bad a wait if you're the type with enough patience to play various iterations of an old-school PvX MMORPG where your progression may be wiped. Ashes of Creation release time and date on Steam early access Ashes of Creation launches in early access at 10 am PST on Thursday, December 11.

More studios, more bodies, more CoD. CoD but battle royale. CoD zombies. CoD extraction. CoD on your phone. CoD but battle royale, but on your phone.

Pilestedt casually wrote in response to an X user pitching his idea for an endless mode (as spotted by GamesRadar ), as if he didn't just spill the beans on what would be the biggest shakeup to Helldivers 2 since launch. Well that's exciting. While most of us haven't taken to social media to tell Arrowhead about it, I imagine lots of fans have also wondered what an endless mode in Helldivers 2 would look like. I reckon anything resembling Gears of Wars' old Horde modes or Halo Firefight would fit nicely, though based on Pilestedt's comparison to roguelites, we can assume this prototype includes modifiers or power-ups.

This matched my own experience with the game back then. The enticing promise of a full and faithful digital recreation of D&D's 3.5 ruleset—and a chance to throw magic missiles somewhere other than the Sword Coast thanks to the game's use of the Greyhawk setting—was brought down by frustrating technical issues and odd design choices. I was never quite sure if I was doing something wrong or because the game had got its d20s in a twist again, so I quickly decided to stop playing rather than spend hours scouring forums in the hope of finding the right workaround. Which is why SNEG's re-release of this famously temperamental game, out now on Steam , is so interesting.

And, after playing an albeit too brief demo, it definitely reminded me why I love these creatures so much. There isn't much of an introduction to the demo, let alone the characters. So, if you're not super familiar with the world of Moomins you might feel a little bit out of your depth, as you're immediately introduced to Moomintroll and the gaggle of Fillyjonks' children. However, you don't really need to know the ins and outs of each character, which is one of the reasons these games are so enjoyable. You also get a feel of the characters through the dialogue alone. As Moomintroll is approached by Fillyjonks' children in the snow, they seem incredibly panicked and are quick to ask for your help.

Word of the layoffs, confirmed by multiple Glowmade employees on LinkedIn , comes just a couple months after the release of King of Meat, a \"co-op party platformer\" for up to four players. It's yet another ugly outcome for a game studio, but what makes this case particularly interesting is that the report claims \"leadership\"—whether that's at Glowmade or Amazon isn't specified—was expecting a concurrent player count for King of Meat of at least 100,000. The actual number? On Steam, it peaked at just 320, according to SteamDB, a number it only managed to achieve thanks to a free weekend. The player count quickly tailed off after that to double-digits, and at this moment sits at just 12, enough to populate three matches.

So it's definitely newsworthy that Asus has just launched what appears to be its first-ever 5K gaming monitor. That's right, 77% more pixels for your GPU to cope with. The display in question is the snappily-titled ROG Strix 5K XG27JCG , and as the name suggests, its key feature is the 5120 x 2880 IPS panel. Coming in at 27 inches in size, though, that's a lot of pixels being packed in there. Specifically, it's 218 pixels per inch, which is an absurdly high density. Pro creators never really care that much about having a display with high refresh rates, but gamers do. Fortunately, despite its immense pixel density, the ROG Strix 5K still manages to top out at 180 Hz, with FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatible VRR support, all with a grey-to-grey response time of 0.3 milliseconds. Sounds fab, right? Well, a resolution of 5120 x 2880 is 77% more pixels than 4K, so you can well imagine how hard it would be for any GPU to run a game at this level.

Speaking of offerings, Razer is only offering 1,337—uh, huh—units of the Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition. So, if you want one, well, you know what to do. Putting the FOMO aside for a moment, the original Boomslang offered 2,000 DPI mechanical ball tracking (actually, the original-original Boomslang was 1,000 DPI and predates 2005, more on which in a moment) that was ground-breaking at the time. The new model ups that to fully 45,000 DPI, then throws in 8,000 Hz polling and optical switches with claimed 100 million click lifespan for good measure. Oh, and where the OG Boomslang was wired, this reboot is inevitably wireless and comes with what Razer describes as a dock with \"next-gen\" charging. Physically, the basic ambidextrous design looks to have been carried over largely untouched. But visible stitching on the buttons betray that it's been, \"enhanced with PU leather-w…",

With Asetek's 20-year patent on AIO coolers expiring earlier this year, the market has seen a flood of new models, all at vastly reduced prices. That's been good for us PC builders. However, for cooling companies, it's become increasingly harder to make something that stands out from the crowd. Enter stage left, the Jonsbo TF3-360SCB , which (to quote the great Marge Simpson) I think is just neat.

What tends to emerge from their 3D printer are claws, teeth, and horns—but I don't doubt that even they wouldn't mind a few more colourful filaments among their 3D printing palette. Enter Noctua and Prusa Research, announcing two new 3D printing filaments in the cooling component brand's signature shades of brown and beige. The Prusament PLA Noctua Beige and Prusament PLA Noctua Brown filaments are already available via Prusa Research , costing $33/£31/€33 for each 1 kg spool. It feels a bit weird to be a fan of, well, a fan brand, but Noctua clearly knows what it has with that colour scheme (white and dark chocolate-themed PC components, mmm). As such, it's no surprise that this collaboration's main selling point is 3D printing parts for your own brown-n-beige Noctua build. Prusa Research's CEO and founder, Josef Prusa, commented, \"Building your own PC has always been quite common here in the Czech Republic, and I remember using Noctua fans in my own builds back in the day.

Better known as FSR 'Redstone', the work done here essentially brings AMD on par with Nvidia and Intel, in terms of applying AI to upscaling, frame generation, and other rendering technologies. However, it's worth pointing out now that AMD still doesn't have multi-frame generation, so it's not quite at the same level. It's also a little too early to tell whether the new FSR frame generation is as good as DLSS MFG or XeSS-MFG in terms of image quality, and that's because it only works on a relatively small number of games.

Kicking off with handheld gaming, Microsoft says key improvements include the full screen experience (FSE) that debuted on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally . That's designed to enable a more consistent, \"console-like\" experience while also minimising background tasks for better frame rates. Advanced Shader Delivery (ASD) also debuted on the Xbox Ally.

But it's also flaky as all hell with strange bugs and, despite the whole reason for its existence being that it's supposedly a versatile 3-in-1 device, it resolutely fails to convince in pretty much any of those formats. Like the older, Meteor Lake-powered OneXPlayer X1 , this is a device designed to operate as a standard (although very thick) PC tablet, with a laptop-esque form thanks to its magnetically attaching keyboard and touchpad, and as a handheld gaming PC with a pair of clip-on controllers. And, inevitably, that desire for flexibility hobbles each option in different ways. I was genuinely hoping that things would be different this time around, but it feels like OneXPlayer has not learned the lessons from the original device and is determined to make the same mistakes.

We all knew that Rogue was going to be a bit of a monster as soon as it was confirmed that Gambit would be taking the Strategist bullet , as her powers are no joke. But I'm happy/terrified to confirm that her bark really is as bad as her bite with this one. Aside from appearing as a brawl tank, Rogue's main ability allows her to steal other enemy heroes' powers. These are all the powers we know she can steal so far: Thor's awakening state Doctor Strange's shield Groot's walls Emma Frost's diamond state One of Phoenix's attacks Iron Fist's healing Psylocke's invisibility Invisible Woman's projectile punches Loki's healing lamps It's a hell of a roster of powers to choose from, but unfortunately, you won't be able to use all of these in one match, well, not unless the enemy team keeps changing heroes to include one of these characters. As before, Rogue can use a stolen power; she has to steal it. It doesn't look like the process of stealing powers ac…",

According to Embark's official Arc Raiders roadmap , the Cold Snap update brings a new map condition called snowfall, the \"Flickering Flames\" event, a new raider deck (basically a battle pass), and new quests. Players have speculated about what exactly the snowfall map condition will entail (is it just the same maps but with snow?), but a teaser image shared by Embark today of a collapsed raider in the snow suggests the extreme temperatures will carry consequences. It looks like players might have to limit their exposure to the elements to avoid freezing to death, or perhaps toss an incendiary grenade to warm up. That's the most obvious way to make heat a factor of survival, but I wonder if Embark would go even further—what if wearing warmer clothes, like a fur jacket, increased your heat resistance?
