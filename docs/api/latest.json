It's so big that the Season 1 roadmap infographic is almost illegible without a magnifying glass. So that you don't need to dig up a magnifying glass, I've already done the hard work for you. Below, I'll go over the Season 1 release time for both Black Ops 7 and Warzone, and the new content you can expect in each mode. Black Ops 7 Season 1 release date BO7 Season 1 launches on Thursday, December 4, 2025, at 9 am PT / 12 pm ET / 5 pm GMT across all platforms. This coincides with Black Ops 7's Warzone integration too, so the battle royale mode will also be getting a big overhaul on December 4. Keep in mind that Black Ops 7 continues the tradition of seasonal updates effectively coming in two halves, as the Season 1 mid-season update arrives \" in the new year \".

Farming will be the game's tenth skill, and to me, definitely the most exciting one.

While 2025's new game release calendar saw the occasional dry spell, we were never left lacking for long, and with a gauntlet of big shooter releases barely behind us, I'm ready for some downtime. I'll need it before the new 2026 games roll in. That's not to say we're totally clear of new games for the month, though. I've had my eye on a few holiday horror releases like Sleep Awake and Routine, because of course I want to celebrate the most wonderful time of the year with tales of an insomnia plague and a haunted lunar base. Then there's Skate Story—which is about a less-haunted, but equally weird, moon—and Unbeatable, a rhythmic adventure game set in a world where music is illegal. December's schedule also features the usual end-of-year shows, including our very own PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted , and The Game Awards a week after. If you're still hurting for something to do, then keep on scrollin' to the end, where I've outlined the dates for Steam's Winter sale, games with big updates on the way, and even more new releases.

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. Greetings from a post-Thanksgiving stupor, FPS enjoyers. I had a nice AFK holiday with family, but in the back of my mind I was riding the high of the night before, when my friends managed to assemble a party of nine Master Chief Collection owners (shout out to the $10 Steam sale) to play classic Halo 3 custom games. It was a blast, and if you have any fondness for early Forge creations like Halo Jenga (seen below), I can't recommend it enough. The good times got me thinking about a PC gaming maxim that says an FPS is always better with mouse and keyboard. I was diehard about this for a long time—plenty of shooters feel fine on a controller, but I couldn't imagine a scenario where the precision of a mouse isn't a demonstrably better experience than thumbsticks. Recently, I've loosened my grip on that perspective. Yes, the mouse reigns supreme when speed and precision are major factors in a shooter, and that is often the case. Echo Po…",

Dark Souls has plenty of bosses to borrow from and the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is full of weapons that would transform how you approach each run. The beauty of Nightreign is the randomization of the items you find and the bosses you face, so even a slight update could change a lot. These are the things we'd like to see added (and not added) to the game to make the next 300 or so hours even more fun than before. Let me kick Libra to death (Image credit: FromSoftware) Sean Martin, Senior Guides Writer : Playing as fist Raider in Deep of Night has really given me an appreciation for how every problem can be solved with punching, but we're still missing some of the best hand-to-hand weapons in Elden Ring.

Paralives has been in development for quite a few years at this point, and it will initially launch into early access while continuing to work on expanding the possibilities of its Live Mode simulation.

But finally, finally , one heroic modder has added video poker. And New Vegas, at last, feels more like Present Vegas as a result. The mod by W00Z, called wGames - Introducing Video Poker , adds a classic of the video poker genre: Jacks or Better. Belly up to the machine, place a bet, and you'll be dealt five cards. Click the ones you want to hold and you'll be given new cards to replace the discarded ones. If you've got a pair of jacks, you'll win your money back. Anything higher like two-pair, three of a kind, a flush, a straight, and so on, and you'll rake in the caps.

It didn't launch in the best way, but after a year of patching I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. Then this year brought Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a ground-up but faithful remake of the beloved MGS3 that impressed almost everyone . It may not be the glorious future this series deserves, but it showed that Konami could still kick it at the top table, and produce a Metal Gear game that looks and feels like it belongs in 2025.

The two-minute reel includes finished scenes from the likes of GTA5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, alongside various one-off animations with Pixar-style cartoon characters, but it's the opening 20 seconds that's attracting all the attention. The three animations are flat-textured and set to Tom Petty's Love is a Long Road, the song featured in GTA 6's first trailer. The first shows a male character removing what seems to be the GTA 6 version of a Lime Bike from the rental rack, and then returning the bike to the same spot. Eagle-eyed fans had previously identified bike racks for some sort of rental company (which may well be called \"Lombike\"), so clearly this is another aspect of modern urban life that has found its way into the game. The other two animations show a character, which does resemble protagonist Lucia, clambering down from a truck bed first of all, before the second animation shows her hopping down from the truck roof to the truck bed, and then out to the ground. There are also a few buildings…",

How long will it take for those price changes to trickle down to the consumer market? And how long will it take for RAM prices to improve? Today's brought us a few interesting findings, so let's dig in. Starting with the NAND flash prices, TrendForce reports that the demand for NAND flash used in SSDs is strong. To the surprise of no one, that demand is largely fueled by large enterprises (thank you, AI), meaning that's where the manufacturers currently have their focus. The massive demand has led to a short supply, which then led to a price increase in November. The monthly average prices for wafers rose from 20% to 60%. Triple-level cell (TLC) memory was the most impacted. This type of NAND flash stores three bits of data per memory cell. Quad-level cell (QLC) NAND flash is also in high demand and short supply.

But today's File Explorer tests prove that there's more to it than that—Microsoft simply still has some work to do to make Windows 11 as good as it can (or even should) be. Microsoft is currently testing preloading File Explorer in the latest Insider Preview Build 26220.7271, available on the Dev and Beta channels. Windows Latest took the new improvement out for a spin, and the results are underwhelming at best. Preloading (or pre-caching) is meant to speed up the load times of File Explorer, which have, so far, been a major downgrade compared to Windows 10. Microsoft is testing loading File Explorer into local memory before you ever need it, so it loads faster when you do. Testing shows that Microsoft has succeeded, but only on paper. (Image credit: Microsoft) Windows Latest ran a bunch of test on a virtual machine limited to 4 GB RAM. Without preloading, launching File Explorer accounted for 32.4 MB of RAM, and enabling the feature nearly doubled RAM usage, bringing it up to 67.4 MB. That's negligible usage, of course, even on …",

Asked if AI is going to lead us to the sunlit uplands so many tech 'visionaries' are promising, Houser is unequivocal: \"I personally don't think it will, because I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it—which is really superficial—the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models.

The truth is, we've already had some leaks about the 9850X3D in the last few months, so we have an idea of what to expect, but none of it has come directly from AMD. At least we now know the processor exists, so chances are that the specs are real, but you never know with these leaks. Previously, another Twitter leaker, ch11eddog , said that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D would come with a 120 W TDP, eight cores and 16 threads, 96 MB of L3 cache, and a boost clock speed of 5.6 GHz.

The mod drops players into the boots of the LSPD’s most infamous unit, CRASH, in a story that blurs the line between justice and vice. The result is something gritty and unmistakably GTA, and it’s being built by two people: Cascavel, a veteran roleplayer and modder, and giacobbe, a software engineer with a lifelong love for the series. Roleplay roots For Cascavel, Blue & Blood was born out of San Andreas Multiplayer. He spent years on a text-based server called Los Santos Roleplay, crafting characters and stories with hundreds of others in real time. \"That experience made me appreciate strong writing and believable characters,\" he says.

But the shooter has just had its hull thoroughly careened, with a massive update expanding and overhauling its fundamentals in significant ways.

      "body": "While I'm well aware that finished games often rest atop a mountain of cut or heavily revised work, I'm still regularly surprised by how extensively projects can change over the course of their development. A striking example was recently provided by Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto, who revealed that Master Chief's suit design was revised nine times before Bungie settled on his final look. Lehto, who is an alumnus of Ohio's Kent State University, was speaking to Kent State Magazine (via GamesRadar ) about the impact his education had on his future career. During that interview, he chatted about the process Bungie went through to design Master Chief's armour. \"The creation of the Master Chief is something that I went through so many wringers to try to find the right look, the right feel, the right stature for such a character,\" Lehto explained. \"We tried a lot of things.\" Some of these initial designs have made it to the Internet, such as Shi Kai Wang's early concept for Master Chief. Apparently, Bungie felt those early designs were too stylised, and Lehto's later concept borrowed elements from the M1 Abrams tank and the lines of an Apache helicopter. Master Chief's helmet, meanwhile,…",

      "body": "Back in 2023, South Korean developer Wonder Potion released Sanabi , a sleek, cyberpunk-themed action platformer that saw players slinging themselves around levels with a giant grappling hook. Favourably compared to Katana Zero , it received near-universal praise for its crisp pixel art, Bionic Commando-esque platforming challenges, and surprisingly involved storyline. Two years on from Sanabi's launch, Wonder Potion has now released an expansion for Sanabi. Titled Sanabi: A Haunted Day , it’s a prequel spinoff in which you play as a different character from the main game. Also, it's completely free. Sanabi: A Haunted Day puts players in the role of Major Song, who has a minor role in the base game. As mentioned, the DLC takes place before the events of Sanabi, with Song investigating a sprawling robots scrapyard which the DLC's Steam page says is plagued by \"strange phenomena\". Alongside the new location, Song has a completely different moveset from the base game's protagonist. While she lacks a grappling hook, she is nonetheless capable of \"agile aerial manoeuvres\" such as an infinitely replenishable mid-air jump. She also wields a massive shotgun—which I always find endearing i…",

      "body": "When Games Workshop branched out into fiction it did so cautiously, with a string of short story anthologies before it committed to anything so ambitious as novels. A highlight of those anthologies were the stories about Gotrek and Felix, a duo in the sword-and-sorcery tradition, with one a homicidal maniac and the other a simple poet doomed to follow the other around recording his adventures while trying not to get killed by them. They were a perfect encapsulation of Warhammer, grim but also a bit silly, heroic but also earthy. Eventually they'd get their own novels, but first they appeared in a compilation of short stories called Trollslayer. Honestly, I don't think the Felix and Gotrek stories worked as well once they were expanded out to novel length. With a few exceptions, almost all of their best adventures were short stories like those collected in Trollslayer, which is why I'm interested in the special edition Games Workshop recently announced . The hardcover book comes with a bookmark shaped like an axe, art prints including a map of the Old World and a wanted poster for the book's ostensible heroes, two coins—a gold crown from Felix's home of the Empire, and a silver dwa…",

If you've found yourself (or someone you love (sorry)) wishing for a more material mecha pastime, Gundam plastic models—or Gunpla—will get you there. A word of warning: Gunpla sickness settles in fast. I only built my first kit about a year and a half ago, but as I write this, there are two displayed mobile suits, three assembled models in boxes, and one unopened kit awaiting assembly in my field of vision.

Fans have speculated for years as to whether he's a virus-infected mutant, a radiation-poisoned ghoul, both, or neither, and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has weighed in on the debate with a larger point: any interpretation is right, so long as it's designated as such. He said as much in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel yesterday—the same channel where he routinely shares insights and commentary from his entire body of gamedev work, including everything from the original Fallout to Wildstar and The Outer Worlds. The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't. To summarize, his argument is thus: canon is \"whatever the owner of the IP says it is,\" an individual's interpretation is personal and freeform and therefore \"you can't be wrong,\" and authorial intent is another matter altogether that usually differs from team member to team member, and may even diverge greatly from canon.

My current pair is the Audioengine HD3, which don't go on sale all that much, so the current sale price at Amazon and at Audioengine is a genuine deal. These are the speakers I currently own. They look great, and sound plenty good for the size. The connection options make them very versatile: Bluetooth, USB, RCA, and 3.5mm aux. Get a bigger pair of bookshelf speakers if you're building an audiophile hi-fi setup, but for a warm sound in a stylish form that's easy to stick on your desk and connect to your PC or phone, I'm very happy with these.
