The clip (embedded above) shows Call of Duty pro Simp using one of Blops 7's new killstreak rewards, The Gravemaker, a sniper rifle whose wielder can see, and snipe, through solid walls. The go-to joke is that Activision has given up on combating cheaters and decided to just put wallhacking into the game. I sort of get the indignation, because it doesn't look fun to be on the receiving end of a bullet that was fired through two layers of concrete by someone you never could've seen, but I also sort of don't get it, because aren't all Call of Duty killstreaks like that? How is this less fair than someone calling in an attack helicopter or carpet bombing part of the map? In some of these games you can call in a tactical nuke. A nuclear bomb! Granted, the specific post I've shared is directed at the pro scene—\"GA\" refers to a \"gentlemen's agreement\" not to use certain guns or abi…",

There were the hosts, overflowing with excitement for Black Ops 7's meager alterations to CoD's current form. There were the hyped creators in attendance, many of whose livelihoods are directly intertwined with the success of Call of Duty. And there was Black Ops 7 itself, a back-to-back sequel that not even its developers appear to feel strongly about. It was the pinnacle of videogame marketing excess: loud, abrasive, and insecure. Between extended ad reads for Little Caesars Pizza, AMD, Monster Energy, and Herman Miller chairs, we were treated to Black Ops 7 multiplayer with live commentary that fluctuated between 3 am infomercial and awkward riffing over gameplay that could easily be mistaken for the last handful of games.

Crossroads of Ravens begins as it means to go on. Chapter two opens with a description of a peasant standing in fresh cowshit to keep his feet warm. It's a book about the mud and muck of its medieval world, one that jams its characters into moral quagmires as well as physical ones. It's a prequel to the Witcher series, set shortly after Geralt finishes his training at the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen under Vesemir and is let loose into the world. He's like a fresh-faced graduate right out of the education system suddenly having to deal with an adult world he isn't prepared for.

That's true of the games, anyway, but apparently it's not the case in the books they're based on. In a new AMA on Reddit , Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski said the whole idea of individual Witcher schools is based on a mistake, and it hasn't gone away because \"videogame people\" won't let it go. \"A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish,\" Sapkowski explained. \"I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot.

She's going to have to wait a bit to embark on that particular adventure, though, as developer The Game Bakers announced today that instead of arriving on November 5 as planned, Cairn needs a little more time in the oven and will show up in early 2026 instead . The game is \"content complete,\" The Game Bakers clarified, but developers want to take a few extra weeks \"to focus on optimization, debug, and polish.\" \"Our goal has always been to create games you remember long after playing them, and for Cairn, despite our best efforts, this requires a little more time,\" the studio wrote. \"We've been running a lot of playtests, and you've let us know that we have something truly special with Cairn. Still, we also see the improvements we can still make to give you the best game we can. After five years of work, so close to our goal, we don't want to rush it.\" Delays suck (although not as much as a bad game ), but it's probably a good move if The Game Bake…",

Expectations are high for Judas, but it also has to be said that it looks a hell of a lot like another Bioshock game . In a new interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, Levine talks a little more about Judas and the similarities to his previous work: but insists it's got a whole lot more going on than plasmids and wrenches. \"There are parts of Judas that are more similar to BioShock, and there are parts of Judas that are really, really radically different,\" said Levine. \"I'm sure people notice there's a gun in one hand [and] powers [in] the other hand.

Dubbed CraftGPT, this version of the Large Language Model is decidedly compact as far as these things go, featuring only about 5 million parameters (as that's all the creator's \"poor old laptop\" could handle). However, translating that into Minecraft blocks took up a considerable amount of space. Featuring 439 million blocks, this build required the Distant Horizons mod to keep everything on screen and operational. Beyond that, sammyuri claims that this build was made using only vanilla Minecraft's own redstone mechanics.

Both of these laptops have RTX 5090s and cost thousands of dollars. Those bigger batteries are an attempt to get normal battery life out of high-end hardware.

Since then, the team's introduced player-to-player trading, a magic system, an expanded PvP area and a variety of tweaks and changes—including the world itself being transformed, to better facilitate more players and building projects. And now it's gearing up to leave early access, with the 1.0 launch set for October 16 . Unfortunately, the players never really took to it, outside of the diehards. Active players quickly tapered off following the early access launch, with only small spikes thanks to notable updates. But even that seems to have stopped. This month, a big PvP update went live , and it didn't move the needle at all. Since early July, it's been stuck under 1,000 concurrents, and this month it's been averaging around 300.

(Image credit: Hexecutable) It's shocking how many parallels I was able to draw between Jenny's experience and my own, both growing up and even now well into my adulthood. The self-deprecation, the ever-piling goals for what is ultimately an unattainable lifestyle, the not-too-subtle comments from family members. Accidentally making dieting your entire personality.

The headset looks a lot like the $325 Arctis Nova Pro —from the swooped back earcups and placement of the ANC and boom arms, to the desktop hub included with both sets. SteelSeries says it teamed up with a designer here, Jakob Wagner, but the external differences appear to be mostly material. Literally—the Elite has a little more metal, including the control wheel on the side, which might explain the added weight. The Elite weighs 380 grams. The Pro, 338 grams. But under the hood, there are some changes. The Elite's drivers are touted as carbon fibre. Rated to the same frequency response as the Pro's 40 mm drivers, 10 - 40,000 Hz, the carbon fibre cans are more sensitive with a dBSPL of 101 to the Pro's 98.

You could be exploring a vault or listening to a quest—like, perhaps, the Timekeeper invading your friends' brains and threatening you —and your shield will randomly pipe up to put you in your place.

So, why did The Serial port then strap 12 dial up modems together, specifically ? To utilise Multilink PPP and attempt to stream YouTube over multiple 56 Kbps internet connections. After a little bit of maths, the creators worked out that they'd need at least a 182,286 bits per second connection to watch one of their own recent uploads at 240p resolution (YouTube's lowest video quality on desktop) without buffering.

All Skills are skills, but only some are Action Skills. Same as all Guns are Guns, but only some are Shotguns.\" Simple, then. Thurston then explains that Skill Damage impacts basically everything involving the word \"Skill\", including passive skills and traits and, you guessed it, Action Skills.

Despite executive producer Tom Cannon saying in July that \"our goal is to keep the game up, online, and available\" from the closed beta's launch, it seems that Riot needs just a few days to get everything straightened out. A post on the 2XKO X account reads: \"We need a little more time to get early access up and running, so we'll be shutting down closed beta a few days early on Oct 3 @ 9pm PT.\" Servers will be back up and running in time for the early access launch on October 7 at 8am PT/11am ET/4pm BST. Riot says that offline mode will still work, so players should still be able to hit the lab, play local multiplayer, and face off against CPUs. Three-and-a-half days to do some tinkering behind the scenes is nothing in the grand scheme of things, especially when I think about other fighting games who took their betas offline and straight-up vanished for a year— looking at you, Multiversus. The downtime news was released alongside a trailer for 2XKO's tenth champion, verifiable League mascot Teemo. And as someone who doesn't play the MOBA, I finally understand …",

Campaign 4 will also be a \"West Marches\" style game with 13 entire players split over three groups. It's an incredible undertaking I have absolute faith he can pull off , but also, is he okay? I get bent out of shape trying to run a bi-weekly Pathfinder 2e game while maintaining a full-time job, and that's just for my friends, not the entire internet. Turns out: Yes, yes he is. In a recent interview with Wargamer , Mulligan was quick to dismiss the idea that this workload was anything other than his personal heaven: \"It's funny, because I've had multiple people check in on me because of the Herculean epicness of this undertaking. I get more people than I would frankly like being like, 'Are you okay, man?'\" Oops.

And the market just might have something to react to with this story: a woman has been arrested by London's Met Police for stolen bitcoin valued at—gulp—$6.7 billion or thereabouts. The woman, Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, also allegedly known as \"the goddess of wealth\" by some, plead guilty to two counts in Southwark Crown Court, related to the acquisition and possession of criminal property (via BBC News ). The assets in question: 61,000 bitcoin. 61,000 x 113,000 = 6.893 billion dollars. The value has shifted a little since the Met made its calculations, but that's bitcoin for you. Six months ago a single bitcoin was worth less than $100,000. Six years ago it was around $3,000. Qian is said to have received the bitcoin from large-scale fraud in China, with over 128,000 victims pouring their cash into Qian's investments. Qian then stored the stolen assets in bitcoin, which has had a pretty good year. Qian is then said to have moved to the UK and attempted to launder the assets by purchasing property with assistance from a…",

As the crack team at PCG towers discussed the deal, one line stuck with me: \"I wouldn't want to be sitting in a BioWare chair right now.\" The vibes around one of the all-time great RPG studios have not been good in recent years, and the fairly decent Dragon Age: The Veilguard didn't persuade anyone that the studio is capable of surpassing contemporary greats like Baldur's Gate 3 or Disco Elysium.

      "body": "PC Gamer retro-gaming aficionado Rich Stanton was seriously impressed with Terminator 2D: No Fate when it was revealed earlier this year, saying it \"looks like the best Terminator game since the Genesis.\" And for the record, no, he wasn't kidding . It's bad news for Rich, then, that he's going to have to wait a little longer than expected before he can start playing. Publisher Reef Entertainment announced today that the planned October 31 release date has been bumped to November 26 , for a pretty simple reason: Global financial instability. \"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector's Editions,\" the publisher wrote. \"Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.\" The Terminator 2D: No Fate Collector's Edition is a pretty swanky package, with a Steelbook case and collector's tin, art book, flipbook, a \"premium metal paperweight,\" two cloth posters, a fake arcade token, and more. It's the kind of thing that makes big box collectors think, yes, I would spend $100 on that. Alas, a PC edition of the CE is not…",

      "body": "Grand Theft Auto 6 won't just be the biggest game of 2026: it's the first series entry since the departure of several Rockstar big-hitters who've been involved almost from the start. Things didn't go so well for longtime GTA producer Leslie Benzies, whose studio Build A Rocket Boy released MindsEye earlier this year. That was a bit of a disaster, to the extent the developer immediately went through a round of layoffs . Another departure was Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar who left in 2020 to establish Absurd Ventures, which is so far living up to the name by releasing a graphic novel, an audio drama, a novel, and recently announcing the Absurdaverse . Before leaving Rockstar, Houser was a lead writer on every GTA game since GTA London 1969 (released in 1999), and with GTA5 first releasing in 2013 it's not unreasonable to think he may have had some involvement there. Not so. In a new interview with IGN Houser says he had no involvement with GTA 6: \"They're always a new story. It's not going to be a story I wrote or a character set that I developed, but I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure.\" Houser's asked if it'll be a bit weird playing a new GTA…",
