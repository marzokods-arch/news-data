And then inevitably, there&#8217;s discussion to which bands have yet to get in, and which are the most overlooked and which seem destined to forever be on the outside. And then finally: Which previously ineligible bands will soon be up for voting for the first time — and do any of them have a real chance of getting in? With this year&#8217;s Rock Hall induction finally coming up this weekend (Nov. 9), we think it&#8217;s a good time to look back on rock&#8217;s history — from the very beginning up until this century — and figure out which rock bands we at Billboard think still serve as the benchmarks for greatness. Which of the established canon of rock greats do we still think still merit their spots in the genre&#8217;s inner circle? Which newer artists do we think belong in there with them? Which artists from regrettably of…",

The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

The latest report aligns with an earlier leak suggesting a February 25, 2026, event in San Francisco. Frequent changes to product plans for the Galaxy S26 Edge and Galaxy S26 Plus have delayed Samsung’s design and production timeline. It would be a slight understatement to say that Samsung’s plans for its upcoming flagships are all over the place. We first heard that the Galaxy S26 launch is reportedly set for February 2026 in San Francisco. A subsequent leak disagreed with this timeline, stating that the company had managed to pull itself together and is now gunning for a late January launch . Now, a new report is reverting to the February launch timeline, and everyone is confused about which leak to believe now. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It’s believed Samsung could reduce the phone’s thickness and weight by over 10%. This comes after the Galaxy Z Fold 7 received a radical redesign. Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7 earlier this year, and it has an ultra-thin and light form factor following years of iterative designs. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also delivered a thin form factor, but Samsung might go the extra mile with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. The Bell (h/t: Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that Samsung wants to make the Galaxy Z Flip 8 much thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. More specifically, the company is apparently aiming to reduce the Z Flip 8’s thickness and weight by more than 10%. This suggests that the upcoming Flip phone could be ~12mm thick when folded and weigh ~169 grams. However, the outlet added that it cannot rule out a further reduction in weight and thickness.",

Both corporations are projected to lose millions of dollars. Google is reportedly demanding a “special price,” lower than that of three bigger distributors. Disney, although hesitant, might have to oblige to reduce its losses and restore investors’ confidence ahead of its earnings call tomorrow. Over the past couple of weeks, Google and Disney have been at loggerheads due to a pricing dispute. What started with both parties’ failure to meet each other halfway in negotiations, resulting in more than 20 Disney channels, including ABC and ESPN, being removed from YouTube TV , has spread to other streaming platforms and blocked access to Disney’s paid content across other Google-owned platforms . The conflict is costing both parties. YouTube has been forced to issue refunds to customers for the unavailability of Disney-owned channels on YouTube TV and prevent them from cancelling subscriptions. With its subscriber count estimated to be over 9 million in the US, that’s a cumulative loss of nearly $200 million for the tech giant. The los…",

Google Maps is a mostly reliable and robust mapping application on Android, but its problems become apparent when used through Android Auto.

The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will reportedly feature Exynos or Snapdragon chips, depending on the market. The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will reportedly get Snapdragon power in North America, while Europe and Korea receive the Exynos versions. The Samsung Galaxy S26 series is expected to be powered by Snapdragon or Exynos processors. But which model will you be getting in your country? Well, a Korean news outlet has revealed some details. ET News reports that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset globally. This isn’t exactly a surprise, as we recently heard that there wouldn’t be an Exynos version of the Ultra phone.",

Citron is effectively a fork of the shuttered Yuzu Nintendo Switch emulator, and it received a major update earlier this year. Now, the Citron team has released another update, and there’s good news if you have a Snapdragon 8 Elite phone. The Citron team announced the availability of the v0.11.0 update this week, and the headline addition might be Snapdragon 8 Elite GPU support. The changelog specifically points to optimizations for the 8 Elite GPU, improved shader execution and compilation on Adreno GPUs in general, and an “optimized rendering pipeline” for high-end Android devices.

      "body": "TL;DR Google Maps is introducing a new Power Saving Mode, but the feature is exclusive to the Google Pixel 10 series. The mode displays a simplified, black-and-white layout on the Always-On Display to reduce power consumption. This can extend battery life by up to four hours by leveraging the AOD’s ultra-low-power display state. Update: November 12, 2025 (12:07 AM ET): We noted in our original article that the new Power Saving Mode in Google Maps might work for walking or using two-wheeler directions. However, Google’s support page now makes it clear that the feature is only available in driving mode and doesn’t support other travel modes, such as walking or biking navigation. Once you start navigating, you can view a power-saving version of the navigation map right on your lock screen by pressing your phone’s power button. To exit this mode, simply tap the screen or press the power button again. If you want to return to the power-saving navigation view, just press the power button once more.",

While it’s more affordable than last year’s Cine Play 1, it’s still firmly in premium territory, starting at roughly US $1,670 for the base model or around US $1,950 with the optional stand bundle. The Cine Play 1 Plus delivers 3,500 lumens of brightness and claims 110% coverage of the BT.2020 color gamut, promising highly vivid colors. Its RGB laser light source is rated for approximately 25,000 hours, and the projector supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ for dynamic range playback.

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

YouTube TV and Disney are now solidly into week two of failing to work out a new coverage deal, with the consequence that the latter’s channel properties have gone dark on the former’s streaming service. The fallout’s been spreading to other streaming solutions, too, and although subscribers have been offered a $20 credit , what they really want are their channels back. As we wait to see if some compromise can be made, we’re getting a little new insight into what could be the core sticking point that’s in the way of an easy solution.

As opposed to other pass types — store loyalty cards or concert tickets, for example — private passes come with extra security features meant to help keep critical information attached to documents like government IDs or health insurance cards private. One of those security features is that private passes can only exist on a single device at one time, but it looks like that could be changing. Experimenting with the latest version of Google Play services, we spotted code that indicates Google Wallet might soon incorporate features that will allow users to transfer private passes between devices, or even sync them between multiple concurrent devices.",

      "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm is rumored to have added Android 16 support for its Snapdragon X PC chips. While it sparks hopes about Android-based PCs, there’s not enough evidence or clarity yet. One of the biggest roadblocks is the absence of proper software support, as Android still lacks a fully functional desktop mode. Google’s Chrome OS has aged better than most PC users would have anticipated, but its long run is nearing its end. Google has already confirmed its plans to merge Chrome OS with Android , and the driver behind this shift is the need to manage engineering resources more effectively and compete with Apple . While this is expected to be a multi-year transition, we may see actual laptops — not flagship tablets capable of serving as laptop replacements — running Android soon. Tech analyst known as @Jukanlosreve on X recently shared a rumor about Qualcomm testing Android 16 for its Snapdragon X series chips. What makes the development interesting is that while the Snapdragon X, X Plus, and X Elite chipsets feature an Arm64 architecture, similar to those found in phone chips, Qualcomm specifically designates them for thin and light laptops. In simpler terms, Android 16 may be being t…",

This is a Linux-based mobile platform that features BlackBerry 10-inspired features like Active Frames and a Hub inbox. Marathon OS currently runs on the OnePlus 6, with plans to bring it to the OnePlus 6T, POCO F1, and more. BlackBerry 10 may have been a failed rival to Android and iOS, but it was an intriguing and innovative mobile platform in its own right. Now, an enterprising developer has decided to build a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10, and it’ll run on Android phones . Developer Patrick Quinn has announced development of the Marathon OS project , which he claims will be a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10. Quinn says the platform will include BB10 staples such as the familiar gesture navigation system, a take on the BlackBerry Hub for a unified messaging/notification inbox, and the Active Frames concept. When it comes to the latter, BlackBerry 10 had a home screen that showed currently running apps as card-based windows, and these windows were still able to refresh in real-time. Marathon OS even features the BB10 peek gesture, which …",

Usually, I know how things are going to go: Apple will put up a pretty good fight with solid cameras and excellent optimization, only to come up short in terms of the overall experience. This year, however, I feel like there has been less change from one generation of Android flagship to the next from the two most prominent players in the US. The Galaxy S25 line barely needed to exist, and the Pixel 10 series is the best phone Google has ever made, but it’s not life-changing — it’s still a Pixel, just better.
