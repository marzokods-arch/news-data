      "body": "طالب واين روني، نجم مانشستر يونايتد السابق، آرني سلوت، مدرب ليفربول، باستبعاد النجم المصري محمد صلاح من التشكيلة الأساسية، في محاولة لإعادة الفريق إلى الانتصارات. وجاءت تصريحات روني بعد خسارة ليفربول الثقيلة بنتيجة 3-0 على أرضه أمام نوتنجهام فورست يوم السبت، والتي جعلت حامل اللقب الحالي يتراجع إلى المركز الحادي عشر في جدول ترتيب الدوري الإنجليزي الممتاز، بفارق 11 نقطة عن المتصدر آرسنال. ولم يتمكن صلاح من تسجيل أي هدف أو تقديم أي تمريرة حاسمة خلال المباراة، والتي شكلت الهزيمة السادسة لليفربول في آخر سبع مواجهات بالدوري الإنجليزي الممتاز. وبعد خسارته أمام مانشستر سيتي في الجولة السابقة، استقبل الفريق 6 أهداف دون رد في آخر مباراتين بالدوري. وقال روني، عبر برنامجه \"The Wayne Rooney Show\": \"صلاح لا يساعد الفريق على المستوى الدفاعي. أنا متأكد أنه إذا كنت أحد اللاعبين الذين تم التعاقد معهم ورأيت زملاءك لا يجتهدون في العودة للوراء، فماذا سيكون شعورك؟ أعلم أنه أسطورة النادي وكل ما قدمه للفريق، لكن إذا كنت جالساً على دكة البدلاء، فما الرسالة التي يرسلها لك إذا رأيت أحد اللاعبين لا يجري خلف الكرة وهو يشارك في كل مباراة؟\". وأضاف: \"لو كنت مكان سلووت كنت سأقدم على قرار كبير ليترك أثرًا على بقية الفريق.. عندما لا تفوز بالمباريات، عليك أن تحافظ على الانضباط وتكون صعب الإيقاف\". وتابع: \"أعتقد أنهم …",
