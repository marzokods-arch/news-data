You and your people have hidden in the maintenance tunnels, but now the monstrosity is colonizing them too, so you've got to go into the biomes and build yourselves sustainable communities from the wreckage there—a landscape now populated by weird mutants that the Scale left in its wake.

It's easy to dismiss videogame recipe books as a frivolous marketing gimmick, and I'm as guilty of this as anyone else. My original plan for this article was to find the most preposterous example of a gaming-themed cookbook, then attempt to recreate the silliest recipe from it. I assumed this would be easy. I mean, nobody could actually write a good Sonic-themed cookbook, could they? Yet when I looked into this odd corner of gaming culture, I noticed two things.

That's a wild number for any shooter, especially given that the game only released a little over a week ago. It even briefly overtook Battlefield 6 , one of the biggest games on Steam in general right now , with BF6 settling in at around 318,000 players around midnight UTC Saturday morning and Arc Raiders sneaking past it with over 329,000. Arc Raiders can't match the long-running shooter's soaring highs, but it's drawn in a huge and consistent audience in its first week.

This week I've been: continuing to team up with players in Arc Raiders, and blasting the mean ones. As much as I love the nail-biting tension of extraction shooters, it's long been a genre obsessed with a rigorous gear grind and slow pace that make it almost impenetrable for new players, or those that can't dedicate more than a few hours a day or even a week. The one exception to this until now has been Hunt: Showdown , and while I can't recommend it enough, let's face it, it's not your typical extraction shooter. So, for all these years, the extraction shooter has remained the dominion of a select few with enough time and patience to dedicate to it—and invariably trounce anyone who dares to give it a casual go. Of course, with enough time and determination, you'll eventually join that elite band, but my point is that the genre isn't known for being welcoming and even semi-casual. If you want a genre to truly grow and experiment, encouraging a more diverse audience will do it. Just as I thought perhaps the genre would never become truly …",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. If you're reading this website, you almost certainly use Steam. In fact, I'll go one further: you probably use it a lot . Valve's little app is the load-bearing wall of PC gaming at this point. But when something becomes that ubiquitous, it's easy to take it for granted—and to simply stop thinking about it. How much do you really know about this program that you let control most of your gaming life? It's time to find out—and perhaps learn a fact or two along the way—with our latest quiz. We've plumbed the depths of the entire history of Steam, from its humble beginnings to its industry-defining present, and fished up a bounty of trivia to test you. Let us know how you did in the comments!",

Sure, Helldivers 2 deserves its success, but Extermination's developer, Offworld, must be a little green watching Arrowhead's bug-blasting, fascist lampooning sci-fi action game gallivant off with all of the money. Hence, it would only be fair for Offworld to copy Arrowhead's homework a little, which appears to be the case for the cooperative spinoff's latest update. Update 1.8 will primarily introduce a Company progression system to Extermination when it arrives later in November. But I'm more intrigued by its tertiary feature—in-game airstrikes. Now, these work a little differently from Helldivers 2's airstrikes. Where Arrowhead's game lets you deploy them as a Stratagem, they form a side-mission in Extermination, something you can take on alongside the primary objective of building/defending your base. Specifically, players must defend new objectives called Fleet Relays out in the field, successfully doing which…",

But developer Tomas Sala wasn't satisfied with the end product, and has spent the last year or so overhauling the game in his spare time from supporting his other game— Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles . The result released this week, a free update that, according to Sala, reworks \"literally everything\" about the game. Certainly, the changes are extensive. The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster provides a complete visual overhaul of the game, not only improving the lighting, visual effects, animations etc, but also reworking the world itself. Many of its cities and key locations have been remade, while others have been expanded to look grander and more impressive. The comparison shot below gives you some idea of the differences (Image credit: Tomas Sala) The remaster also alters many of the Falconeer's key mechanics.

Back in 2006, Microsoft released a seemingly innocuous device called the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000.

Unlike the Gulp Frogs incident in Mists of Pandaria Remix, this farm seems relatively less broken, but it still can net you millions of infinite power, which is used to level up your weapon and increase your character's overall strength. It's been two days since players began capitalizing on it and Blizzard hasn't made any move to kill it. The exploit does, however, cause serious lag from the volume of enemies pouring in if you happen to be nearby, which might be enough for it to land on Blizzard's nerf radar. For now, players are grouping up to slay as many demons as they can before the valve gets shut off. The Sentinax farm, as it's being referred to, is pretty straightforward. In the Broken Shore area there's an event full of demons that drop items you can use to spawn more demons. The trick is to join a group so you can keep a constant supply of them flowing in.

The good news is that one UK team reckons it's cracked the problem, and it's already made the tools for game devs. Human vision has a horizontal field of view of around 200 degrees or so, but the vast majority of 3D games stick with 75 to 90 degrees. Many will let you play around with an FOV (field of view) setting, but once you go over 100, the edges go all kinds of wonky. It is possible, of course, to code a game so that it doesn't do this, but it's easier said than done. That's because while it's a piece of cake to increase the horizontal size of the frustrum created by the camera in a 3D world, objects at the edge of the FOV will look distorted and stretched unless this is all accounted for and corrected. And what might work fine at 110 degrees, for a game that's normally 90 degrees, might not work very well at higher FOV values. Enter stage left, Fovo Techno…",

But why keep giving dates with so much confidence when they know it needs more time to polish?\" (Image credit: Rockstar) But among fans trying to rationalise another delay, there are others within the gaming industry sharing support , thinly-veiled threats , and even some theories about the breaking GTA 6 news. \"Interestingly, just a little industry knowledge for all you gamers, a Nov 19 launch puts them outside the nomination window for most game awards in 2026,\" Palworld's communications director, Bucky, says in a social media post . \"Intentional or…? Either way, expect to see many games (especially AAA ones) swerve to avoid the 2027 awards season.\" Interestingly, just a littl…",

Arc's relatively peaceful game world (not counting all the damn robots) has thus come as a genuinely pleasant surprise, and instead of getting mad and going back to Find My Frogs after an hour or two, I'm thoroughly hooked. I had just one problem: The sound in Arc Raiders would persistently hiccup and hitch, and the troubles would get worse the longer I played. After three or four matches, the audio would drop out for a full second or two, intermittently but repeatedly, multiple times per minute. The game continued to run normally, to be clear, it was just dead silent. The effect was incredibly distracting and irritating, and for a game as dependent on audio cues as Arc Raiders, it was a deal breaker: I was ready to quit playing if I couldn't find a fix. Fortunately, I did find a fix. A search through the Steam forums revealed that I was far from alone in struggling with this issue, which made me feel slightly better about things—misery and company, and all that. The real relief, though, came from Steam user awsk, who shared a fix …",

      "body": "Surviving Mars: Relaunched is an unusual remaster, though this is not particularly clear at a glance. Remasters tend to fall into two categories: gussied up classics that take advantage of technological improvements, new consoles and a new audience, or cynical attempts at double dipping. Surviving Mars comfortably slots into the first group, but given the original's relative youth, you could be forgiven for assuming it's part of the latter. Haemimont Games and Paradox Interactive released the original Surviving Mars back in 2018. In my Surviving Mars review , I said it was \"a lot of hard work, but managing a burgeoning colony never stops being compelling\", and then slapped an 80% on it. Thanks to the DLC, we were then able to keep expanding our colonies with new features all the way up to 2022. (Image credit: Paradox) This is not an ageing classic, then. Nor has its relevance diminished. Survival city builders are even more popular than they were when Surviving Mars first launched, and the fantasy of colonising Mars is as zeitgeisty as ever. It largely feels as fresh as it did back in 2018. Yes, it launched during a previous console generation, but it's compatible with PS5 and Xbo…",

But I still consider myself a fan of the Mafia series and, indeed, of Hangar 13 as a studio—it proved it can put out a game I love with Mafia 3 (and an idea I love with Rhapsody , its sadly canned post-Mafia-3 project), and I want to see more from both. So, regardless of my cold feelings toward the game, I'm glad to hear The Old Country did well enough to appease Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K's parent company, Take-Two. Zelnick told The Game Business that Mafia: The Old Country's sales had surpassed Take-Two's internal expectations—though he didn't say what those expectations were—and that \"What we suspected was confirmed.\" What did Zelnick and company suspect? \"If you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.\" Which sounds to me like Take-Tw…",

The main buttons feel different, too, as they're now nestled inside a semi-translucent coating that strikes as one of the more bizarre additions I could think of adding to a mouse redesign. It's like they're trapped in some sort of see-thru amber, which means if you hold the mouse up to the light, you can see through the tips.

Well, they did more than just try ; they actually succeeded. In a post on Reddit , user Retrotom explains the steps they followed to get Nvidia's DGX Spark to natively run Cyberpunk 2077. The little 'AI-supercomputer-in-a-box' sports a GB10 APU, which has a 20-core Arm CPU and a Blackwell-based GPU with 6,144 shader cores. Cyberpunk 2077 runs on DGX Spark from r/nvidia The latter is, to all intents and purposes, the same GPU that's in a GeForce RTX 5070 . Same number of shaders, TMUs, ROPs, ray tracing units, tensor cores, and L2 cache. Where they differ is in VRAM and power. While the GB10 sports 128 GB of LPDDR5x unified memory across a 256-bit wide memory bus for 273 GB/s of bandwidth, the GB205 in the RTX 5070 is home to 12 GB of GDDR7. AI models need lots of RAM, which is why the DGX Spark is so heavily loaded compared to the graphics card, but as the RTX 5070 is for gaming, it us…",

This week, Collins Dictionary posted a blog celebrating and explaining its choice for the Word of the Year (via The Register ). Vibe coding is relatively contentious in itself. Generative AI has been widely criticised for flagrantly ignoring copyright and for its adoption by investors declaring it's the next big thing in games, movies, or whatever art form you hold dear. And that's because there are productivity gains to be made in skipping through all the manual work of creative labour. Of course, that comes with its own set of problems. An overreliance on the black box that is generative AI can make coders less able to actually fix their own problems when they inevitably pop up.

Once you've found the cache, simply interact with it to investigate and sabotage it to complete the Market Correction quest. You don't need to extract with an item or anything like that, so don't worry about escaping alive. Given how quiet Marano Statio…",

Well, a somewhat reliable. More on that in a moment. Its sales, which were reported to be very solid in the US , haven't quite panned out to the rest of the world. At least, if Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick's to be believed in an interview with The Game Business . It's not all doom and gloom, though: \"The critical acclaim [for Borderlands 4] was superb, and we’re really happy with the release. \"Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. So, in terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were a little softer than we would have liked. In the fullness of time, we think it’s going to do great.\" That's only so surprising to hear. Despite the fact Borderlands 4 glued me to it for dozens of hours, I found myself wrestling with constant performance hitches and some truly atrocious UI design.

In the case of the latter, these can be nothing more than a statement of the blindingly obvious, but occasionally, something gets dropped that's just wild . The recent claim that Nvidia will cancel its forthcoming GeForce RTX 50 Super series due to memory shortages is a prime example.

Oh, and the current cards will get a lot more expensive for good measure, too. [rumor]due to the crazy shortage recently, 3gb gddr7 cant make it to the consumer market for desktop, thus the super series is cancelled.and the current models are expected to be more expensive very soon, because of the increasing cost of 2gb gddr7. pic.twitter.com/yMSMj1MjqJ November 7, 2025 There's little point in asking Nvidia directly about this because it will always just say things …",
