It's very sharp and stylish, and Mielgo wants you (as in, everyone ) to know that it was not made using generative AI. \"I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI. HELLO,\" Mielgo wrote on Instagram (via Kotaku ). \"Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with [a] huge team—155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.\" I don't know where the AI allegations are coming from, to be honest: There's nothing in the comments on YouTube (or at least nothing that isn't buried so deeply as to be irrelevant), nor have I run across anything on Reddit.

Gus Owen, creator of web game TimeGuessr (it's like GeoGuessr, but you're guessing both the location and year a photo was taken), had an idea: Make a Downdetector for Downdetector. Downdetector's Downdetector , as Owen called it, tells you whether or not Downdetector is down.

The art style and scenery and even the color palate of the games we play eventually get burned into our brains. But how about if I snipped a letter out of a game's stylized title? Think you could identify them, too? If I showed you just an X or a B or a Q, could you tell me what game title it was from? That's today's quiz, and we're going through the entire alphabet, A-Z. I'll show you 26 letters I painstaking cut out of game logos, and you type in the game name. (Feel free to use hints if you get stuck.)

Most players run into a quest early on where you need to heal a goose, but failing it causes the goose to transform into a demon known as Maniacal Goose. Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into. But there's an achievement involved for killing it and we all know that's gamer kryptonite. As players of the new game wrestled with the demon goose and the other geese you can find hanging out in the open world, a strategy formed: throw them into the water and let nature take care of it.

It's something of a drag, to be honest—a lot of he said/she said—but one interestingly odd bit did emerge from the smoke. Krafton CEO Changham Kim reportedly asked ChatGPT to help him figure out how to avoid paying the Subnautica 2 earnout he'd agreed to when acquiring Unknown Worlds. When asked yesterday whether that claim was accurate, Krafton denied it and described the allegation as a \"distraction from [the former Unknown Worlds heads] own efforts to destroy evidence.\" Court transcripts released today reveal something of a different story, however. \"I started discussing this matter with various teams within the company to find—to figure out what we could do,\" Kim testified in his deposition (via translator) when asked what he did when he discovered that Subnautica designer and director Charlie Cleveland and Unknown Worlds co-founder Max McGuire weren't directly in…",

After taking over development duties from original indie developer Hopoo Games last year, Gearbox stepped in it pretty hard , releasing DLC so bad that it broke the game even for players who hadn't purchased it. The fact that it cost $15 didn't help, and most players at the time were mourning Hopoo's exit and what they saw as a naked attempt to cash in. Things are going a bit better this time. While also costing $15—nearly two-thirds the price of the base game— Alloyed Collective adds a whole lot to the game, including two new characters, seven stages with new music tracks, and a new final boss. More importantly, it doesn't seem to be breaking fundamental game systems like physics and how damage is calculated. The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, at least among folks who've bought the DLC. The Risk of Rain 2 Steam forums have not been so generous, with reactions like \"Gearbox slop\" and complaints that the DLC isn't free all over the place.

That big, beautiful ape has graced decades of treasured art—art like Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie, which just received a fan patch to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its 2005 launch. The 2000s were a time of social, political, and cultural transfiguration: The global paradigm was reeling beneath the impact of 9/11 and the United States' ensuing War on Terror, the internet was ascending as the universal medium of informational and commercial exchange, and everywhere people wondered: How would director Peter Jackson follow his success with the landmark Lord of the Rings trilogy?

When the pandemic initially sent entire corporate industries home, there was a flurry of experimentation in using games not just as hangout spaces, but online meeting rooms too. Some people even had meetings in Red Dead Online. That energy for makeshift avatar office culture didn't really last, and I've felt a lingering loneliness in working from home even though I prefer it to a commute. Trends like body-doubling haven't caught my interest, but what has grabbed me by the throat and not let go is an adorable \"cozy multiplayer productivity game\" called On-Together that's made my work week 100% more social and more productive. Imagine turning Animal Crossing into a coworking space—that's basically On-Together. It's unabashedly cozy game-core with chibi avatars, a pastel color palette, and little minigames like fishing and basketball.

Yet, here we are. The film, as reported by Deadline , is being developed by Anton, the production group behind the 2020 film Greenland , and writers Cory Todd Hughes and Adrian Speckert. Hughes and Speckert don't have any screenplays about being chained together a la Chained Together on their resumes yet, but they have worked on another videogame adaptation: the upcoming Finding Frankie film, the source material for which looks to be one of those not-quite-Five Nights at Freddy's-type games littered about Steam. It's an odd choice for an adaptation. Chained Together doesn't strike me as a narratively inclined game, but then again, neither do Minecraft , Outrun , or Rampage .

Omelet You Cook launched to rave reviews from players, and over the past five months it's achieved one of the rarest of Steam milestones: 100% positive reviews. Over 500 reviews, not a single one of them negative. That is until this week, when one cook spoiled the broth with a red thumbs-down among the sea of blue approval. The lone negative review for Omelet You Cook isn't actually negative, though. \"Game is amazing,\" writes the reviewer. \"I just like to be different.\" Look, I've seen plenty of joke negative reviews on Steam before, often along the lines of \"Why are you searching for negative reviews? Just go play the game, it's great!\" But it's especially bold to post a negative review that breaks that lovely 100% positive streak that's been rolling along for months—just for a joke.

The feature is now live, though voluntary, with the requirement for either \"Facial Age Estimation\" or ID verification becoming mandatory worldwide from December 2025 to January 2026. Users who do not wish to use chat features do not have to complete an age check. \"Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become Trusted Connections with people they know,\" says the Roblox announcement .

My favourite weapon so far, though, has to be the Stitcher; it's a breeze to use against other players. Until now, it's largely been a 'vibe' thing for me. Simply put, I like the way the Stitcher, Ferro, and Anvil feel compared to competition like the Kettle, Arpeggio, and Torrente, among others. And that's lucky for me now that I've seen the maths behind it all. Content creator ' Min Max Lab ', who's been doing a bunch of excellent Arc Raiders science experiments lately, has worked out the efficiency of the most common and popular weapons by weighing up their max durability, how much is lost per shot, and how expensive each one is to repair. As cliché as it sounds, the results will surprise you. Firstly, my beloved Stitcher is the most efficient of the bunch, wringing out 13,700 damage/1950 shots per full repair at level 4, which works out to just two credits per shot. This demolishes the Rattler IV's average 11,900 damage per gun at 3.9 credits per shot. There's a noticeab…",

If you're letting players pilot ships, you're kind of obliged to give them somewhere to go in them and something to do in them.

Dailian quotes a Samsung report claiming, \"the 2nm first-generation gate-all-around (GAA) process has improved performance by 5%, power efficiency by 8%, and area by 5% compared to the 3nm second-generation process.\" At first glance, those are not exactly mind blowing advances. For context, it's worth noting that comparing nodes between companies is awfully tricky. Superficially, you might expect Samsung's new 2 nm node, also known as SF2, to be broadly comparable to TSMC's upcoming N2 technology, which has yet to be seen in a chip you can actually buy but is also ostensibly a 2 nm-class node. On paper, you'd also throw Intel's 18A node into the same category. Again, Intel's 18A isn't out yet but is due any day now. In practice, it's way more complicated than that. For instance, the very notion of the implied scale of \"2 nm\" is now quite disconnected from actual feature size inside modern chips.

I like boring, and boring to me is no super exciting new features that will break machines for millions of people around the world.\" \"6.18 does not seem to [have] problems. But we had a rash of test failures, and it turned out they were… actually failures of the tests, not of the kernel,\" Torvalds continued. \"So I was a bit worried a couple of weeks ago, but it seems to be shaping up to be another incremental, and boring in the best possible way, release.\" Certainly, there's a lot to be said for boring.

Now, as we've detailed on multiple occasions , FSR 4 Redstone is AMD's latest AI-enhanced upscaling platform. Broadly speaking, it's an effort to catch up with Nvidia's equivalent DLSS technologies, which have been ahead of AMD's curve when it comes to the use of machine learning in general, along with some specific capabilities that AMD lacks. The headline enhancement is more fully leveraging machine learning for upscaling, which is why, as we understand it and as the new AMD teaser trailer implies, Redstone will be tied to AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT . Only the latest AMD graphics architecture has sufficient hardware matrix math ability to run the AI code. Or so the story likely goes, anyway. Slightly confusingly, AMD has also said that Redstone can run on Nvidia GPUs on account of being developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology can therefore be \"converted\" into compute shader code.…",

Said rodent sits on your shoulder and speaks gnomically in a voice that sounds like someone unrolling an ancient, cursed papyrus scroll, and I already love him and want him to be my very best friend. The rat appears right at the start of the trailer, seemingly complaining to the player character about having narrowly escaped an ambush.

This would essentially overwrite the appearances of those items with the ones you transmogged them to. In Midnight, that's all changing.

Luckily, outside of gift giving and quality time, you can also work on your bond by riding them around and jumping over obstacles, but this process is still pretty arduous. Fortunately, I've found a hidden spot that, with a bit of decorating, can be a vital tool in levelling your horses, and make things feel much more efficient. (Image…",

(Image credit: Furcula) It's not the basic premise that's so confusing, though it is odd: you play a mouse living in the sewers, who must battle his way up through the corrupt society above. The clearest inspiration is The Binding of Isaac, with winding dungeon levels, top-down shooting, and a cute-but-gross art style. The biggest twist is the morsels themselves. Each run you choose a card that allows you to transform into one—a kind of ugly little monster with its own unique attack style and special ability. New cards can be found over the course of the run, and you can hold up to three at a time, so you can shift between forms. But with that framework established, Morsels immediately throws you in at the deep end.

Epic Games has announced plans to team up with probably its greatest rival in game development, Unity, to bring games made using the Unity engine to Fortnite. Epic also says, \"Unity’s enhanced commerce platform\" will come to Unreal Engine. What's more, the collaboration will see Unity bring Unreal Engine support to its platform. To quote the killer excerpt from Epic's announcement: \"Developers will have the ability to publish Unity games into Fortnite, one of the world’s largest gaming ecosystems with more than 500 million registered accounts worldwide, and participate in the Fortnite Creator Economy. Also announced today at Unite, Unity’s Annual Developer Conference, Unity will be bringing Unreal Engine support to their cross-platform commerce platform.\" If you're wondering what led these former mortal enemies to get together in such a sweeping collab', over to Tim Sweeney, Founder and CEO of Epic Games. “Just like the early days of the web, we believe that companies need to work together in order to build the open metaverse in a way that’s interoperable and fair,” he said.

In a press release (via Engadget ), TikTok stated that the app's \"manage topics\" section will be expanded with a new toggle \"in the coming weeks\". This toggle will apparently help \"dial things down\" for people who don't want their feed clogged up with AI slop, though TikTok says the toggle is designed to \"tailor\" the range of videos in a feed \"rather than removing or replacing content in feeds entirely.\" Hence, it sounds like you won't be able to opt out of seeing AI slop completely, only choose to see less of it. This toggle will be joined by a new \"invisible watermarking\" feature for TikTok's own AI-infused editing tools and \"content uploaded with C2PA Content Credentials.\" TikTok already requires users who post \"realistic\" AI generated content to label it appropriately, in part using those C2PA Credentials which embed metadata to…",
