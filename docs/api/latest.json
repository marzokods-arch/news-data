Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor are both on sale on Steam at a steep discount through September 23. Fallen Order is 75% off, bringing it down to just $10, and Survivor is 80% off, taking it down to $14. The deluxe version of Survivor is only 70% off, but that still makes it just $26. Both of these games are a bargain at those prices, especially considering they're among the best games in the Star Wars franchise, at least in my opinion. If you enjoy soulslikes, it's definitely worth giving Fallen Order a try. It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire. While Jedi: Survivor isn't perfect, and had a rocky start at launch, it has a solid story and…",

Yet several times over the last few years, I've heard furtive whispers from various corners of the internet that there is one Postal game which is actually, genuinely good. No, I'm not referring to Postal 2 , which despite inexplicably having the same Steam rating as Half-Life 2 , is a pretty shoddy game.

But the adorable trailer for Neville's upcoming physics platformer has got me wondering whether I'm somehow missing out. Wirm belongs to the same floppy family of games as Bennett Foddy's QWOP and Getting Over It , a 2D adventure about bypassing obstacles in a form ill-suited to navigating rough terrain. Yet where Foddy's games have an emphasis on challenge, Wirm appears to adopt a gentler approach—more about the low-key joys of being a worm than getting your ass kicked as one. Wirm furnishes you with the full powers of a limbless invertebrate. Your peristaltic locomotion allows you to crawl over most obstacles, and those which cannot be overcome may be, er, undercome by digging through surrounding soil. Finally, you'll be able to embrace that most commonly understood annelid ability—flying through space. I'm not joking. The trailer for Wirm mainly depicts said worm travelling t…",

Not that they're good, certainly—they usually aren't, with a handful of begrudging exceptions. Nor that they're particularly faithful to or even respectful of the series we love, most of the time. But we can definitely say that they exist. In other words, they are undeniably a part of this great tapestry we call gaming, and we can't just dismiss them. Hide in ignorance, and you're liable to be ambushed by a new Resident Evil movie at an inopportune time—most embarrassing. (Image credit: Warner Bros. / Mojang) In fact, I think it's time we all brushed up on our knowledge of some of Hollywood's least favoured children, which is why I've put together a quiz covering the full breadth of videogame movies.

A likeable, if unremarkable, series of stealth action games starring an anthropomorphic raccoon, Sly Cooper had its heyday in the PS2 era. It was last seen in 2013 in a game not developed by Sucker Punch. Despite being more than 20 years and two series out from its Sly Cooper days, there are fans who still hope Sucker Punch will return to the game that put the studio on the map. But Ghost of Yotei co-director Nate Fox poured cold water on such optimism, as hardly anybody employed at Sucker Punch would be interested in reviving Sly Cooper. In an interview with MinnMax (via GamesRadar ) Fox was asked by host Ben Hanson what percentage of Sucker Punch devs would be up for making a new Sly Cooper game, to which Fox instantly responded \"ten percent\". Hanson was slightly taken aback, so Fox clarified that \"It's been a l…",

The original game, which released way back in 2011, boiled down the infamous complexity of the genre into a more accessible turn-based strategy, focussing primarily on tactical manoeuvres and managing supply lines rather than any base building or faffing around with economics. The sequel ingeniously expands and elaborates upon this simple premise, resulting in one of the best strategy games you can play today, and you can get it right now for a tactically sound 85% off. Unity of Command 2 is based upon the same ideas as the original, all about defeating enemy armies using clever positioning and thinking ahead. Your units' attack power is governed not just by their equipment or experience, but their locations relative to the landscape and both friendly and enemy units, as well as their connection to your army's supply lines. Indeed, the supply mechanic sits right at the heart of Unity of Command, dictating your units' ability to function. If an enemy captures one of your supply depots, it will inhibit units' ability to attack and, eventually, move at all. Likewise, if you can sneak behind an enemy frontline a…",

Tainted Grail's unusual world and intriguing questlines more than made up for a few rough edges, as Sam Desatoff explained in his Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon review . \"Every NPC has something worthwhile to contribute, and most of them offer side quests that add new wrinkles to the larger story,\" he wrote back in June. \"They can also be surprisingly funny: you'll help a nobleman fake his death to get out of a loveless marriage, uncover the lair of an undead chef chasing the next great meal, assist a woman who accidentally turned her husband into a pig, and more.\" Questline has updated Tainted Grail sporadically since launch. But the latest patch— v1.1 —is by far the biggest yet. Not only does it squash a vast array of bugs nibbling at the RPG's underbelly, but it also adds several major features and a bunch of new locations for players to explore.

The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta. In a recent interview with IGN , console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said changes are coming in the final game. \"We definitely reduced the range and overall reduced the power,\" Nickerson said. \"We found out a lot in open beta that it was obviously very strong, just like players said. Really, players ended up just shooting Doritos. Light environments, dark environments—they were just like, ‘Hey, aim at the Dorito. You're going to hit something at the end of the day.’\" I wish that were hyperbole, but I'd guesstimate that a fourth of my kills in the open beta were enemies I never actually saw.

The studio stands accused of taking a very cool new armor set, which had been intended to be a reward from the returning Iron Banner activity, and instead placing it inside the Eververse Store where it sells for 1,500 Silver per character—$15 in real money. The shambles goes back to September 9, when the Destiny 2 team announced the return of the Iron Banner PvP mode, \"with new weapons to earn and an incredibly cool new set of armor .\" A couple days later, though, Bungie unveiled the new Iron Banner armor and it was in fact \"reprised\" armor , which is to say a reskin of old armor—and not an especially impressive one in the eyes of Destiny 2 fashionistas.

The regular map should return early next week. Every player starts each round with a pair of Iron Man items: one for flying and one for shooting. You'll either get the War Machine's Arsenal—which rains down missiles—paired with the War Machine's Hover Jets, or the Stark Industries energy rifle with the iconic Iron Man flight kit.

To help matters (or make things worse, depending on your point of view), 2K produced a detailed chart of what settings Nvidia GPU owners should use to get the best performance. However, most of this just involved enabling upscaling and frame generation. Borderlands 4 is just plain hard on your hardware. Especially the CPU, it would seem, because the minimum system requirements demand an '8 core (or equivalent)' processor, citing an Intel Core i7 9700 as an example. Yesterday, I tested a very similar chip , the 9700K, in a rig with a Radeon RX 5700 XT and 1080p Low quality, and the CPU was frequently hitting 100% utilisation in the open world (see below). But what if your gaming PC has a processor with fewer cores, a Core i5 or a Ryzen 5 chip, for example? Does that mean you're going to be in trouble?

Towards the end of the mission, after clearing out Rippers, beating the Splashzone boss, and fixing the elevator for Claptrap, you then need to ride the lift. It sounds much easier than it is, though, as the lift will fail and you'll then be sent to get clearance, but you're not given any hints on where to look. Don't shoot the messenger, but the answer is frustratingly simple. How to get elevator clearance in Borderlands 4's Recruitment Drive mission (Image credit: Gearbox) To unlock clearance for the elevator, when facing it, turn around, and you'll see various dead bodies on the ground by the balcony railing. Walk up to any of the bodies and collect the device attached to the back of their neck , which'll glow green during this step. You can then call the lift to bring Claptrap up, at which point he'll unlock the (broken) door to the Abandoned Post safehouse where you can then interact with the data pad to unlock it as a fast-travel point.

Decrepit grognards (me), meanwhile, get misty-eyed thinking about how awesome Fallout 1's pulpy, morally dubious take on the post-apocalypse was. And we will literally never shut the hell up about New Vegas . So colour me surprised that when The Vile Eye asked OG Fallout co-creator Tim Cain about things he'd love to see in one of the games (via GamesRadar ), Cain's answer was unequivocal: \"The one thing I always wished was in a Fallout game was an actual good faction. Like 100% good.\" Cain has a pretty clear idea of what \"100% good\" means, saying that they'd spend their time \"growing food and making shelters and looking for old tech and maybe looking for old medicine, and they're really trying to help people.\" As to why he wants to see this, it's not (just) because he's an old softy, but because he thinks it'd be interesting to see how players approached them.

Because of this, Gearbox made the baffling decision to remove the traditional minimap in favour of a compass at the top of the screen. Sure, the compass is useful for getting your bearings, but it's also completely useless in pinpointing enemies in combat. There's a psycho to your northeast, but they could be standing right in front of you or ten blocks away. See what I mean? Luckily, tucked away at the bottom of the 'gameplay' tab in the settings menu is the radar display .

You may recall that previous Borderlands games on Steam were review-bombed earlier this year because of changes in their EULAs. There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players. It was all a bit (or a lot) overblown, as PC Gamer's Tyler Colp pointed out: \"a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything.\" Those review bombings did indeed have little impact…",

Note: Not long after Borderlands 4 launched on Steam, a 2.7 GB patch appeared. It didn't come with any patch notes, so I have no idea what it fixed or added, but I can say that it stopped most of the crash-to-desktop failures I experienced with my first few runs. Most .

      "body": "This week, the internet is flush with freshly self-appointed legal experts thanks to emerging news that Nintendo has added more patent weaponry to its ever-growing legal arsenal, including a patent on calling and battling companion characters that was seemingly rubber-stamped without pushback by US patent officials. Yesterday, we published the opinions of videogame IP lawyer Kirk Sigmon , who called Nintendo's latest patents \"an embarrassing failure of the US patent system.\" Other legal experts are now echoing Sigmon's skepticism—including the Pokémon Company's own former head lawyer. (Image credit: Nintendo) As is typically the case in videogame patents, the new Nintendo patent generating outcry— US patent 12,403,397 —uses extremely specific language in its claims, which define in rigorous legalese the mechanics of the Let's Go! auto-battle features of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet . But even though those claims would have to be met word-for-word to prove infringement, former Pokemon Company chief legal officer Don McGowan told Eurogamer that he isn't convinced the patent would hold up to scrutiny in a lawsuit due to its similarities to existing art. \"I wish Nintendo and Pokémon goo…",

Chatbots, the FTC said, are designed to mimic human behaviors and \"communicate like a friend or confidant, which may prompt some users, especially children and teens, to trust and form relationships with chatbots.\" Because of that, and—one would assume—the recent uptick in awful outcomes from their use, the agency wants to know what the companies that make chatbots are doing to protect their users. \"Protecting kids online is a top priority for the Trump-Vance FTC, and s…",

Meanwhile, the just-released Hollow Knight: Silksong didn't raise any performance concerns, but gamers in China were dismayed to discover that the Chinese translation was botched. Those are just a couple of the reasons some gamers have chosen to reject launch day hype in favor of \"patient gaming\": Waiting a year or more to play new games, which means getting them cheaper during a sale and playing them after a bunch of big performance and quality-of-life patches have likely made them much better than they were at launch. There's even a pretty active subreddit dedicated to the idea : the main rule is that you're not allowed to post about games that are under a year old. But there's also a reason HBO's servers sometimes struggled with Sunday night demand at the height of Game of Thrones' popularity. There's something special about being there on day one (before they edit out the Starbucks cups ) and reacting and emoting with the crowd. As I write, nearly 200,000 people are playing Borderlands 4 on Steam just hours after it released—on what is for me a Thursday morning. Clearly,…",

It's a different situation over on Steam , however, where a whole lot of people are playing Borderlands 4, but the overall user rating is an ugly \"mostly negative.\" The problem, going by hundreds of user reviews that have already been posted, is almost entirely related to Borderlands 4's performance. Multiple Steam users report low frame rates and persistent stuttering, even at reduced graphical settings and on powerful hardware, and complaints about frequent crashes are also common. \"Terrible, terrible performance. Worst I've ever seen,\" Etikoo wrote in one negative review. \"Turned it down to Low graphics presents and couldn't hit 60 FPS, even with FSR upscaling on my RX 6900 XT.\" \"30fps at native medium to high settings on 1440p with a 3080 TI,\" pirate135246 concurred. \"It also looks worse than BL3 tbh.
