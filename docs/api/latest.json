I know that for many gamers, it delivered the hyperfast bullet ballet they'd always wanted, but for me, it simply felt that far too much of Doom's DNA had been sacrificed in order to deliver it. Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed. A more grounded (literally) take on the classic FPS formula that, to me at least, felt far more like a spiritual successor to the legendary 1993 original. And now, thanks to id Software's 35th anniversary celebrations, Doom: The Dark Ages is over two-thirds off. I definitely rate this FPS, to the point that I'd personally recommend picking it up over Eternal, so I thought I would bring the discount to the wider PC g…",

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules. As the memory supply crisis went further and further into the red, it became clear that a VRAM-stuffed Super refresh in the coming months was unlikely. The RTX 50-series cards we've tested to da…",

With Larian decisively moved on from Dungeons and Dragons and the new series likely featuring a whole new adventuring party anyway, can it rightly be called a Baldur's Gate game? And if it can, can HBO and Mazin be trusted to do it justice? Well, depends who you ask. For instance, if you ask Larian CEO Swen Vincke, the future seems pretty bright, all things considered. In a post on X , Vincke said that \"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures,\" so a series that builds on them makes perfect sense. Even more promising, despite Larian having no official involvement with the series, Mazin and co are apparently in touch with the studio: \"Craig did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us,\" wrote Vincke. \"From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope.\" Hooray! Perhaps the Baldur's Gate show will be… good? Well, here's me dropping the other shoe: at least one Larian honcho is less keen. Publishing lead …",

But it's not all just about emotional character arcs—let's put our main characters' progress into cold, hard numbers, or levels, to be exact. Spoilers ahead for Fallout season 2 At the end of the first season, the levels for each of our main characters were slightly skewed, or at least not where you'd expect them to be. Despite being the main character, Lucy only managed to get to level 8, while The Ghoul sat somewhere around level 89, and Maximus managed to reach level 9. Thaddeus also somehow managed to reach level 50 after accidentally turning himself into a Ghoul (more on that later). So, to wrap up season 2, I've decided to take stock of everything our main characters (plus Norm and Hank) got up to over the course of the eight episodes and see whether they managed to get more or less XP this season. But I'll let you know now, it's not looking good for most of them.

Deadline also reports that the writer and producer has been playing D&D weekly for the past 15 years. Aside from The Last of Us, Mazin is known for HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, as well as a handful of comedy films, including a couple of the Scary Movie parodies and the second two Hangover movies. According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3. The original BioWare RPGs are \"not official source material,\" the site says, but the show can use material from D&D's Forgotten Realms setting in general. It sounds like the plan is to establish a new party of adventurers and then pepper in appearances from Baldur's Gate 3 character…",

Not only is Jakotsu-baba a real pain by himself, but he's also inside the Crucible—basically a nightmare realm, where any damage you take also decreases your maximum health. What's already a hard fight is now a true test of skill, as every hit you take sets you even further back. But don't worry, after banging my head against Jakotsu-baba, I figured out a few things that make this fight easier. How to beat Jakotsu-baba in Nioh 3 Jakotsu-baba is a mandatory boss at the end of the Hamamatsu Castle Crucible, so you need to beat them to continue the story and progress into later zones.

Ki is effectively your stamina, and you'll soon be breathless if you start flailing around as the samurai. So much so that I barely used the warrior early on in favour of the ninja, where I simply overwhelmed the enemy with a flurry of attacks and dodged here, there, and everywhere. The Ki Pulse is how samurai manage their stamina, requiring you to press the right bumper on a controller at the correct time during combos to recover Ki. It's a lot to keep track of, and it doesn't lead to very smooth, impactful samurai combat if you can't do it right. Plus, I'm a sucker for odachis—large, Ki-eating swords—so I was burning through stamina after just a few hits, leaving me defenceless.

Its post-apocalyptic environments are richly imagined, evoking a textured, near-tangible sense of place and passage of time through details that seem intricately considered—except one. As spotted by redditor TNT_Owl , the Spaceport map features an oversight so glaring, so ill-conceived, so obscene that it casts doubt on the entire aesthetic enterprise of Arc Raiders in a way that not even its lifeless AI vendors and barks could. It's an insult. It's an affront. It's—well, it's a stop sign that's positioned kinda funny. This stop sign on spaceport is backwards 🚧 from r/ArcRaiders I'll give you a moment to collect yourself. With a series of MS Paint-annotated screenshots, TNT_Owl presents a damning discovery: West of the Spaceport's Rocket Assembly, there's a stop sign that defies all roadway sensibilities, placed by an intersection in such a way that it's impossible to parse which traffic is meant to observe it. This is a traffic sign that undermines the very notion and purpose of a traffic sign. This, reader, is the antichrist of roadway regulatory symbology. As you might expect, other Arc Raiders players have…",

While the game's other characters summon phantom mounts to ride around on, Ekon is his own mount: He has the ability to shapeshift into a direwolf. Developer Wildlight describes it thusly: While in this form, Ekon’s speed is unmatched by other mounts. Through a full third-person point of view, the direwolf can see around cover. When moving in for an attack, weapons are laid down in favor of Ekon’s deadly bite attack, which will dash forward and bite a prey before immediately transforming back to human form to finish off the job. Attacking without a target will allow Ekon to perform a small air dash to traverse maps more athletically. In addition, while in Wolf Form, Ekon can track an enemy’s scent that they leave in their path. Ekon can use all of his other powers while in Wolf Form.

I say may because I know someone is going to immediately send my dinky ship to the bottom of the sea. Or they'll commandeer it and make me walk the plank. The player-made boats are ugly, hulking blocks of wood and metal sheets that do not look like they should be able to float, but they do. And that's what I love about them. You'll need the usual boat stuff to make one work (steering wheel, anchor, sails, engines, etc), so I'm not sure how long it'll take to hit the open sea's progression point, but I just want reassurance it's a reasonable option for solo players. Even if that means I'll have to face my fears and fistfight a shark. Floating bases offer a lot of the same features you see in land architecture, too.

So, Embark is doing things a little differently for its second Expedition project that departs on March 1. \"Starting off, we want to get one announcement out of the way right off the bat: we’ve heard your feedback about the required Stash value for maximum rewards being too high, and have decided to lower the requirement to three million Coins (600k per Skill Point),\" Embark wrote in blog post published today. \"The reward will still be five skill points for reaching the three million stash value.\" That's a big discount from the five million Coins that were needed to get the full skill point bonuses in the first Expedition—or a million coins per point.

The shooter has a couple animal heroes already: Winston, a super-intelligent gorilla, and Wrecking Ball, a mech piloted by a hamster named Hammond. On the other hand, as Reddit user mikoga points out , those heroes are protected by powerful mechanized armor. Jetpack Cat is 90% just-a-cat. \"I don't want to shoot at a normal ass cat,\" mikoga said. I hadn't really considered it before seeing that comment, but I might also not want to shoot at a normal ass cat, although there are some compelling rebuttals in the thread. Hammond may be protected by a mech suit, notes one commenter, but his little hamster body sometimes spills out of the cockpit when he's eliminated. The mech also explodes a fair bit, as I recall. That does make it hard to claim that Jetpack Cat is an aberration: Overwatch has been annihilating furballs for some time now.

It is, by every measure (well, except that movie ) an unmitigated success.

This interesting spot of trivia came out of a recent Game Business interview with World of Warcraft vice president and executive producer Holly Longdale and game director Ion Hazzikostas (via GamesRadar ), in which Longdale expressed a desire to do more with Warcraft, beginning with broadening its appeal. \"It’s a fantastic IP,\" Longdale sale. \"In my humble opinion, it’s been underutilized and I just want to bring it to as many people as possible.

Fortunately, it all paid off in the end, because now 60+ workers are covered by the new agreement and it offers them a number of significant benefits.

With an included 2.4 GHz wireless receiver and intuitive Bluetooth mode, the G522 Lightspeed can be set up in seconds. It feels comfortable wrapped around the ears. The cushioned pads are spongy and airy, with enough padding, but not so much that you can't hit the frame with your finger with a press. The cups grip just enough to clamp onto the head without adding clamminess in the process. That comfort is enhanced by an adjustable headband sitting just below the plastic shell of the top of the headset. Unfortunately, that band only has two adjustable holes on either side, meaning there are only three adjustment settings total. That does mean if you have a particularly big head , you may find it a little tight. However, for me, I m…",

Burry took to his paid subscriber Substack page to declare that crypto was experiencing a \"collateral death spiral\", thanks to \"sky high leverage\" on crypto exchanges due to rising metal prices, which in turn meant that \"as the crypto collateral fell, the tokenized metals had to be sold\" (via Coindesk ).

But this time, he was told a price couldn't be confirmed and delivery would not be possible until February. Another supplier said they could deliver plates, but at a 40% higher price than before. Thermal Grizzly was paying around 190 euros per plate last year, with each plate enough to make four RTX 5080 GPU water cooling blocks.

Let me just cut to the chase, then: Taking all things into account, the Audeze Maxwell 2 isn't unreservedly better than the first-generation Maxwell. It's improved in some areas, but it's regressed in others (or just not improved), and given that it's a little bit more expensive, it's hard to recommend that you buy the Maxwell 2 instead of the original Maxwell.

But Nioh 3 wasn't only informed by Team Ninja's own work. According to Fujita, Neowiz's Pinocchio soulslike Lies of P was a source of creative inspiration for Nioh 3's boss and combat design. (Image credit: Koei Tecmo Games) When asked how player reactions to Koei Tecmo's recent soulslike and ARPG releases influenced Nioh 3, Fujita said 2023's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty underscored that, while loot is a key part of Nioh's appeal, \"there's a need to control the complexity of the game.\" Likewise, he noted that some players felt the relationship between Wo Long's protagonist and their counterpart in the Blindfolded Boy was underdeveloped, leading Team Ninja to \"go into more depth\" with how co…",

Still, maybe you're a bit yippy, and need extra reassurance—even after a T2 press blast a few days ago—that Rockstar really means it , this time. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick hears your cries. In a recent chat with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Zelnick pointed out that, look, the company must be confident in the November 19 date, because it's spent all this goshdang money on marketing the game in the lead-up time. \"We have marketing beats coming this summer, and we don't spend money on marketing until we're pretty close to release,\" said Zelnick. To be clear, he means more than just putting out a slick trailer in the tail-end of 2023 . Think ads on buses, billboards, a never-ending feast of GTA 6 imagery jammed in your eyes and ears for months on end. It'll be fun! Asked if Take-Two really needs to bother marketing a game that's already bigger than god, Zelnick demurs that \"I think there's a difference between awareness and energy, and we need …",

That tech allows for rapid trigger and adjustable actuation—just like Hall effect does for keyboard, which massively reduces the time between you deciding to click and that on-screen gun firing. Though the Superstrike goes one further with haptic feedback, too. I got my hands on the mouse recently and I'm really impressed . However, it's not a cheap thing. It's set to launch on February 10 for $180 / £160 , which is even a little more expensive than the very expensive Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro , the best gaming mouse currently on the market. And given the Superstrike is aimed at competitive gameplay, I do worry that the advantage it gives might be restricted to only the very few who can afford it. Thankfully, though, while visiting its Swiss labs, Logitech helped somewhat quell my concerns on this front. Of course, the price tag for the Supestrike is what it is, but this is bleeding-edge tech, and it will hopefully become cheaper to implement, or be used in cheaper products in time.

YouTube channel Optimum has been using a 32-inch 4K LG WOLED monitor for around 3,000 hours over two years and has found only minor burn-in. This is a particularly handy metric given that one of the best known existing trackers of OLED burn-in by Monitors Unboxed has been based on a monitor with a Samsung QD-OLED panel . Now we have something similar for LG WOLED. For context, Optimum has been using an LG UltraGear 32GS95UV monitor for a wide range of uses, from gaming to content creation. I think it's a pretty much identical 4K model to the LG UltraGear 32GS95UE I reviewed here , complete with 1080p dual-mode. It's said the panel has been set to between 80% and 100% brightness depending on the time of day. No aggressive measures were taken to alleviate burn-in besides running Windows in dark mode with the taskbar set to autohide. All of the panel protection settings were left in default mode. In practice, that turns out to be just the panel cleaning routine that runs when the monitor is o…",

Logitech's X2 Superstrike is the first serious effort to bring such tech to a gaming mouse, and now that I've had my mitts all over it here at Logitech's Swiss labs, I reckon it stands a chance of shoving the esports scene forwards as Hall effect did with keyboards. The company announced the mouse late last year and since then I've been really excited to try it out, because I'm always on the lookout for something—other than diligent practice—that might improve my Counter-Strike 2 K:D ratio and headshot percentage, as well as my general performance in other shooters. The mouse uses what Logitech is calling a Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS), ie, a mix of haptic feedback and inductive tech for the LMB and RMB switches.

Anecdotally, I can well believe this figure, as YouTube's ad frequency ramped up at such a rate towards the end of 2025 that I finally caved and bought a YouTube Premium subscription myself. Speaking of which, while Alphabet doesn't report YouTube Premium's revenue individually, it has declared that the company now has \"over 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services, led by strong adoption for Google One and YouTube Premium.\" On the surface, YouTube's revenue figure seems impressive—but its viewing figures are even more so.
