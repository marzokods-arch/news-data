But at a certain point, there was a blind writing test because they were looking to expand their writing team, and I contributed.\" Fielder completed the writing test, and then he waited. \"This may be an apocryphal story, but apparently they read over everyone's samples, and they were like, 'OK, bring this person in.' And they looked up who it was, and they were like, 'Well, that'll be easy, it's Joe, he's in the next room.' So I was pulled in to work on that.

SMGs and shotguns may be lethal up close, but you're going to want something with a bit more damage at range to pick up the slack when you're in a long-distance relationship with your enemy.

We spent the better part of this year lamenting ridiculously high GPU prices , and as soon as said prices finally start dropping , memory and storage prices start climbing. You might have noticed this worrying trend if you've been looking for a RAM upgrade lately. Charts on pcpartpicker.com are telling: since mid-2025, DDR4 and DDR5 consumer memory kit prices have been climbing, with particularly notable spikes since September. That's true all the way from DDR4-3200 kits up to DDR5-6000 ones. To take one concrete example, this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 kit on Amazon , which was stable at $95 or less throughout most of the year, but from mid-August onward started climbing. Now, it's up to $184, which makes for a 94% increase. This, after a good few months of sustained DDR5 price drops through the tail end of 2024 and first half of 2025. DDR4 isn't safe, either, as this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4-3600 kit on Amazon shows. It was stable at about $70 through most of the year, but excluding a brief drop back to down to this original price, from mid-August it shot up to a new price of $161. That's a 115…",

Well, I'd argue it's when you need to strap a bunch of external devices to it in order to get the most out of it, which is exactly what's happened to the Strix Halo-powered OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex . It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

Either way, most companies would avoid making much noise about it. Apparently, London-based Gotraka isn't like most companies. One lucky Redditor spied an absurdly good deal on the black midi version of the Fractal Design North PC case . Gotraka normally sells this case for around £155 (about $205), but the poster snapped it up when it was briefly listed for only £20 (a little under $27). Gotraka not only honoured this incredibly low price, but even sent the buyer a note with their order. This read, \"We made a pricing mistake. You made it go viral. So we did what we believe is right—we owned it.\" Gotraka itself has since shared a blog post going into more depth about how the pricing mistake happened.

In very simple terms, that means the Vera Rubin superchip sports 60 times the number of transistors of an Nvidia RTX 5090 gaming GPU . And that is a completely bananas comparison. What's more, the Vera Rubin superchip is capable of 100 petaflops of raw compute. And that is exactly 100 times more compute than Nvidia claims for its neat little DGX Spark AI box . Oh, and it packs 88 custom Arm cores suporting 176 software threads for conventional CPU compute, too. On a side note, that Arm CPU bit (which alone is known as Vera) is interesting from a PC perspective as you might expect its custom designed CPU cores, which notably support multi-threading, could turn up in a PC processor in the future.

I haven't had as long as I'd like with Embark's new extraction shooter, so this review is indeed in progress, with the final version coming sometime in the future when I've had a chance to properly experience it in all of its intersocial beauty. The premise of Arc Raiders is simple: the world has gone to hell thanks to robots and AI, so now all the humans are holed up in small communities underground, with you and other raiders occasionally popping up to the surface to gather resources to trade, create gear, and upgrade your base. On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff.

There are plenty of strong unique weapons you can grab early in the game, whether you want a sneaky knife that gets stronger with every stealth kill, or a sniper rifle that lets you plant explosive bolts on unaware enemies before detonating them. I've included the seven strongest unique weapons you can get in the game's first region, Paradise Island, along with info on how to grab each. These range from pistols, to long arms, to melee weapons, so there should be something that'll fit every build.

In their place is a single, static image informing onlookers that content updates are done. You can compare the page's glow-down yourself. On the Wayback Machine , a version of the New World Steam page from October 7 features 14 screenshots, three trailers, and 'Mostly Positive' recent reviews, plus options to purchase either the game's standard or deluxe edition. It's now all gone. Which is more than a little odd, since Amazon explicitly said yesterday that the MMO would remain available for purchase \"on all platforms until further notice.\" Canny readers may note that Steam is a platform, and that no notice was given that the game was being removed from it.

During yesterday's GTC keynote presentation , Huang explained how it was—who'd a thunk it?!—Nvidia GPUs that would unlock the potential of quantum computing. Huang outlined how the individual bits of quantum computing, known as qubits, are inherently unstable, only surviving for a few hundred operations. But \"solving meaningful problems requires trillions of operations,\" Huang said. \"The answer is quantum error correction. Measuring disturbs a qubit which destroys the information inside it. The trick is to add extra qubits—entangled—so that measuring them gives us enough information to calculate where errors occurred without damaging the qubits we care about.\" In this scenario, hundreds of entangled qubits combine to form a single, error-corrected logical qubit inside a QPU or quantum processing unit.

      "body": "If you've played a battle royale before, chances are you've run into the awkward situation where you've killed all but one member of an enemy squad, but you just can't find the bugger. Either they ran for the hills, or they've got a grudge and are preparing to ambush you for round two. What if I told you there's a way to get around this in the Battlefield 6 battle royale Redsec, if only you show some restraint? It's only explained in a loading screen or in-game tip (if you haven't turned those off) that you can melee downed enemies to perform a shakedown . This will play a short takedown animation that will reveal the positions of any remaining squadmates, whether it's one lone straggler or three of them. It's easy to miss the prompt, so be careful not to do a standard melee swing, as that won't reveal enemies, and you risk outright killing the downed enemy instead. (Image credit: EA) The kicker is they'll be marked on your map, but also via in-world spotting, making it really easy to pin down and track the locations of their angry friends. This ping will only last a few seconds, so make the best use of it you can by either aggressively pushing the enemy or getting into a better p…",

He says the dread phrase that I truly thought we'd heard the last unironic use of at least a full decade ago. \"We haven't even had our Citizen Kane yet, let alone, you know, Jurassic Park or Star Wars.\" It's disturbingly possible that some people reading this might be too young to remember the videogame discourse of the late 2000s, but it was a time when the industry as a whole—and especially a lot of game players themselves—were seized by a kind of paralysing inferiority complex. Were games legitimate , like novels and films were? Were they art? What did we even mean by 'art'?

While most of the interview bounced between incomprehensible AI talk and variations on 'Microsoft's Azure servers make a shitload of money,' when it came to gaming Nadella didn't seem to have much new to say, though what he did say he said with inspiring confidence: \"Most importantly the game business model has to be where we have to invent, maybe, some new interactive media as well. Because after all, gaming's competitio…",

One day is not enough time to confidently declare Blackwell Fields the worst map in Battlefield 6, but that hasn't stopped folks from doing it anyway . I'm enjoying its glorious exploding oil derricks and the way its rolling hills and minimal building cover emphasizes vehicle play, but its major flaw is abundantly clear, because it's the same flaw that's been grinding everybody's gears since Battlefield 6's beta: several of the maps that Battlefield 6 considers \"large\" are actually pretty small. Blackwell Fields isn't big enough. New Sobek City isn't big enough. Siege of Cairo isn't big enough. Iberian Offensive isn't big enough. Empire State isn't big enough. We're beyond coincidence. There's a serious disconnect between what DICE and the rest of Battlefield Studios believe Battlefield maps should look like and what a lot of players obviously want, and I think I've identified an important reason why. Here are the layouts of Blackwell Fields and New Sobek City , two \"large\" Conquest maps that feel cramped. Image 1 of …",

Today, update 1.14 has finally landed—and it brought a bonus Balatro-themed expansion with it. Considering that Vampire Survivors was one of the first games featured in Balatro's first Friends of Jimbo update —a collaboration that both games have followed with more crossovers than I'm willing to count—it's only fitting that Jimbo would return the favor for the update that makes Vampire Survivors more of a communal experience than ever before. Alongside the online co-op mode in which up to four players can roam freely around the map while leveling up together, the Ante Chamber expansion adds Balatro's Jimbo and a trio of rare jokers as playable characters, four similarly Balatro-themed weapons including a burning score counter and a banana barrage, and the titular Ante Chamber stage. To start unlocking Ante Chamber content, you'll need to purchase the Joker Disk relic in the Moongolow stage for 50,000 gold. If you play a lot of Vampire Survivors, you might already have tha…",

The second punch, delivered near the end of the year, was ZSNES, which did the same for much newer Super Nintendo games. And it was fast —even on the modest PCs of the era. \"When I was 16 years old I started learning assembly, and I got so fascinated with optimization, making everything as fast as possible,\" said zsKnight, the developer behind ZSNES, in an interview last week . While most software is written in higher level programming languages like C++ that are easier to work with, even at a young age zsKnight was skilled enough in low level assembly language to start using it to program his own emulator. Back in 1997, computer processors weren't yet fast enough to accurately emulate game consoles.
