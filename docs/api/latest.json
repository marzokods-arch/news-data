Acutis was canonised in an ancient ritual led by Pope Leo, who himself has a good shout to be the first gaming Pope . The teenager's path to sainthood has been remarkably short: the campaign to have him canonised began six years after his death in 2012; he was decreed \"Venerable\" in 2018, \"Blessed\" in 2020, and now the Pope has formally declared Acutis a saint in St Peter's Square in Vatican City. Born in London, Acutis was still a baby when his Italian parents returned home, and he would spend the rest of his life in Milan. Acutis' family recalls him enjoying videogames including, of course, Halo, as well as the likes of Mario and Pokémon. He got a PlayStation when he was eight but, as a true servant of the Lord, restricted himself to one hour of play a day. It should also be said that Acutis was clearly a remarkable child.

We're building and testing every PC we highlight, and if we run into any issues, we'll explain them here. We're back with another build. This time, a compact white gaming PC, powered by AMD's top gaming CPU, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D , and a Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti Eagle OC Ice SFF .

The route you'll need to take looks a little like this: (Image credit: Team Cherry) Make sure you've got 60 rosaries before starting, ideally secured in the form of a consumable string or a necklace. Start at the halfway home bench, take the elevator, then hop across the rickety platforms to get into Sinner's Road proper.

That's because of the ever-present spectre of AI hanging over our gaming hardware hopes and dreams. After all, AI hardware is where Nvidia makes the vast majority of its money these days, and given the recent loosening of chip export restrictions, I'd say it's a safer bet that most of this memory is destined for China-friendly RTX Pro 6000 variants and the like. Boo. Still, ETnews reports that Nvidia has told Samsung to double up its GDDR7 production—according to its industry sources—and that the Korean DRAM manufacturer has duly responded. The sources are quoted as saying \"mass production is imminent\", although the outlet itself speculates that the GDDR7 is likely destined for AI accelerators. Still, why not both?

Here's an in-depth critique that's almost entirely difficulty-based , to which one commenter concurs : \"Hollow Knight started you off slow and steady, Silksong stabs you and kicks you for crying about it.\" \"Bad rosary economy, insane difficulty scaling, very few meaningful unlocks/upgrades, runbacks, locked into fighting bosses, contact damage stacking with normal hits, etc,\" writes one player in a thread decrying the 'git gud crowd' as hateful (it's one of those discourses, I'm afraid). There have, of course, been other threads saying no, it's not too hard —but rather than throw more quotes a…",

The special edition Breaker Series of Xbox Wireless controllers comes in three variations, but all feature an undeniably cool shattered look to them. The faceplates have a print of broken shapes that range in colour and transparencies. In the press images it creates this layered look, almost as if you've broken through several pains of ice and can see light coming from the surface. This is unsurprisingly most true of the Ice Breaker colour option, which uses cool blues and whites to create a frosty look. The face buttons reflect this colour combination creating a really cohesive design that almost looks like it would be cold to touch. This is topped off by matching darker grey-blue sticks and triggers, as well as a matt light blue back plate.

Scary, but fun. I beat 'em and ventured west, thinking things were looking up. Definitely not about to have my adventure ground to a halt by a fat bug with an absurd amount of health! Ah. Well, then. I doubt I'm the only Silksong player who ran into Greymoor's big boss, the extremely peeved Moorwing, like a sparrow smashing face-first into a sheet of plexiglass. This fight ruined me dozens of times over, and after a couple hours I started to resent it. If you likewise find yourself stuck on the fight and frustrated even after getting through two (or three!) phases of this slog of a battle, then I give you permission to stop wasting your time and kill Moorwing the quick, easy, and 100% safe way. Consider it just vengeance. I eventually decided to cheese this fight because: It's possible. I felt like I had experienced everything interesting the fight had to offer.

The inner life that elevates NPCs to characters who haunt their levels long after they're ragdolled. The name above the door of that business? AudioLog. It's only fitting, since the inventor of the audiolog was a writer on both Dishonored and its 2016 sequel. During the development of System Shock, Austin Grossman had helped figure out the fundamentals of the genre we now call the immersive sim.

I think part of that is just down to how we engage with music in videogames compared to any other medium. A film score might only n…",

This was extremely rare in PC gaming in general at the tail end of the nineties, and it makes System Shock 2 unique among the classic immersive sims. With its 25 th anniversary remaster, Nightdive Studios wanted to ensure this co-op functionality was brought up to date with the rest of System Shock 2. Yet according to producer Daniel Grayshon, getting it to work was a nightmare worthy of SHODAN herself. Speaking on the Nightdive Studios Deep Dive podcast, Grayshon explains the sticking point was how System Shock 2 uses an old-fashioned direct IP connection based on DirectPlay. \"[This] was a very old Windows built-in functionality to do some redirecting somewhere and ultimately try to end up at the destination,\" he says. Aside from DirectPlay being insecure by modern standards, Nightdive also wanted the remaster to support crossplay between PS5, Xbox, Switch and so forth. \"We need to strip this out, completely strip this out. We can't have direct connections anymore because the consoles will not allow that at all,\" Grayshon explains. \"We need to construct some kind of lobby system, and we need to tap…",

Monster and Monster's hybrid trucking sim dedicates itself to synthesising grand journeys across the cosmos with the specific vehicle handling and road networks of Euro Truck Simulator 2 . The combination was relatively well received by players when Star Trucker launched in 2024, earning itself a \"Mostly Positive\" rating on Steam out of just under 3,000 reviews. Now Monster and Monster is celebrating a whole year of interplanetary logistics, with the double delivery of an anniversary update and a big discount. Said anniversary update brings a container's worth of new features to Star Trucker, foremost among which is peripheral support. Henceforth, you can increase the realism of driving a rocket-propelled truck along roads strung through space by plugging in the joystick/steering wheel/custom Millennium Falcon dashboard of your choice. While the update is designed to accommodate the broadest range of peripherals possible, in a dev blog Monster and Monster points out that it is a small team and therefore \"it's …",

It expanded upon SnowRunner's logistics simulation with systems like convoy automation and an emphasis on constructing road networks (hence the name). But these bigger features came at the cost of a more simplistic driving model, leaving players who preferred the stern navigational challenge of SnowRunner put out. Now, though, Saber has released an update to RoadCraft that folds some of that driving complexity back in. Or at least, it gives players the option to reinstate it themselves if they so choose. The update adds a \"hard mode\" to RoadCraft in the form of several difficulty modifiers, each of which can be toggled on or off depending on how granular you want the experience to be. For driving fans, the key additions are limited fuel and \"realistic\" gearboxes—the latter of which basically means that RoadCraft now supports manual gear-shifting. Frankly, it's wild that RoadCraft launched without this functionality. Fuel management and manual driving are standard features in most dedicated driving sims, let alone a game born from the legacy of SnowRunner…",

July brought an improved mission system and more realistic erosion, while August saw the return of hardcore mode in tougher, meaner form. September's update is by far the smallest for a while. But there is one adjustment that has potentially game-altering ramifications, and it all has to do with the noise that guns make. Basically, Facepunch has altered how sound propagation for firearms works, so gunshots can be heard at significantly longer distances than before. Implementing this was more complicated than you might expect, as Facepunch explains in a Steam post : \"Networking range in Rust is made up of grids,\" the developer explains. \"These grids are a fixed size and can be adjusted by server owners, they are sometimes reduced on high-populated community servers to lower network overhead. When these grids are reduced, it also reduces things like: gun audio. This makes the world feel incredibly small and closed off.\" But Facepunch now says Rust can \"run gunshots at different distances to the network range\" though…",

Paradox noted that PlayStation customers will be able to place a new preorder for the game after it finally announces those adjustments on September 17th. \"Anyone who pre-ordered the Premium Edition through the PlayStation Store will be contacted and refunded starting Monday, September 8th,\" a Paradox representative wrote on the VTMB subreddit . \"You will be able to pre-order your Premium Edition copy again later, before the release on October 21st. Please note that this is an intentional first step in our planned course of action leading up to September 17th to deliver the best possible experience for you at launch.\" As for why this is only on PlayStation as opposed to other storefronts, our best guess is that the PlayStation Store won't allow the sor…",

Anthropic illegally downloaded the authors' books and used them to train its AI model. The total settlement for this case is the largest for any copyright case in U.S. history, although the payout to each affected author is only $3,000. The lawsuit, filed in August 2024 , accused Anthropic of benefiting from pirated copyrighted books, stating, \"An essential component of Anthropic’s business model—and its flagship 'Claude' family of large language models (or “LLMs”)—is the largescale theft of copyrighted works.\" It goes on to highlight the harm being done to authors, which goes beyond the theft of their work: \"Anthropic’s Claude LLMs compromise authors’ ability to make a living, in that the LLMs allow anyone to generate—automatically and freely (or very cheaply)—texts that writers would otherwise be paid to create and sell.

You may already be familiar with Covell's work—they also wrote Netflix's Kaos and The End of the F***ing World⁠—Netflix's censorship, not ours⁠—both of which are dripping in dark comedy. In a statement to Variety, Covell described helming the Life is Strange show as \"a huge honor,\" saying, \"I am a massive fan of the game, and I’m thrilled to be working with the incredible teams at Square Enix, Story Kitchen and LuckyChap. I can’t wait to share Max and Chloe’s story with fellow players and new audiences alike.\" Along with Covell, the series will also be executive produced by the Story Kitchen team, which is also working on adaptations of Tomb Raider , Split Fiction, and It Takes Two, all at Amazon.

How many Dragon Age games would you say there are? Only four, right? Origins, its sequel, Inquisition and last year's Veilguard. Not many, for a beloved franchise spanning a decade and a half at a major publisher. But then the BioWare team behind the series was often characterised as a pirate ship by colleagues: sailing haphazardly between projects and often drifting off course as it found its way to its next hit. Certainly, there was never a straightforward follow-up that built directly on the success of Origins. BioWare's pirates were routinely tossed about on the rough seas of EA's whims, following mandates for tight budgets or new engines or live service features. Those internal skirmishes added years to the development of mainline Dragon Age games, and we got fewer of them as a consequence. It's hard not to talk ab…",

Whether you're doing quests for them, joining them, fighting them, or grinding reputation to get that one rare armour set you can't live without, factions are often key to your experience with a game.

Would it even be possible to enjoy XCOM without a global coalition judging your performance after every mission? (Image credit: Bethesda) So, we've established that factions are important.
