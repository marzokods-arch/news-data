Not only is the Light Ground Transport (LGT) bad at its only job of safely transporting players from A to B, but despite its high mobility and machinegun nest, its lack of armor plating means your chance of survival goes down by climbing inside of one. It's like a coffin on wheels, but without the robust defensive capabilities of wood. It's no surprise that most BF6 players have made a habit of ignoring the LGT entirely by choosing to spawn directly on capture points or even run out of the HQ instead. Renegade_Soviet is not a normal BF6 player. Earlier today on the Battlefield subreddit, he posted a screenshot of something that I'd wager nobody else has seen in the wild: the Mad Max-ified \"Gold Standard\" skin for the LGT jeep, a reward for reaching rank 50 with the vehicle. \"Rank 50 for the death trap, never removing this badge,\" he wrote alongside the image. \"How,\" one commenter, who understood the implication of reaching the maximum level on a vehicle that's more likely to kill you than help you, replied.

Tavern Keeper arrived on Steam in November, but it's been in development for over a decade—and as impressive as the game is, that's a heck of a long development cycle, especially since it's expected to be in early access for at least another 12 months. I spoke last week with Patrick Klug, director and co-founder of Greenheart Games, and asked why the tavern sim took so long to belly up to the bar. \"We have made, like, six versions of this over the last 11 and a half years,\" Klug said, explaining that just the storybook system alone went through \"dozens of versions\" to become what is essentially an \"interactive audiobook\" where players get to make RPG-like dialogue choices while managing their pub. \"When we started, there were no tavern [management] games. When we started, there wasn't even a Two Point game out yet. We were before the management system revival, I think. And so we had to invent…",

The two big seasonal sales were separated, literally, by just a couple weeks: The 2024 Autumn Sale wrapped up on December 4, and the Winter Sale kicked off on December 15. That's just too much sale all mush into one month. But if you thought that the shifted Autumn Sale meant no discounts on Steam in late November, boy, were you ever wrong. Because for the first time ever, Valve has capitulated to the gods of e-commerce and is holding its very own Black Friday Sale . Unlike many online retailers, who view Black Friday as one of the most important sell stuff holidays* of the year, Steam's Black Friday Sale is a relatively small affair compared to the seasonal heavyweights: It runs for just one week, and there are no attendant Points Shop freebies or trading cards to earn for hammering through your discovery queue. Which is not to say there aren't some sweet deals on offer, because there are. One obvious choice is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 , which is 60% off its regular price—that's $24/£22/€24, the lowest it'…",

As Tom Warren noted at The Verge , Microsoft did something similar earlier this year for Office, adding a feature called \"Startup Boost\" that loads parts of the Word application in the background so that it can launch more quickly. While I'm all for snappy software, I am a bit skeptical that either Word or the File Explorer should be such heavy applications that they need to be silently loading elements in the background before you click on them.

Even after the tutorial, it's frustrating trying to actually win a match until you unlock the Scholar profession, which isn't made clear at all. To save you a lot of rematches, this guide explains how to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet by unlocking the Scholar profession, and goes through how Gift of the Gab actually works once you can play it without tears dripping onto your keyboard. How to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet Let's just get this out of the way first: You're not going to win any Gift of the Gab matches in Where Winds Meet until you complete the Legacy: Scholar's Path quest and unlock the Scholar profession .

When it finally burst from its coffin, the critical reaction ranged from mildly positive to firmly negative, with our own Fraser Brown giving it a respectable score of 78 in our Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 review. Yet whether players liked it or not, pretty much everyone agreed that The Chinese Room's sequel wasn't really a successor to Bloodlines at all, lacking the ridiculous roleplaying depth that makes Troika's original the brilliantly broken bloodsucking adventure it is. In fact, PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens pointed out that the biggest problem with Bloodlines 2 is that it is called Bloodlines 2 . As is so often the case, it appears Bloodlines 2's adoptive developers were highly aware of this potential problem.

Hashino also discussed how he's gearing up for what sounds like a literal upgrade to the JRPG genre, except there are no patch notes yet. As reported by 4gamer and translated by GamesRadar , Hashino sees the genre as three distinct eras—the past (JRPG 1.0), present (JRPG 2.0), and future (JRPG 3.0). The ' ghosts of JRPG past, present, and future ' would have switched up the story of A Christmas Carol a bit, and now I'm wondering what that looks like. According to Hashino, JRPG 1.0 encompasses the \"classics\", which is not a small number of enduring pioneers, including Final Fantasy—which continues to release entries to this day after more than 35 years—alongside Atlus' own Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series. JRPG 2.0 is the genre as it is now, the modern iteration with \"its current style, which feels higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player\"…",

Do all their desks really have wheels? What goes on in that black box? We may never know, but we can damn well estimate . Today's look into the crystal ball comes from research firm Alinea Analytics (via Tom's Hardware ). In a post on X, the firm's head of market analysis, Rhys Elliott, posted some estimates for just how many scads of cash Valve has pulled out of Steam this year. Turns out? A lot. So many scads. Alinea estimates that Steam has churned out about $16.2 billion in revenue in 2025, over $4 billion of which went to Valve itself (Valve, notoriously, takes a 30% cut on Steam purchases, a number that only gets lower after your product has raked in over $10 million).

This week I've been: clearing out my stash and filling it up just as quickly by engaging in more PvP. I've praised Arc Raiders a lot since launch, perhaps above all else because it's finally an extraction shooter that's forgiving and welcoming for a wider audience, even as a fan of the genre's traditionally hardcore roots. However, there's a degree to which Arc Raiders' obsession with a fair playing field is its own worst enemy, and it unfortunately strikes deep into its core: the gear system just isn't all that exciting. The confusion I've seen from people wondering what they're supposed to do after they've unlocked everything and completed all the quests should have an easy answer: get better loot, kill things, eventually lose it, and do it all over again. But high-end loot isn't a satisfying and rewarding chase. Firstly, the abundance and strength of free loadouts mean there are a lot of players risking literally nothing in PvP match after match, while those bringing in gear have a high chance of losing it all.

Needless to say, I choked and got downed by this gaggle of arcs. My team couldn't get to me in time, and I lost everything, including some items I needed for quests, what a gut punch. (Image credit: Embark) But it'll happen to us all at some point, playing Arc Raiders. Everyone pushes the boat out too far, gets forgetful, or clumsy. There's no shame, but it is infuriating when it happens to you, especially if you've got good loot in your loadout when it happens, which is exactly what happened to player seaskyways. \"I lost 100k worth of stuff in the stupidest way imaginable,\" seaskyways says in a Reddit post . \"I will not top this death anytime soon (hopefully).\" The player also adds a video alongside this post showing exactly how they slipped up.

His partner, Delbert McBride, confirmed the news to Variety . Kier appeared in over 200 films in the course of a long and remarkable career, and was perhaps best-known for his partnerships with Andy Warhol, Lars von Trier, and Werner Herzog. Though he also found time to appear in music videos for Madonna, Gwen Stefani, Korn, and others. So a varied career doesn't even begin to describe Kier's time on screens big and small, but to me he will always, first and foremost, be the utterly magnificent/absurd Yuri from Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge—a Transylvanian psychic who usurped control of the Soviet Union and launched an invasion of the United States, ultimately being defeated in Antarctica and imprisoned in a Psychic Isolation Chamber. Kier's unhinged performance helped define the games and is a big reason they continue to loom so large in the minds of fans. Kier was also slated to appear in Hideo Kojima's upcoming OD, appearing in the game's first reveal trailer in 2023. It's unclear ho…",

But, I was a little dubious when the Zooseum DLC was announced—this could be its own game, no? It felt less exciting, and a shift away from what was unique about Two Point Museum—there's an abundance of Zoo-based management sims out there after all. As usual, I needn't have worried. The first look at its gameplay alleviated any concerns about it stepping away from its wonderfully absurd roots to become a facsimile of Zoo Tycoon, as tortoises waddle by with vegetable gardens on their back—complete with shed—and tropical birds look like exotic plants. If you felt short-changed by the lack of a specific museum for Fantasy Finds, Two Point Studios is rectifying this by going all out for its biggest DLC so far, including \"100% more lions\" and a new museum location: Silverbottom Park.

This card was announced as a celebration of the company's 30th anniversary of selling graphics cards, and it's now officially launched at a price of, er, $4,000 . To be fair, while that's over $1,000 more expensive than you can find some other RTX 5090 cards going for, and $2,000 more than the Founders Edition RTX 5090's MSRP, it is also $3,000 cheaper than the gold-plated RTX 5090 Dhahab OC, which started retailing for about $7,000 back in May . There are levels to these things, I suppose. The new card's price tag isn't just down to its dashing good looks, which it does admittedly have in spades, and it's not only to do with its limited supply of 1,000 cards. It's also down to its buffed 800 W power draw. Given the default RTX 5090 pretty much maxes out the 12V-2x6 connector's max wattage, a second power connection is needed to get it up to 800 W. That's where the BTF connection comes in. To get this special edition GPU hooked up to all the juice that its cooling and VBIOS is designed to make use of, you'll need an \"Advanced BTF motherboard\" in addition t…",

But while the game's success was \"an inspiration\" according to CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski, it's not necessarily the direction development division CD Projekt Red (CDPR)'s games are headed. Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, Nowakowski said \"There was a lot of inspiration in what Baldur's Gate 3 did, but I think we're still sticking to what was in Witcher 3, Cyberpunk. But we don't want to just make another game like that, just with better graphics. We do want to innovate.\" As for how, Nowakowski didn't have anything to reveal just yet. But he doubled down on the fact that it wouldn't resemble Divinity or Baldur's Gate: \"We definitely are not going to make a game like Larian did. \"That's the kind of game they can make.

My melon-pult flings a watermelon across the screen where it collides with a zombie, knocking its head off. That's the body of a dead person that's just been decapitated. And it happens every few seconds! My lawn would be covered in human heads if they didn't magically disappear. Grisly. Watching my plants get eaten by zombies is also disturbing. My poor, brave tall-nut, weeping yet still defiant as zombies rip fistfulls of nutmeat from its body and shove them into their rotting mouths. Even replacing my ragged t-nuts with new ones is a bit horrifying: I don't think I'm healing them, I think I'm euthanizing them in favor of new recruits. Monstrous. And what happens to single-use plants like squashes and ice-shrooms when they're activated? They sacrifice themselves? Dying for the cause? This game is non-stop carnage even when you win.

If you've ever played Wild Guns or even Duck Hunt, you'll be familiar with the gallery shooter: arcadey games where you shoot into the screen at enemies as they pop in and out of the background. Contra has had levels like this in the past, but in Neon Inferno, you're both run-and-gunning and gallery shooting simultaneously: hold down the right bumper, and you swap your aim between the background and foreground. You might think this would get chaotic, and it does. Very quickly in fact, even in the 10-minute demo on Steam. That said, Neon Inferno is more forgiving than you might expect from the genre.

Titled Jason’s Military Service, Slightly Analyzed , the post runs thousands of words and reads more like a military history essay than a standard fan theory. Drawing on decades of US Army lore, historical citations, and deep Rockstar sleuthing, the author argues that Jason may have once served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, one of America’s most elite light-infantry units. The evidence? A blink-and-you-miss-it tattoo visible on Jason’s left arm—a skull beneath a parachute, framed by the word \"Marauders\".

I just had to exist with the knowledge that there was some sort of creature out there that scared my incredibly goth sister so much you couldn't even utter the name. As you can imagine, my child brain ran wild with theories of what it could look like from the vague descriptions she'd given which, in turn, petrified me. Until the day I remembered her terror and finally experienced Pyramid Head for myself. Don't get me wrong, Pyramid Head is a scary horror villain, however it's nowhere near what I was led to believe it would be.

Sektori is a twin-stick developed by former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen, most easily described as a roguelike take on Geometry Wars. Yes, it's another game that borrows that three-card upgrade system from Vampire Survivors and slaps it into a familiar experience, but not only does this work extremely well, it's also only a fraction of what makes Sektori great. I wrote a little about Sektori a while back, but at that point I'd only played the demo. I took an early copy on holiday with me a couple of weeks back, planning to check it out among a bunch of other games. Instead, I just played Sektori. For 40 hours.

The original Vermintide was a decent stab at Left 4 Dead -style cooperative action by developer Fatshark, but much like Valve's pioneering shooter, it has long been eclipsed by its superior sequel. Consequently, Fatshark has taken an interesting approach to celebrating a decade of rat-squashing, bringing one of Vermintide's \"most popular\" maps into Vermintide 2. Yet Return to the Reik isn't a straight port of Vermintide's distinctive River Reik, as Fatshark hints in a Steam post that \"Things are not as before\". River Reik was introduced in Vermintide's \"Death on the Reik\" DLC released in 2017. The DLC only has a 'Mostly Positive' Steam rating, which would seem to contrast with Fatshark's claims about its popularity. As mentioned, however, Return to the Reik isn't a straight rerun of the map. Fatshark says the new version brings \"expanded, boat-focussed gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and centre\".

But with the release of the Free Ride update, that's all changed. Well, slightly changed. Free Ride replaces Explore mode completely, offering a similarly open-ended experience while fleshing it out with actual stuff to do. Whether or not this stuff is worth doing is another question, but at the very least it's an improvement over nothing. Primarily, Free Ride introduces two new activity types—the old videogame staples of racing and combat. Races come in both car and horse varieties, though vehicles get substantially more love than their equine counterparts.

I'm not alone in that preference either: The Stealth Archer in Skyrim, which plays exactly how it sounds, is a memetic, fan-favorite playstyle in Bethesda's smash hit RPG, with guides , analysis , and love letters galore on YouTube and Reddit. Being obsessed with stealth in games, particularly Bethesda RPGs, I've always wondered about the Pagliarulo Connection: Bethesda's design director, who has contributed to all of the studio's games since Oblivion, got his development start at Looking Glass Studios, the legendary '90s developer of Ultima Underworld, System Shock, and Thief. Pagliarulo in particular designed two of Thief 2: The Metal Age's most fun levels: Life of the Party, a swanky gala infiltration that begins on the open rooftops of the surrounding district, and Precious Cargo, a pirate's cove hiding a steampunk submarine you have to stow away on. I got the chance to talk to Pagliarulo for an upcoming PC Gamer print retrospective about Bethesda's work on the Fallout series, and I …",

The game has switched up how many lanes it has, dropped half a dozen new heroes in one go , and now, majorly overhauled lane creep mechanics in what Valve calls a \"small update.\" Troopers, Deadlock's version of the lane creep you'd find in any given MOBA, grant souls on death which players exchange for items. In the past, you immediately got half the souls (split with nearby allies) when a trooper died and had to shoot the other half out of the air as it floated from the corpse. Now, the first half of the income also has to be manually secured—it will fall to the ground, and you'll have to walk within a short radius of the souls to claim them. Unlike the souls which have to be shot, these can't be denied by the enemy team and will appear translucent to them. Still, it will certainly lead to more fights breaking out in the laning phase; heroes that prefer to stay back and farm from afar will have to get closer to the action so they can snag those precious souls.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 first swung onto PS5 consoles towards the end of 2023, and breached the shores of Steam at the beginning of this year. Grand Theft Auto 5, on the other hand, followed the same two-year console-to-desktop pilgrimage a full decade earlier. (Image credit: Rockstar) That first time switching between Michael or Franklin or Trevor was a wonderful feeling, as the camera moved skyward, birds-eye-view and in slow-motion, before darting in a different direction across the map and landing back at ground level; you now in control of someone else altogether. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a game that comes close to the same feeling and masterful execution of the mechanic besides Insomniac's Spidey sequel. Back in 2013, it was a watershed moment for the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole. Not only was it cool, it was the first time we were able to guide different playable protagonists through missions and swap paths on the fly—something that lent itself well to GTA 5's often open-end…",
