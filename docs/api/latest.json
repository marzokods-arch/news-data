Its chip fabs are mostly based in Taiwan , but it does also have one fab in Japan, two in China and, more pertinently to this story, two in the USA: one 8-inch fab in Washington, and one 12-inch fab in Arizona. However, neither of these lattermost fabs are TSMC's very best, nor will they ever be. TSMC is accelerating its plans for 1.4 nm silicon manufacturing , with the hopes of going into full production in 2027. However, according to the Central News Agency , that bleeding-edge tech won't be coming to TSMC's stateside fabs any time soon due to Taiwan's ‘National Core Technologies’ regulations (via Dan Nystedt on X ). As per these regulations, TSMC can only transfer production tech that is at least two generations old to its fabs outside of Taiwan. This point arose during the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee, when Taiwan People's Party legislator Liu Shu-pin expressed concern about how the Taiwanese government can ensure key R&D advancements in semiconductor tech stay in Taiwan. National Science Council Vice Chairman Lin Fa-cheng reassured that the list of 'national core …",

Learning about both the technology and the mechanics seemed, to us, safer than to just try to go and release a whole standalone product called Ark 2.\" Stieglitz said that many mechanics and features in Ark 2 will be introduced first in Legacy of Santiago, a major expansion for Ark: Survival Ascended that will also serve as \"a prequel to Ark 2 that basically directly ties into that narrative.\" Le…",

DBOX02 Pro is a 4K gaming projector that wants to take over your living room with thumping speakers, immense projection size, and a wildly adaptable auto keystone. It's an attempt to replace your TV and your Hi-Fi system with something altogether compact and stylish, that won't falter when the sun comes shining in. While there are plenty of TV replacement projectors out there vying for that spot in your home entertainment system, few have the chops to nail gaming too. That's where the Dangbei DBOX02 Pro comes in. Smooth and shiny on the front, this mostly matt black cube features subtly rounded edges and a lightly curved facade. It's a modern aesthetic that proudly flaunts a touch of those lovable retro vibes, without being smothered in buttons and dust-catching greebles. The projector itself sits atop a seamless stand that grips it on either side. It allows for a 360 degrees rotation and 120 degree tilt for ceiling projection. There's none of that twisting the little feet to get the perfect angle, either, since the DBOX02 Pro comes with an impeccable InstanPro AI auto key…",

Even if they’re slightly too infatuated with a difficulty curve they purchased from the rectangle factory. I thought all deckbuilders had to be roguelikes by law, so it’s paradoxically a little refreshing to play one that follows a more traditional game structure.

With a total estimated shipment of 2.62 million in the third quarter of 2025, this means that OLED monitor shipments have grown by 84% year-on-year. Trendforce also lays out which companies these orders are from. Asus sits at the very top of the pile, enjoying a 21.9% share. You can see the full stats below. Company Market Share Asus 21.9% Samsung 18% MSI 14.4% LG Electronics 12.9% Others 32.7% Naturally, shipping figures and total sales are different metrics, though they are linked. As items sell better, stores will naturally stock more. It's also worth noting that Trendforce's analysis encompasses all OLED monitors, not just OLED gaming monitors. For example, Asus has a whole range of ProArt OLED productivity monitors, which definitely helps that market share.

But another band could make it.\" But that would require Battlefield Studios—made up of DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion and Motive—and EA itself to take a massive risk, something the publisher isn't exactly famous for doing. \"If they choose to make it, they are choosing, in their own minds, to make a product that is going to have a smaller subset of buyers,\" says Goldfarb, \"just by virtue of the fact that humour is subjective.

Amazon began to suspect something was amiss when it looked at the keystroke data from a new IT hire. To the company's knowledge, the employee was US-based so there should have been a comfortably less than 100 millisecond delay between them typing commands on their corporate laptop, and those inputs reaching the head office in Seattle. However, the delay was in fact 110 milliseconds, suggesting the employee was based further afield than first thought. Amazon’s Chief Security Officer Stephen Schmidt communicated to Bloomberg a bizarre bigger picture. It turns out the employee with the lag was in fact a North Korean attempting to skirt international sanctions and funnel money back into the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (or DPRK) via remote work.

It's called In the Jungle, and it's not just adding more Dave the Diver to the Dave the Diver—it's doing something completely new. The DLC is set in a new location, a village in a jungle beside a freshwater lake. The fact that it's freshwater is interesting: you don't make sushi from that kind of fish, so you've got a new type of restaurant to run. Welcome to Bancho Grill! (Image credit: Mintrocket) What's even more interesting is the break from the standard Dave the Diver formula. Yes, you still dive, catch fish, and battle bosses, but the village is a place you can freely walk around, as if Dave is visiting Stardew Valley. Instead of the days being broken up into morning, afternoon, and night segments, as in the base game, the island takes place in real-time, giving you the freedom to manage your schedule as you fish, socialize, and work at the grill. You can even explore with Dave's friends, like Cobra, following you around. Plus, it's presented in a new isometric …",

Normally the preserve of big tech events like CES and Computex, AMD has decided to buck that trend and quietly launch a new Radeon RX 9060 XT graphics card. Its unique selling point? A marginally lower power limit. There was no announcement behind the launch whatsoever, as AMD just dropped the new card into its product pages , alongside its other Radeon models (via BenchLife ). Simply labelled as the Radeon RX 9060 XT LP, it's literally just a normal 16 GB RX 9060 XT that's had its 160 W power limit reduced to 140 W. The product page doesn't mention any changes to clock speeds, but these have been lowered, too, as this can be inferred from AMD's listed theoretical performance figures. For example, where the standard RX 9060 XT has an FP32 vector rate of 25.6 TFLOPS, the LP version is stated as being 25 TFOPS. Going through all the metrics, the RX 9060 XT LP has clock speeds that are between 2 and 3% lower than the standard XT's, so instead of a boost clock of up to 3130 MHz, you're looking at 3050 MHz.

That's because a critical flaw was recently found that allows cheaters to bypass hardware-based security checks and potentially inject code before Riot's Vanguard anti-cheat can wake up. As laid out in the Riot Games blog (via Tom's Hardware ), Valorant relies on IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) to check the ID of your memory and only allow greenlit devices to get access. In the BIOS/firmware, your motherboard has Pre-Boot DMA Protection, which uses IOMMU to prevent a rogue device from accessing your system as it boots up. This means, once you're into the operating system, your device assumes all is good and continues as normal. The blog post says, \"In some cases, hardware manufacturer firmwares incorrectly signaled to the operating system that this feature was fully active, when it was actually failing to initialize the IOMMU correctly during early boot.\" This means someone getting in before those security functions boot up can effectively bypass the security, and \"by the time the system is fully loaded, it can’t be 100% confident that 0 inte…",

At the same time, it also revealed that the new operating system would be home to another major software release: DirectX 12 . It's been a decade since both were officially released, but while Windows 10 has been shuffled off into the realms of 'end of life' support, DirectX 12 has grown to become the most comprehensive collection of graphics APIs ever created. To celebrate this fact, Microsoft has published a short blog detailing some of the major improvements and upgrades that DirectX 12 has enjoyed over the years. For some folks, especially those who have been involved with PCs for as long as I have, it will only seem like yesterday when the new API was let loose. However, ten years is a long time in PC gaming. For example, back in 2015, Intel's four-core i7 6700K was the best gaming CPU you could buy. Since then, however, not only has Intel released nine further generations of chips, with the most recent sporting up to 24 cores, but the processor of choice for discerning gamers has switched to being an AMD one. It's a similar story with graphi…",

Thus it reached me through the grapevine (some people call it Polygon ) that Brennan Lee Mulligan was changing D&D forever, shaking things up, the madman, the maverick! He was doing so by, as the video below from the official Critical Role channel details, allowing players to level up at a time of their choosing—doing the pesky things like rolling for HP in advance, but otherwise letting them hold off until a satisfying moment occurred. \"We're going to prepare for a level up, that, actually—we don't know exactly when it will occur.

The publisher, Humble Games, still technically exists, but it's dormant, with a website that proudly announces the launch of Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus as if it happened yesterday, even though it released in July 2024. (The pay-what-you-want Humble Bundle store is still around; both it and the publisher are owned by media company Ziff Davis.) Things turned out relatively well for Bō, which has a \"Very Positive\" rating on Steam with over 1,000 user reviews and just got a big free update . But when Stair opened that matter-of-fact email in a Kyoto hotel room and learned that everyone he'd been relying on to manage the launch was no longer employed, the stress was tremendous.

As a big fan of the genre, I can confidently say that first-person dungeon crawlers harkening back to King's Field (or recent trendsetter, Lunacid) have reached that point. But the upcoming Queen's Domain deserves to be raised up from the crowd. We recently featured Queen's Domain in the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted showcase, and its aesthetics really caught my eye. Everything's all crunchy and dithered, but the art and assets are clearly gorgeous and well-crafted underneath⁠—we're very deliberately lo-fi here, not just 'cuz. In addition to the genre-standard medieval/renaissance gear and guys, Queen's Domain zags a bit by setting the game on a tropical island, with ancient, mossy stone ruins that call to mind Mayan cities or, in videogame speak, the Ruins of Rauh from Elden Ring. Maybe that one zone in Sonic 2 . The music is also killer, a euphoric, PS2-inflected sound cut with primal percussion and funkier instruments I can'…",

Intergalactic was revealed at The Game Awards 2024 with a long cinematic that landed (for me, at least) as kind of a mashup of Uncharted with Ready Player One, in space: Porsche-branded ship, Sony audio player, anime on the TV, and Pet Shop Boys on CD. Studio boss Neil Druckmann later said the game, despite its clear action trappings, is \" about faith and religion ,\" which is an interesting pitch, but we really haven't heard anything about it since.

      "body": "As it did to many in my generation, Pokémon Snap left an indelible imprint on my childhood psyche. Even at a young, tender age, I admired the rarity of a game that celebrated the simple act of observing creatures in their natural habitat instead of attacking them on sight. I'm all for fighting fake creatures, of course—I wouldn't have spent a decade scrapping lizards for their parts in Monster Hunter otherwise. But sometimes it's just nice to look. Pokémon Snap did have a problem, however: Professor Oak thought it was fine to pay with exposure. No matter how many valuable shots of Pikachu I sent him, it didn't put any cash in my pocket that I might have spent on cool hats or shirts. Thankfully, there's finally a game willing to properly reward my talents in wildlight photography: Flock Around, a multiplayer photography game that brings friendslop a Peak-like experience to birdwatching. (Image credit: Secret Plan Games) After firing up the Flock Around demo on Steam and customizing my genre-standard colorful beanshaped avatar, I soon learned something about birds: They're harder to photograph than Pokémon.

In a new effort to set the record straight, Vincke said today that Larian will hold an AMA in the new year, giving gamers an opportunity to learn more about how developers at Larian actually get things done. Larian's AI controversy erupted earlier this week in the wake of a Bloomberg interview in which Vincke touched on some of the ways developers at the studio are making use of generative AI tools. He made clear that the studio isn't using generative AI for any in-game content, like art, writing, or voices, but that did little good: The backlash against what was perceived as Larian's pro-AI stance was immediate and fierce. Vincke tried to smooth things out with a subsequent post on X in which he was more specific about how exactly Larian developers use generative AI, but that did not satisfy many of the studio's fans. So now the plan is to let the developers themselves jump into the fray…",

Della Bitta spent 10 years across two stints at Blizzard, as well as two years as general manager of Riot Games in North America. More recently, he was a co-founder of Dreamhaven , the developer and publisher headed up by former Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime. But it's the departure of Ohlen that strikes me as the most notable development here, at least from a gamer's perspective. A 22-year BioWare veteran with lead design and director credits on everything from the original Baldur's Gate to Anthem, Ohlen took the wheel of a then-unnamed new development studio at Wizards of the Coast in 2019; Exodus, the studio's first project, was revealed at The Game Awards in 2023 .

Nobody has decided on an official name for it because it utilizes a bunch of different skills, but it's technically an \"auradin\" build like the ones you'd see during the days of Diablo 2. However, I propose that we start calling it the aura farmer build because the engine running everything is a holy aura that burns nearby monsters when you have a unique pair of gloves on. What's better than a single holy aura? 11 holy auras, obviously. In addition to surrounding your character, you can summon a pack of wolves and an ally mercenary who will inherit the aura too. Now, you have a whole team of aura farmers that leave a trail of ash in their wake.

The project leader Viktor Tóth said at the time he wasn't happy with how they'd implemented the shooting response, and four years later the team is back with a new setup that significantly expands what the rats can do ( first spotted by Tom's Hardware ). And this time, the rodents are rocking a trigger mechanism. The first version had the rats suspended in a harness over a ball that rotated when they moved, with that movement mapped to a simplified version of a Doom corridor with an imp at the end. When the rat did the right things, it would get a reward in the form of sweetened water. The limitations meant that it was a bit of a stretch to say the rats were playing Doom, but as Tóth said you could make a decent argument they were \"kinda\" playing Doom.

Light of Motiram store pages have been taken down, and Sony and Tencent have each agreed to cover their own legal fees. “SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,\" Tencent Americas head of communication Sean Durkin confirmed in a statement provided to PC Gamer. \"SIE and Tencent look forward to working together in the future.” Light of Motiram's more-than-passing similarity to Sony's Horizon games, Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, were immediately apparent when the game was revealed in 2024 .

Maybe that's the best compromise: Blueprints have felt pretty stingy in Arc Raiders since launch. I've played for nearly 50 hours and haven't managed to find more than seven—to be fair, I'm not looking all that hard, but it's strange that other rare loot (like fancy guns and gadgets) are significantly easier to find than the blueprint for items that aren't even that good, like muzzle brakes. That was probably the aim of raising drop rates in the first place, though Embark never actually confirmed it raised them in the first place until today's hotfix.

Turns out that this was a minor miscalculation on developer Embark's part, but only a minor one: the developer has now issued a hotfix that sees the blueprint drop rates \"slightly lowered\" though they remain \"higher overall than before.\" Now a further Christmas gift has been issued to all raiders. Log in to Arc today and you'll find Scrappy, the most demanding chicken in the world, serving up a cool 1,000 raider tokens for free. That's an amount that would normally cost you around $10 and, what's arguably more important, enough to buy a shiny new skin for your raider (or a hat for Scrappy). The gift is a tiny bit buried-away. You'll need to check your mail in-game, which is an icon in the top right of the inventory screen, and then open the email titled \"Happy Holidays!\" from the developers. Then you're all set. Oh, one more thing. I can't verify this, because I'm not a dirty cheater, but Embark previously implemented punishments for players who exploited a door glitch in the game: they'd get roasted alive upon glitc…",

I did take the piss out of those guys, more than once. Not because I didn't like them, but because I did.\" Goldfarb tells us that DICE pushed itself \"to do stuff maybe you wouldn't do if they were not there\".

However, Asus has warned that many of its Intel motherboards are vulnerable and can allow access to system memory, which is enough to make anyone sit up and pay attention. Asus does point out on its security advisory page that although the problem is widespread and has a CVE rating of 7 (High severity), the vulnerability does require local access to the motherboard in order to gain access to the system RAM. The problem relates to the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) and add-on PCIe devices. The former has all kinds of protection mechanisms for direct memory access (DMA) operations, but Asus doesn't fully activate them on its Intel motherboards until just before the operating system is able to take over DMA protection duties. In other words, between first booting up the motherboard and the OS managing DMA operations, there's a window of opportunity for someone to use a PCIe device to gain access to system memory. That's obviously not a good thing, hence Asu…",

Parent company Monotype Imaging, which bought Fontworks back in 2023, then introduced a new pricing structure costing easily fifty times as much as the old plan (via Automaton ). US-owned Monotype's pricing structure initially offered no local pricing for Japan, but still expected devs to cough up $20,500 per year, in addition to agreeing to a ridiculous 25,000-user cap on games using the licensed fonts. Thankfully, the parent company has backpedalled a bit since, allowing developers to extend their licenses under the old affordable plan for the time being.

Even the title is a calligram: the umlauted O is our hero—the umlaut represents their ears—while the lowercase os are the bombs they carry around. In this puzzle metroidvania, the hero (let's just call them Ö from now on) can't really do much except explode those bombs. There is no jumping, no mantling, no attacking, no nothing, unless it can be achieved via the detonation of a bomb. When Ö starts with one bomb things seem simple enough: to jump, I spawn a bomb beneath myself and detonate. If I place a bomb and stand to the left of it before detonating, I'll be propelled leftward, which can be useful to clear a pit. Eventually Ö gets a second bomb, which offers a little more manoeuvrability while further complicating the puzzles. All this points to a clever but by no means revelatory puzzle game.
