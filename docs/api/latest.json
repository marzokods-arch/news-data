Why not? Because it slopes backward, and they'll end up on the floor. The front support foot is slightly taller than the back one, giving it a lean of, if a fun 10 minutes spent with a spirit level and a child's protractor have produced correct results, about 10 degrees. This means you can still rest your coffee mug on the top, as long as it's not too full, but also that, if you're buying this smaller-than-average tower PC with the intention of it flitting flush with a piece of furniture, it won't. This may or may not be a problem, depending on how picky you are about these things, but the Predator logo that sticks off the front and looks rather like someone melded a Space Invader with a Decepticon means you might want to push it back a little further.

      "body": "Here's some great news out of LG. The company has unveiled a new OLED panel that runs at a high refresh rate and uses an RGB Stripe subpixel layout. If you're not familiar with subpixel layouts, here's why that's a very good thing. Today's OLED gaming monitors have an issue. Not a huge one for gaming—any OLED is superb for playing games on—but more noticeable on some panels than others when you're browsing your desktop. It's especially noticeable if you're regularly typing out pages of words. It's called text fringing. Text fringing, as the name suggests, appears as a colourful border around characters rendered on an OLED panel. Sort of like a chromatic aberration effect in-game. It happens because the subpixels—red, green, and blue—don't align exactly with how the text is being rendered. In some OLED panels, that's because the subpixels are arranged in a triangular pattern, though LG's popular panels include a white subpixel in an RGWB structure. Text fringing is most obvious on panels with lower pixel densities, so namely 1440p monitors, though it'd be better to be rid of it completely. Well, that's what LG is offering with its latest OLED panel. Announced ahead of CES 2026, LG'…",

It's heavy and awkward too, but that's the price you pay for having everything you need in a gaming PC as well as proper airflow. Acer's case for the 2025 Predator Orion 7000 is an excellent example of the type. It's big and roomy and weighs a ton, with enough glass to satisfy your curiosity about what's going on inside and three light-up fans on the front to look good. There are three more fans at the top—the CPU is liquid cooled with an AIO—an intake at the back, and the GPU is vertically mounted so its cooling system is on display. This is a PC that wants to leave you in no doubt that it's on top of its heat dissipation. The front of the PC is the part you'll see most often, and Acer has chosen to place a 3D Predator logo behind a transparent front panel that stands proud of the case itself, a mesh-sided extrusion that gives hot air somewhere to escape around the edges and has a good, deep power button on the top you can easily find while groping around beneath your desk. It's a well-appointed case too, with a removable caddy for a second SSD that simply slips out of the top aft…",

The lava-filled caves of the Forgotten Kingdom become quite a challenge without equipment upgrades, but the Roblox RPG has the perfect solution for any mining gear woes. The Arcane Pickaxe is available in Stonewake's Cross, but you'll need to navigate through the deepest depths of the first zone's cave to get your hands on it. It's not a quest I'd suggest rushing, even if you help the Bard find his lost instrument early on. The higher level zombies really take a bite out of your HP in bigger mobs. How to get the Arcane Pickaxe in The Forge You can get the Arcane Pickaxe for $125,000 in The Cave, the first zone's mining spot, after completing the Bard's lost guitar quest. It's easy to complete in just a few minutes when you know where to look, but making use of the Bard's Unknown Key takes patience. It's not worth proceeding if you don't have the cash, and I wound up waiting until I was on the last Goblin King quest before going back to buy the pickaxe. It's possible to complete all five without The Forge's best pickaxe, but…",

Offline modes will continue to function as normal. That might seem like an awfully short window of existence for a major, mainstream videogame, but believe it or not the server shutdown date is actually an extension: WWE 2K24's online features were originally set to be killed on January 5. It's also a fairly standard period of full functionality for 2K's WWE games. WWE 2K23 servers took a piledriver in January 2025 , 2K22 servers ate an RKO in '24, and four pre-2K21 games were put through tables at the same time in 2022. Players can take some comfort in the fact that offline modes will continue to work as usual, so this isn't a Crew-like situation where the game will be rendered completely unplayable.

Behind the scenes, developers at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics were desperately trying to save the project, but these efforts would come to naught: a last-ditch attempt involving publisher Take-Two collapsed when no agreement could be reached over the IP rights . There was also debate over how much of the ace-looking reveal had been smoke-and-mirrors, with one dev angrily refuting the idea there wasn't a game there . Joanna Dark's voice actor Alix Wilton Regan was vocal about the cancellation at the time, and has now given a new interview to The Gamer in which she expands on what had been done on the game, and the \"devastating\" decision to cancel it. \"I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed,\" says Wilton Regan. \"I did not see it coming.

I've often gone on record to defend parrying on this site, despite the haters: Done well, these games are awesome. Parry fatigue? Bah, I say! I get that seeing a parry in every action RPG is getting a smidge wearisome, but if a game's built around timed blocking, rather than just using it as an excuse to ignore balance? It can become a delicious game of rock, paper, scissors that sees you riding a knife's edge between victory and death. Redirecting lightning at the top of Ashina Castle is utterly imprinted onto my memory, nothing else can compare.

Fortunately, they were pulled out of the spiral, by none other than the creator of the game they'd worried about in the first place. This all transpired over on the subreddit r/IndieDev, on which neophyte indie designer Sbibble relayed his concerns in a post titled \"The game I've been working on for months is exactly the same as a game I just discovered today. What do I do?\" Explaining the situation, Sbibble wrote that he started a new project in October built in the Godot engine which is \"sort of like Enter the Gungeon , but with a spell system like in Noita .\" While aware that the concept \"isn't exactly original\" Sbibble felt the blend of the two ideas lent the game sufficient novelty.

One question put to Kojima ( timestamp ) relates to Metal Gear Solid 2, saying that AI control in the world is \"becoming a reality\" and asking whether Kojima predicted this era. To sum up in a sentence, and obviously spoilers ahead, MGS2 takes a very weird turn in its second half, with 'reality' collapsing around the protagonist Raiden as the player sits through a series of monologues about digital control, junk data, and our inability to parse the bewildering amounts of information created by the modern world.

Numerous game developers offered their perspectives on the issue. Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth's director Naoki Hamaguchi stated there is \"definitely a need for that kind of thing\" in games, even if players don't like it, while The Witcher 4's lead designer believed the problem \"isn't necessarily the yellow paint\", but the context in which it was used, and that level designers needed to \"properly weaponise the entire arsenal of your toolkit\" to prevent players from realising that \"'oh, I'm being guided'\".

John Carmack's reproduction of the smooth scrolling effect seen in Nintendo's platformer ultimately led to the founding of id Software and the creation of Commander Keen . In turn this led to Wolfenstein 3D , and ultimately to Doom . Yet as id Software prepared to revolutionise PC gaming, its publisher, Apogee, took the tech id had developed for Commander Keen and made its own take on the 2D platformer. The result was Bio Menace, a platform shooter in which you battle through a city infested with mutants as all-American action hero Snake Logan. Bio Menace was created almost entirely by programmer Jim Norwood, who worked on the Duke Nukem Trilogy and, later, the original Shadow Warrior and its 2013 reboot. Apogee released Bio Menace as freeware in 2005, and it can be played online in various places. But the original has, understandably, aged quite a bit. Fortunately, a remaster just released on Steam, sprucing up this classic blaster for modern players. Developed by Rigel Gameworks, BioMenace Remastere…",

No cars, no luxury pads, not even a Michelin Star meal. Nope, what Beer splashed out on was something a bit more understated: \"A real winter coat\". It's hard not to be charmed by this, just as I was when Zach Adams bought a humble Honda Civic after Dwarf Fortress shifted 800,000 copies. To be fair, he and his wife also purchased a house. But still, these are practical purchases rather than ridiculous spending sprees. Beer says his new coat is \"a luxury that was somehow never important enough, but still something I always wanted\". He spent four years making Super Fantasy Kingdom, and during that time he admits he was \"just living for the game\". He realises this \"sounds horrible\", but he loved it. \"Having such a big goal to slowly work towards, something that has real meaning to you, is such a rewarding process.

Recently, the studio's former director Harvey Smith discussed these events and how they affected the team on the My Perfect Console podcast (via Kotaku ). \"I got a call the night before and spent a very stressful night thinking about that, every company makes the decisions they make for the reasons they make them. I don't agree with them often,\" Smith told host Simon Parkin. \"It was a shock, because we had done really good work, and this is a group of people, in some cases, who had worked together for one project [and] in other cases, like me and Ricardo Bare [ Prey: Mooncrash 's creative lead] for instance, had worked together since the late nineties.\" The l…",

The first Brutalist Jam occurred in 2022, spawning 35 maps that were bundled together and released as a single mod. A second Brutalist Jam took place the following year, producing 30 more delightfully grey, angular constructions to blast your way through. Both Jams seemed like impressive achievements at the time. But this year's Brutalist Jam blows both previous events out of the water. After kicking off in October, the Quake Brutalist Jam 3 has received a whopping 75 entries created by the Quake community. For context, the original version of Quake contains 37 maps. Why has this Jam proved so much more popular than the previous ones? Well, it might be partly down to word of mouth spreading, and the Jam didn't run last year, which likely encouraged people who feared they missed out to take part this year. But on top of that, Quake Brutalist Jam 3 doesn't just use vanilla Quake as its foundation…",

If you were hoping for one of those alien orangutans who are also scientific geniuses I can see how a new character who is basically just the gang punk who gets beat up by the hero in act one of an action movie could seem underwhelming. If you wanted to play a Sister of Battle in full power armor and were instead offered a normal drug addict, I sympathize. The way the Darktide subreddit immediately filled their nappies in rage over the hive scum reveal was a bit much, though. The hive scum wasn't what I expected, but after leveling one up, it's actually a super fun class to play. Maybe \"dual-wielding\" isn't as big a deal as it was in the Rise of the Triad days, but having a character class who can shoot two pistols at once makes clearing crowds deliciously easy.

Early on there's one where you're hurled into a town as it's besieged by the undead, running through collapsing buildings until you can get to a ballista and shoot a shambling zombie cyclops. The next one happens when the magic crystal you're in town to deliver gets stolen right in front of you by a ghoul, and you have to chase it across rooftops in the darkness and rain. To keep up you jump across gaps, clamber up chains, squeeze through windows, and don't fall to your death as timbers creak and collapse beneath you. It's like the chase from Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth only in reverse, because here you're pursuing rather than being pursued and also you've got a snowflake's chance of getting it right first go.

AnyAustin closed the year with a bang: A characteristically whimsical investigation of how many trees there are in the entirety of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim , but with a twist. He recruited 10 internet gaming personalities and one secret VIP guest to submit their own arboreal estimations, with the winner earning a $10,000 donation to the charity of their choice. For AnyAustin's own process, he attempted three different estimations in increasing order of rigor: Vibes-based, walking around, counting trees in a few spots and going \"eh, seems right:\" 41,500.

Dishonored, for instance, is definitely an immsim; it simulates a lot of factors that respond to the player, boasts open-ended levels, and encourages all sorts of emergent shenanigans. But those same things are broadly true of Far Cry Primal, a game that probably isn't an immsim, or at least not acknowledged as one by immsim fans. How can that be? Well, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain took to his YouTube channel Monday to try and get down to brass tacks. It might seem like an odd subject for Cain to tackle, given that, as he notes in the video, \"so many of my hundreds and hundreds … of videos are me talking about roleplaying games because that's pretty much all I've made since 1993.\" He has even tried to define \"RPG\" in the past, which seems even harder than defining immsim because there are a hell of a lot more of them. But Cain said he sees a lot of overlap between the two genres' design goals and wants to hone in on a definition for both anyway. His definition boils down to th…",

I didn't like Dawntrail's story very much. Okay, that's not entirely true—I liked some of Final Fantasy 14 's latest expansion. I liked certain scenes, I liked certain ideas, I liked certain overarching themes; I especially liked the scenery. But the actual moment-to-moment storytelling was so clumsily executed that I was left genuinely baffled. It's a real shame, too, because the changeover from long-time writing lead Natsuko Ishikawa should've been a great opportunity to get some fresh blood into the mix. Ishikawa's been helming the story since Shadowbringers, and she's done a sterling job. I was open to a change, though, since I'd never expect a writer to stay in the same position on the same project forever.

Like anthropomorphic rabbits and Jesus, software developers love an Easter egg. Microsoft is no different. For most of its history, the Windows developer has inserted hidden jokes and references into many, if not most of its programs. These range from a Utah teapot that appears in Windows 95's Pipes screensaver, to a secret magic 8-ball toy inside Microsoft Access. But the most famous, or should I say, infamous Microsoft Easter egg is The Hall of Tortured Souls, a Doom-style 3D maze hidden inside Excel 95 that displays the credits of the designers who worked on it. Not only is it one of the more elaborate Easter eggs concealed in a Microsoft product, but this innocuous secret would also become the epicentre of a bizarre Internet rumour that Bill Gates was the Antichrist.

Once sold out, it will no longer be available.\" The disclaimer still there , and at least in the US, that original model is sold out for good. It may not have the delectable, vivid colors of the OLED version, but it was a hell of a workhorse for the price. PC Gamer's Jeremy Laird called it a \" stellar deal \" when the price dropped a few months back and I'm inclined to agree with him; PC gaming has a reputation for its high financial barrier to entry, so to have a handheld option with bespoke UI and docking functionality for under $400 was a pretty wild value proposition (even with consoles on the table). That said, there's a new handheld PC or gaming-centric Android what feels like every day now and Valve has hardware ambitions beyond the Deck, so it makes…",

Whether you agreed with our picks or not, I hope you were entertained to read about why we loved them so much. Of course, 2025 was also the year I developed a terrible compulsion to turn everything that happens around here into trivia questions. So, inevitably, it's time for the first ever official PC Gamer GOTY quiz! There's a question in there for each of the 14 games we gave an award to this year. Some are pretty easy, some are pretty hard, and hopefully some will make you curious to go play something you didn't get around to in 2025.
