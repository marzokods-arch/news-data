If you feel the same, it sounds like a great time to dive into Fallout 76 because it's completely free to play from now until February 5, which will carry you through to the Fallout Season 2 finale next week. If you want to wear that dope NCR power armor from the show in Fallout 76, though—that ain't free. That ain't even close to free. The Fallout 76 Mojave Bundle , which includes that tasty NCR armor skin, a Legion Legate outfit, an NCR flag and neon New Vegas sign, a fancy lookin' new super sledge, and a few other odds and ends, will run you $30 USD. That's pretty steep, especially considering everything else Fallout related is on sale on Steam at the moment.

This hasn't changed much since 2021 , when GDC reported that 31% of devs use generative AI, but how they feel about it has dramatically shifted. This year, 52% of the more than 2,300 respondents said that they \"think generative AI is having a negative impact on the game industry,\" according to the report's author, Beth Elderkin, who notes that just 18% said the same thing two years ago, and 30% last year. The opposite opinion, that generative AI is good for the industry, was only found in 7% of this year's respondents, a decline from 13% last year. The people least likely to approve of generative AI are who you'd expect: artists, designers, writers, and programmers. The people who use AI the most are also who you'd expect. Ever since CEOs started hyping the technology as a productivity elixir, skeptics have suspected that the executive class is more likely to personally rely on chatbots, and GDC's survey results are consistent with that hypothesis. \"Business professionals' usage (58%) far out…",

Some countries over the past year have issued travel advisories or cautions for people headed to the US: Canada, for instance, issued a warning in 2025 that anyone with a gender-neutral passport could face difficulty entering the country because of an executive order signed by Trump directing the government to recognize only two \"sexes,\" male and female. The US is also home to a large number of developer conferences and events, and that leaves developers with a tough choice: Put themselves at risk of detention or worse, or miss out on potentially vital opportunities for networking and promotion, which can be particularly important for smaller indie devs. Despite the high cost missing these events can incur, GDC's 2026 State of the Game Industry survey indicates that nearly one-third of industry employees who don't live in the US have cance…",

      "body": "The organizers of GDC have released its 2026 State of the Game Industry Report , detailing the results of its annual self-reported survey of games industry professionals. The data provided by over 2,300 respondents offered a grim image of industry layoffs, as 28% of surveyed games industry workers reported that they had been laid off in the past two years. That percentage was even higher in the United States, where 33% of respondents said they'd been laid off during the same period. 17% of surveyed games industry workers reported having been laid off in just the last 12 months, while half of respondents said their current or most recent employer had conducted layoffs in the last year. The survey results indicate that widespread layoffs remain a persistent issue in the games industry, having intensified during the transition into the post-pandemic era and the fallout of industry expansion and acquisition. More than 16,000 games industry workers lost their jobs between January 2023 and January 2024. 2025 offered little reassurance that the losses would stabilize as job cuts continued at major companies like Microsoft, which dramatically downsized its gaming division while laying off…",

We only get one shot at this,\" a goggled Sam Fisher says in a recognizably Metal Gear Solid call screen. We then see a neck-down shot of Solid Snake skulking through a cloud of smoke, unholstering what appears to be a SOCOM pistol with an unusual sight. The man himself doesn't speak, but he appears to be wearing a sneaking suit similar to this MGS2 look. The teaser ends with the date and time of the full Year 11 roadmap reveal: February 15 at 8AM PT. Some obvious questions arise, such as: Huh? Collaborations are nothing new for Rainbow Six where cosmetics are concerned, but this is the first time a playable operator has come from outside the Tom Clancyverse. And what a whopper of a guest character to start off with. It's also totally strange from a lore standpoint—yes, Siege does have an ongoing story told through seasonal animations. Where does Snake fit into all of that? Is he the newest member of Rainbow,…",

You might be curious what's new in this new version, or when it will be out, and I'm sorry to say I can't help. A message posted to the Final Fantasy 7 account on X says \"the original Final Fantasy 7 will be re‑released on Steam to provide an improved gameplay experience,\" and directs readers to an announcement on Steam for \"full details.\" And there definitely are more details, although calling it \"full\" is a stretch. The existing game will be renamed to Final Fantasy 7 - 2013 Edition when the new version launches. Existing owners will have access to both versions, but the original will no longer be available for purchase. Save data will not be compatible: 2013 saves won't work in the new release, and vice versa, so if you want to jump into the new one you'll be starting from scratch. And... that's it. What's changed? When is the update coming? Is the price going up? How's this going to muck up mod support? Why is Square Enix horsing around with a 13-year-old…",

And across all runs, there will now be corrupted regions on the map that you can choose to pass through, facing harder enemies but earning stronger rewards in the process.

With a free demo currently available, I thought there was no harm in checking out this 2D point-and-click puzzle game and having a change in pace. The only reason I was wrong in thinking this is actually because I enjoyed it too much, and suddenly reaching the end of the demo enraged me more than a backstab in Arc Raiders could—I was just starting to get into the puzzle-solving groove. (Image credit: Prism Realm Ltd.) But even if Little Woody's demo may be painfully short, what I played was enough to convince me to wishlist the game and start a countdown for its release. Waking up in an abandoned test facility, you climb out of a broken test tube and stand on your own two feet, as some strange, walking, thinking, sentient tree. There aren't any directions to tell you what to do, but that's the …",

World of Warcraft: Midnight means to carry on this new philosophy, as stated in a roadmap included in a State of Azeroth video posted to Blizzard's official channels today. In it, a post-launch roadmap laid out a step-by-step plan for what players could expect to see after the expansion's launch. First up: Prop hunt. WoW's just getting a prop hunt. No I am not kidding, they are putting a prop hunt in World of Warcraft. I mean, it makes a certain kind of sense—Blizzard's player housing system has been in early access for a while now, meaning hundreds of different assets have been broken off into unique, collectible furniture models. The question you might ask yourself as a developer is, indeed, \"what do we do with all of these moveable assets?\" and the first answer that comes to mind is probably going to be \"prop hunt, I guess?\" (Image credit: Blizzard) While I'm sure it'll be a jolly old…",

Luckily, the Meta Quest 3 I'd been neglecting for the last six months offered a welcoming solution to my problems. I could exercise in the warmth, without having to be sick and generally unpleasant around sweaty strangers. My rubric is simple. I didn't want to overcomplicate the act of just doing some exercise, so I set myself an exercise goal via my smart watch, without signalling to my watch when I was exercising. Instead, I would just let it tally up exercise based on physical exertion. So, if I slacked, I wouldn't finish. To establish some ground rules, I decided this would not be a replacement for traditional exercise, and traditional exercise would not be a replacement for it. I would try to do a minimum of 25 minutes of VR workouts every day, regardless of any other kind of movement I had achieved.

Despite hitting the ground running with the feature, though, Blizzard's keen to keep making improvements. That's per the dev's \"State of Azeroth\" video released today, which you can view below: In it, Blizzard revealed a few key improvements they're working on for player housing—for example, letting your pets run amok indoors, or hitching \"a couple of your favourite mounts up in your yard outdoors\". But the real juice is in expanding the current tools to be even more powerful than they currently are, as director Ion Hazzikostas explains: \"We've also seen and heard that as you're expressing that boundless creativity, and maybe making something like, say, a grand piano that you've cobbled together from a dozen different decor pieces, it can be frustrating when you realise that you have your grand creation, but it's not quite in the spot you want it to be in.\" In t…",

The chip-integrated fibres are said to be as thin as a human hair, and can withstand repeated bending and abrasion, stretching, twisting, and even \"crushing by a container truck weighing 15.6 tons\". Their results have been published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature , and the potential uses for such a thin, bendable, and resilient tech are legion (via SCMP ). Beyond the possibility of creating fabrics where every fibre is its own miniature system, the scientists say that the tech could also be leveraged into brain-computer interfaces. The study into the fabric-like tech was led by Professor Huisheng Peng at Fudan University. The researchers built circuits onto an elastic substrate, before rolling it into a thin, resilient fibre which can function as a complete microcomputer system. \"FICs can process both digital and analogue signals similar to commercial arithmetic chips and perform neural computing with high recognition accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art in-memory image process…",

It still hasn't had quite the breadth of game support as Windows, though, and it's never had native client support for Nvidia GeForce Now (GFN) game streaming—until now, that is, as GFN has officially come to Linux. In beta, at least. Before now, you'd have to either access it via the limited browser version, or use third-party apps, such as GeForce Infinity, but a native Linux client will unlock higher resolutions up to 5K, and higher frame rates, too. I've been trying it out, and it works pretty flawlessly, provided you're on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, have a GPU that supports Vulkan H.264 or H.264 decoding, and are using the correct driver. Unfortunately Ubuntu is the only officially supported distro for now, although Nvidia does want to bring it to further ones and is \"actively evaluating\" them. The company did note that GFN might also currently work on other distros that support Flatpak installation—such as the popular Bazzite distro—but it's only officially recommending Ubuntu for now.

Protagonist Aava is a renown mountain climber with a formidable reputation and reclusive spirit. We meet her at the foot of Mount Kami: an impossibly lofty summit once home to a society of troglodytes with a preference for living vertically. It's her self-assigned mission to be the first to surmount it. What follows is a 15 hour odyssey, or a potentially endless one, about the excruciatingly careful placement of hands and feet on vertical surfaces. It feels grander in scope than anything I've played in recent memory, and it's among the best videogames I've played in years.

I guess Ubi's loosened up since then, because the official Assassin's Creed X account is now posting GTA memes about yet another possible leak. AC fan account Zephryss posted images of a statuette of Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway, writing that it \"might be the new Edward Kenway figurine for the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake\" and had been found by fans on second-hand site Vinted. In response, the AC account posted that old classic: CJ returning to San Andreas with the subtitles \"Ah shit, here we go again.\" For reference, this would be the second time this remake has been leaked by a statue , if genuine.

He says that working on different games and with different teams was \"so much fun,\" but \"when you're a contractor you're constantly looking for the next thing.\" I freelanced for two years, and I never managed to escape that overwhelming feeling that I needed to find more work, so I completely understand why he went back to California and Obsidian. \"I'm not in charge of a project, I'm not a director,\" Cain says. \"You can think of it as more of a consultant.

But amid all of this, there was also a severe DDoS attack , and the new update accidentally introduced a bunch of changes that Embark hadn't planned, and the devs have been trying to put things back to normal ever since. One of these temporary changes affected some firearms in Arc Raiders. \"Following yesterday's update, some weapons were affected by a bug that reduced their rate of fire,\" Embark community manager Ossen says on the official Discord . \"This was not an intentional change. We always aim to include all changes in our patch notes.\" (Image credit: Embark Studios) Unfortunately, it seems like this message wasn't able to permeate all corners of the Arc Raiders community. One player, who took the nerf particularly hard, or maybe just wanted an excuse for some spring cleaning, decided to take the opportunity to recycle all 109 Venators (via Nickmercs ) in their stash, as the gun had been hit particularly hard by the accidental nerf.

Of course, if you got the pricey deluxe edition, then it actually unlocked for you three full days before that time and date, in which case what are you doing here?

That was the case even after Team Ninja apologized for their previous game, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, running like crap on PC . If you cast your mind back five years ago, Nioh 2 also had a less-than-ideal launch. Ninja Gaiden 4 ran decently by all reports, but the settings options left a lot to be desired .

      "body": "Atom Zombie Smasher has been in my Steam account about as long as I've had one. I held out for as long as I could, but eventually games on CD started demanding I install Steam to run them, so I caved and soon after got Portal and a handful of digital-only indie games like Audiosurf, Uplink, and Blendo's zombie tower-defense game. It was basically all over for my free time from then on. Which is why it's wild, more than a decade later, to be reminded of Atom Zombie Smasher's existence by it being patched. This 15th anniversary update isn't going to transform the top-down rescue sim where the zombies are tiny pink squares into The Last of Us 3, but it does add a horde of little changes. For starters, where before you could slow time down to 10%, now you can drop it all the way down to 1%. That's so slow you're basically making Atom Zombie Smasher turn-based, a change I approve of in any tactics game. Also changed: you can deselect units with the Escape key; the seams around cutscene vignette art are gone; and when you're on the Behind the Scenes screen the scroll limit works so you don't scroll too far and end up looking at the game as it would be seen from a passing aeroplane.

Unlike Mr. House, I'm not particularly good at predicting the future, though I'm still holding out hope Mysterious Stranger shows up in the middle of a gunfight in the final episode of the season. In the meantime, Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 let us finally meet a character who's been part of the story for a long, long time, even though we've never seen them before. In the Fallout games this person has been mentioned since Fallout 2, meaning they've been part of Fallout lore for more than 25 years. In the history of the series this character has been critical to world events, yet we've never seen their face, not even in a picture. The show had every chance to continue the tradition by, say, just showing them in silhouette or by obscuring their face, but nope! There they were, on the screen at long last, putting to rest a long-standing mystery about their appearance. Last chance to avoid spoilers! With so much detailed lore about Fallou…",

The update's best new feature, however, isn't mentioned anywhere in all that lovely web design. To find it, you'll have to crawl through some vents. Shortly after the Old Gods update launched, players discovered the Deadlock's updated map had peppered the streets of its necromantic New York with small vents, crawlspaces, and apertures that—while too narrow for most of the roster to traverse—clearly led somewhere. Once Deadlock players selected Rem , a spritely little dream-imp, as their first choice for the update's new character rollout, those nooks and crannies suddenly became much more navigable. \"An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams,\" is an adorable, nightcapped, candle-carrying crow-cat with a suite of sleep-related…",

(Image credit: Bloober Team) There's also a similarly drippy \"play\" button on the page, which if clicked delivers a scratchy message that a quick search reveals is an overwrought recitation of a William Blake poem, The Sick Rose , originally published in 1794 as part of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience collection: O Rose thou art sick.

The biggest thrills you can find in that game are on horseback—galloping across plains, jumping off slopes, and blasting foes off their own horses as you circle each other like sharks. That only happens incidentally, though. At its heart, Highguard is a game about farming Vesper (money but blue) and loot in the open world, then overpowering the enemy team… for the first few minutes of a round, at least. Then it's about competing to grab and escort the Shieldbreaker, sort of like capture the flag. Once that's done, it's about sieging the enemy base; you plant bombs in their fortress, and they try to stop you by putting up reinforced walls, defusing the bombs, and holding out for long enough. By that point you're shuffled into a cramped base where the horse doesn't matter anymore, and you've kind of forgotten why you had one to begin with. The sense I get is that Highguard wants to make a smoothie of the most dominant competitive games' best ingredients—the role-based teamplay and tide-turning ultimate ability spew of a MOBA, the frantic scavenging of a battle royale, the wall-breaching tactics of Rainbow Six, and so on.

Naturally, there was also fresh noise about AI . The Solidaires Informatique union called for a half-day strike at Ubisoft Paris immediately after the restructuring was announced, and warned that move was merely an \"initial response to the absurdity of management decisions.\" Now the union, along with four others—CFE-CGC, CGT, Printemps écologique, and Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo—are taking the next step: A company-wide walkout. \"We are promised autono…",
