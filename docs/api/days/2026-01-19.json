While I could treat myself to a funky, chunky, mains-powered USB hub, I'm kind of longing for something just a little dinkier—and flexible. Enter the DockFrame , a USB-C hub with modular ports you can swap out. Though not officially affiliated, the project is designed to work with the hot-swappable hardware standard used by Framework's expansion cards . A custom PCB is both compatible with any Framework USB-C modules you may have lying around as well as the DockFrame's own 'Tool Cards.' These Tool Cards are a little extra, planning to offer functionality beyond the I/O ports you'd traditionally see on a desktop—such as voltage measuring and even adjustable voltage output. The project remains a ways off, but it's intended to be usable with both Framework laptops, non-Framework machines, and even your smartphone.

    "body": "When Xgimi released the MoGo 4 Laser projector, a little light switched on in my brain. Three, actually. This versatile little tri-laser beamer seeks to follow your lead, and light up your life with a cornucopia of practical portability features. I wouldn't say you're looking at a projector as much as you're looking at a technological druid packing the Wild Shape spell. In all my years of reviewing tech it's become painfully clear that a plentiful feature set usually points to at least a couple of small caveats. No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer. Any piece of tech that can shift from projector, to soundbar, to fancy lightshow with the flick of some far-out mechanism gives me a palpable dopamine hit. That's what Xgimi is pandering to with the MoGo 4 Laser: tech fiends with a penchant for adaptable equipment. At any moment, a swift attachment of one of the…",

VR headsets are becoming fairly popular, but the dream of putting on a headset and seamlessly teleporting to an immerse new world, while my lounge room fades away, is yet to be realised. While modern headsets have come a long way, they either lack the visual fidelity to fool the eyes, the comfort to convince the body, or more likely a bit of both. The Pimax Crystal Super is an example of a headset that does a lot to solve one of these problems, while kinda forgetting about the other. The Pimax Crystal Super boasts some pretty impressive specs, but as such needs a mighty PC to run. Pimax recommends you have at least an RTX 2070 to run the thing, but realistically, if you’re running anything less than a 4080 then you’re not going to scratch the surface of this impressive display. There’s simply no reason to drop the $2,000 on this headset without a high-end PC to power it. You’re far better off grabbing a lower specced VR set-up and upgrading later. You’re also beholden to Pimax’s software, which acts as a driver hub and is required to be configured to play some games li…",

Instead, it's refocusing all its efforts on Vortex , its Windows-only mod manager that first hit alpha all the way back in 2018 (it's fully out now, mind you). Nexus announced the news on its site last week (via GamingOnLinux ), writing that it has stopped making sense—if indeed it ever did—to divide its development efforts between two separate mod managers that aimed to do the same thing (uh, manage mods). \"Instead of moving forward together, we were splitting our focus. Every feature built twice. Every bug fixed in two places. Every conversation about 'which one should I use' was a reminder that we were competing with ourselves instead of solving the actual problems in front of us.\" The short and the tall of it is that \"We're stopping development on the Nexus Mods App and focusing all our efforts on Vortex.\" Which, sure, makes sense. It is an odd move to develop two separate apps that try to do the exact same thing, but the death of the Nexus Mods App means the death of …",

The first murmurings about the feature came in Oct. 2025, when developer ZeniMax Online Studios confirmed to Forbes it was being worked on, and it came up again in a Reddit AMA last week when the studio said that while crossplay is still being developed, it \"won't be a 2026 item.\" In that same thread, though, executive producer Susan Kath confirmed that cross-progression is coming too: \"We will be doing crossplay and cross-prog at the same time,\" she wrote. It's hard to know when to expect the features, though 2027 is the earliest window players might see it. MMOs with both crossplay and cross-progression are exceedingly rare compared to their PC-exclusive or otherwise cordoned-off counterparts, and given what sort of trouble arises squeezing all those players together on a single platform, it's no surprise this sort of thing takes a lot of extra work. The note about cross-progression is great news, though, for anyone looking to explore Tamriel on multiple platforms.

I'll outline the two main options you have to find cobalt early in Hytale so you can craft cobalt gear and start working towards the even more valuable adamantite . Take note that you'll also need shadoweave scraps if you want to craft cobalt items. How to get cobalt in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) You can find cobalt ore in both the Howling Sands desert region and Whisperfrost Frontiers snow-covered area , zones two and three respectively. Cobalt can spawn exposed on the surface and underground , so it's quite a common ore in these regions. I recommend looking out for abandoned mineshafts in particular. These are marked with large wooden structures on the surface and have a large central shaft breaking into various tunnels, and you'll find heaps of cobalt and other precious ores down her…",

How to get shadoweave scraps in Hytale (Image credit: Hypixel) You can get shadoweave scraps from killing Outlander enemies found in Whisperfrost Frontiers, the icy third zone. These barbarians spawn throughout the snowy biomes, but the best way to get shadoweave fast is to raid one of their villages. Once you've found the Whisperfrost Frontiers on your world, open your map and look for large, square settlements . These are Outlander camps, where you'll find multiple of these enemies for you to kill for shadoweave scraps. Here's an example of what Outlander villages look like on the map.

That has now changed: Marathon is coming on March 5. The date was initially revealed by a premature preorder trailer on the Xbox store and while it was quickly pulled, an official announcement rolled out a few hours later. Here's the new trailer: The video is mostly cinematic, a stylish collection of environmental shots, fast cuts, and occasional bits of gunplay: Bungie is definitely going for a vibe here, and this trailer looks like it was built in a lab to drive hype and deliver the climax of a campaign to turn around what was looking like a full-on crisis for Bungie.

    "body": "As the memory supply crisis rages on, manufacturers are continuing to scale up operations in a bid to meet the accelerated demand. The latest memory maker to expand its production line is Micron, which has just signed a letter of intent to acquire Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation’s (PSMC) Tongluo chip foundry in Taiwan. The company's statement to its investors clarifies that this includes an existing 300 mm wafer cleanroom measuring 300,000 square feet, though none of the production equipment contained therein. In total, it's a deal to the tune of $1.8 billion that will encompass more than facilities, with Micron also hoping to establish a long-term business relationship with PSMC. This latest announcement follows recent comments from Micron's VP of Marketing, Christopher Moore, that \" there's just not enough supply to go around .\" However, while this eye-watering transaction is expected to complete during the second quarter of 2026, with Micron assuming control of the fab immediately after, the site isn't expected to contribute meaningfully to DRAM wafer output until the latter half of 2027. Simply put, even with this deal as well as SK Hynix accelerating its own…",

Wonky BIOS files and awkward connectors are easy enough to deal with, but it's a whole different story when it comes to Wi-Fi drivers. That's why Asus' new ROG Crosshair X870E Glacial is noteworthy, because it comes with those drivers pre-installed on the board. It's not the only spangly feature the X870E Glacial has; it's a high-end Asus model, after all. In fact, the mobo sports a veritable smorgasbord of gadgets, extras, and options , all designed to make it as user-friendly as possible. I also have to say that the whole thing really does look very nice. However, one of the last Asus motherboards I reviewed, the TUF Gaming B860M-Plus WiFi , was anything but user-friendly. That's because Asus uses one of three different Wi-Fi modules for this particular model, and there's no way of telling which one you've got without ripping the whole thing apart. That means you have to try three different Wi-Fi driver sets until you hit the right one.

How to get sturdy chitin in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) You can get sturdy chitin from killing the following mobs in the Howling Sands zone , which is the desert biome: Scarak Defender, Fighter, Louse, Seeker, and Broodmother Scorpions Armadillos Tortoises Given that the relatively harmless mobs on the surface, like tortoise, only give one or two sturdy chitin each, your best bet is hunting down Scarak mobs, especially inside their underground nests.

We have to go back in time to a little over a year ago, to when the founder of Amazon was interviewed by Andrew Ross Sorkin at the 2024 New York Times DealBook Summit . At one point, Bezos recalls a time when he was in Luxembourg, visiting a brewery. \"This trip was one of the little tiny catalysts for the founding of AWS (Amazon Web Services, founded 2002), and the brewery was 300 years old. This company [had been] making beer for 300 years … they had a museum, and in that museum was an electric power generator, 100 years old. \"When they wanted to improve the efficiency of their brewery with electricity, there was no power grid, so they had to build their own power station … they made their own electricity, and at that time, that's what everybody did if a hotel wanted electricity: they had their own electric generator.\" Why was he rambling on …",

Depending on when you're reading this, it might've done it already, given the patch launches on January 20. Alright, \"kneecap\" is harsh. Blizzard's made an effort through rounds of beta testing, and continual conversations with addon developers, to try and thread the needle between functionality and form. Basically, the developer doesn't want addons to be required—but anything that's cosmetic can stay . This means obvious things, like roleplay, map, and bag addons are all fine; It also means there's wiggle room in the combat addon sphere for presentation, which is nice for customisability, but it also means that certain accessibility features made by addon creators over the years can be maintained. Or so, Blizzard hopes. This also involves a lot of class redesign.

That's good news for people who love shiny new things, but it's bad news for those who love old things, because when Kiwami 3 releases the remastered version of Yakuza 3 will be harder to buy. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio confirmed as much on Saturday. \"Those who already own Yakuza 3 Remastered will still be able to continue playing it,\" the company posted on X , but \"for those new to the series who wish to experience the original version, it will be available with purchase of the Yakuza Complete Series bundle.\" The Yakuza Complete Series bundle is $130 on Steam when it's not on sale, and it's a pretty good deal if you want, oh, probably around 500 hours worth of Yakuza games. If you want to buy Yakuza 3 Remastered separately it'll set you back $20, though both the bundle and the standalone Yakuza 3 go on sale pretty damn regularly: the latter often goes for around $6.

Viewers expecting something like 2023's Monster Hunter Wilds reveal or the one-two Matrix Unreal Engine 5 tech demo and Matrix 4 trailer in 2021 have been taking out their frustrations on Highguard. The reveal was drowned out by hot takes calling out its \"Concord vibes\" and it received a ghastly 2,400 dislikes on YouTube compared to around 500 likes when it first dropped. There's been an assumption to some of the criticism that Highguard wanted this smoke, so to speak—an idea that if the Highguard studio hadn't splurged on such an exclusive spot, it wouldn't have earned all this ire.

That estimation comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics , which reported that last month saw over 100 million Steam users generate $1.6 billion dollars in gross revenue. That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history. The report explains \"that’s up 22.7% over December 2024 and even more than December 2020’s pandemic-driven high of $1.4 billion.\" The report also notes that Arc Raiders is the second-biggest breadwinner of the season⁠—the first is eternally Counter-Strike 2, as dictated by the laws of physics—with a staggering 1.2 million copies sold just in the weeks between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4.

Developer Re-Logic has set the date for January 27, less than two weeks away. Re-Logic announced the release date earlier this week via a Steam post . \"We have a few more things to get done between now and then,\" the studio wrote on Wednesday. \"But start the countdown because Terraria 1.4.5 will be in your hands in 13 short days!\" While a specific release date has proved elusive up to this point, update 1.4.5 has been nearly finished for some time. Back in August, Re-Logic revealed that it was \"in the endgame\" of development for the update, having defined an internal launch window that it confirmed with various partners. Re-Logic wanted update 1.4.5 to be a global launch concurrent across all platforms, which is partly what has held things up. Indeed, Re-Logic had hoped to release update 1.4.5 in December last year. But in another Steam post published on Boxing Day, it said that this \"wound up being impossible\" as it was \"not possible to get every platform and global partner together in time\". Basically, Re-Logic realis…",

They stole what store owner Courtney Chin estimates is $100,000 in merchandise. The thieves remain at large. Now, I know what you're thinking.

I haven't tried the game myself yet in solo play or otherwise, but seeing a gaggle of heroes take on a huge boss together certainly makes it pop. The game's model for co-op, which was detailed in a lengthy explainer video from Moon Studios in Dec. 2025, is \"similar to how realms work in Minecraft, the only difference being you don't have to pay for a subscription.\" What that means is that rather than Dark Souls invasions, Diablo 4's quasi-MMO open world, or other ARPGs' multiplayer systems where a single player's save file is used, No Rest for the Wicked will distinguish between persistent multiplayer saves and offline single-player saves.

    "body": "More quizzes! (Image credit: Larian Studios, PC Gamer) Want to keep testing your knowledge of gaming trivia? We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. OK, I admit it: I played a ton of XCOM 2 again over the holiday break and now I can't stop thinking about it. In my defence, it's certainly a game that still feels as relevant now as it ever did. People still speculate on a possible XCOM 3 daily online, and the flood of imitators has only gotten bigger the longer the series has remained dormant. Personally I think I'll be waiting with baited breath all year to find out when I can get my hands on cheekily named spiritual successor Star Wars Zero Company . So an XCOM quiz doesn't feel too self-indulgent or out of nowhere… right? I knew it had to be more than just a smattering of trivia, however. PC Gamer's readers are some of the most diehard XCOM fans on the internet—you lot need a real challenge. So here, I've got one for you: do you know the outcome of every single alien autopsy in XCOM 2? For each alien type, you just have to pick out which of the four options is one of the unlocks gained from dissecting it in …",

    "body": "Remember Styx? Cyanide Studios' horrible goblin was the hottest stealth game protagonist of the early 2010s. By this I mean he was the only stealth game protagonist of the early 2010s, as bona-fide sneaking games were vanishingly rare. Then Hitman returned from the dead, and everybody forgot about Styx for a while. But the fast-talking, backstabbing gobbo is returning in a new game in February. To celebrate his reappearance, Epic is giving away the first two Styx games on Steam. From now until January 22 , both Styx: Master of Shadows and Styx: Shards of Darkness are free to keep on Epic. Both games are pretty good sneak-a-thons, worthy of respect simply for how seriously they take stealth. While Styx can technically fight enemies face to face, he is utterly terrible at it and will almost certainly get killed. Hence, evasion, trickery, and shanking guards in the back are the best ways to progress. Master of Shadows set the template for Cyanide, in which Styx embarks on a series of infiltration and assassination missions across extravagant fantasy locations. Indeed, Cynanide deliver some impressively grand environments that let you take advantage of verticality in fun ways. The seq…",

    "body": "Isometric mech sim Brigador is 10 years old this year—a fact that kicked me right in the mortality given that I was certain it only came out a few years ago. The original version of Stellar Jockeys' shoot 'em up was a decent, if flawed affair. But the developer spent the next year overhauling the experience, delivering a new campaign and several other reworks that netted it a much more favourable Steam rating. The sequel, Brigador Killers, has been in development for ages, which surprised me as I assumed it was just Brigador on a larger scale. But Stellar Jockeys recently released some new footage of the game, which shows it is a very different affair from the original, almost like a mix of Syndicate and OG Grand Theft Auto. As it turns out, that isn't far off Stellar Jockeys' own summary of the experience, with the dev having previously described it as \"Hitman: Contracts meets GTA2\". The main difference is that Brigador was a dedicated mech shooter, whereas Brigador Killers lets players explore missions on foot. According to the Steam page , you play as a \"down and out nobody\" who takes it upon themselves to become a one-man army and \"kill some rich pricks who ruined it for the r…",
