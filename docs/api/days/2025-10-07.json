You could colour any game with various hues and douse it in virtual glitter and heart icons, and it would probably pique my interest in some way or another. Lucky for me, Don't Stop, Girlypop! feeds this insatiable need for all things cute and pink while disguised as an action-packed arena shooter, resulting in me feeling brave enough to actually pick up a game from the genre I've sworn to dislike.

That perception dramatically changed, I reckon, around the time of massively multiplayer Curiosity: What's Inside The Cube . It was a game in which, well, a lot of players all tapped on a cube, removing layer after layer until they eventually hit the centre. Molyneux promised the prize for the single player who reached that centre would be \"life-changing\". It turned out to be the role of 'God of gods' in Molyneux's then-upcoming game Godus, plus 1% of the game's revenue. The winner—an 18-year-old named Bryan Henderson—never got any money, and told Eurogamer that he was largely forgotten by Molyneux's studio after a single visit to its office in 2015. Fast forward to today, and an interview with the most recent issue of Edge magazine, and Molyneux seems contrite about the whole saga, but I don't know that he's learnt the right lessons.

The full-spec Panther Lake models, therefore, will reportedly be configured with four Performance cores and eight Efficient cores in the CPU chiplet.

According to this new leak, this new upper tier of Panther Lake chips will be branded Intel Core Ultra X300. So, by way of example, the top chip is said to be the Intel Core Ultra 9 X388H. Arguably the most exciting element of the new chip for PC gaming, however, is the new Xe3-spec iGPU, also known as Celestial. The new \"X\" branded models reportedly get 12 graphics cores.

    "body": "يبدو أن غياب الجناح المصري محمد صلاح عن المساندة الدفاعية بات يشكل \"مشكلة صغيرة\" لفريق ليفربول، خصوصا أمام الفرق الكبرى، في وقت يحاول فيه المدرب آرني سلوت إيجاد التوازن بين حرية \"مو\" الهجومية ومتطلبات المنظومة الدفاعية. ووفقا لهيئة الإذاعة البريطانية \"بي بي سي\"، يعود السبب في ذلك أن صلاح غالبا ما يُمنح حرية البقاء في الخط الأمامي دون العودة للدفاع، ما يجعله من أخطر المهاجمين في العالم خلال لحظات التحول الهجومي، لكنه في المقابل يترك مساحات خلفه يعاني منها الفريق. ويرى التقرير أن اللاعبين الذين يشغلون الجبهة اليمنى خلف صلاح، مثل جيريمي فريمبونج وكونور برادلي ودومينيك سوبوسلاي، يجدون أنفسهم في مواقف صعبة نتيجة تفوق عددي (اثنين ضد واحد) على هذا الجانب. وقد تجلت هذه الثغرة بوضوح في مباراة تشيلسي الأخيرة، التي سجل منها \"البلوز\" هدف الفوز، ما يثير القلق من احتمال استغلال فرق أخرى لهذا الضعف. صلاح يملك حرية التركيز على الجانب الهجومي لا يطلب سلوت من صلاح العودة للخلف ومساعدة الظهير الأيمن، فمن الواضح أن الجناح المصري لا يتتبع لاعبي الخصم كمارك كوكوريّا مثلاً، والمدرب الهولندي لا يبدو من النوع الذي يتساهل في مثل هذه الأمور إن كانت خارجة عن تعليماته. على العكس، يمنح سلوت صلاح حرية التركيز الكامل على الجانب الهجومي دون التزامات دفاعية، وهي فلسفة متبعة لدى عدد من المدربين الذين يفضلون الحفاظ …",

    "body": "Alien Isolation is my favourite horror game, but it's too long and I think that opinion is near unanimous. When it feels like it's drawing to an end it just keeps going , and its protracted runtime is exacerbated by the fact that it's an unbearably tense experience. I adore this game, I swear I do, but boy could it have used a trim. It turns out at least one member of the original dev team agrees. In a conversation with FRVR , Alien Isolation writer Dion Lay demonstrates that the outsize length of the game wasn't deliberate at all: it was because the Xenomorph AI got way too good. In Alien Isolation, the Xenomorph has more sophisticated AI than is still the norm in horror games. Whereas the indestructible stalking characters in Resident Evil tend to always behave the same, the Xenomorph can adapt to player behaviour and is thus a far more formidable opponent. It's why Alien Isolation is still unmatched when it comes to cat-and-mouse style horror, but it also serves to make the player behave more carefully and thus, slowly. In other words: a story that unfolded at a faster clip with less-sophisticated AI became much longer. “The Alien really evolved as we were making it,” Lay said.…",

It's Jurassic Park simulator, in other words, where you try to complete objectives and escape the facility while the deadly T-Rex, the imposing allosaurus, those devious little compsognathus (compies), and of course, the fearsome raptors are nipping at your heels. (Or more accurately, are trying to chew you up and swallow you.) I'm not sure why, but at some point I started assuming Deathground was a bit like Dead By Daylight, and that in addition to playing as humans trying to survive the facility, players could also take on the role of one of the dinosaurs for a bit of asynchronous PvP. I'm not alone in that misconception: it's apparently come up so often that the developers of Deathground put out a FAQ video before the game's early access launch Tuesday to dispel that myth. One of the first questions in the video is \"Can I play as a dinosaur?\" And the answer, unequivocally, is no. \"Deathground is PvE, or player versus environment, so …",

The double XP party is now on until the Blops 7 beta finally concludes on October 9, which just happens to be 24 hours before the global launch of Battlefield 6. Is it a coincidence that the two games keep intersecting like this? I mean yeah, probably—it's a packed fall calendar and you gotta hold your betas sometime—but the short turnaround continues to make these dueling military FPS giants interesting to compare. Take the betas themselves: Battlefield 6 surprised everyone when its open beta peaked at over 500,000 players on Steam alone , marking the \"biggest Battlefield beta ever\" for EA. Activision seems happy with the response to the Black Ops 7 beta so far, but Call of Duty's Steam concurrents didn't crest 100,000 as the beta opened up to everybody on Sunday.

It requires nothing but some precise movement and zero shame for abusing what is a pretty ridiculous glitch. Spoilers below for the second-to-last boss of act 2. Kilroy calls the trick an \"upslash AI break,\" and all it involves is swiping upward with Hornet's needle over and over until you win. For reasons that only Team Cherry would know, this is how you can easily defeat Lace in the second encounter with her near the end of the game. She will simply stand there and take each hit until it's basically over. You won't need any particular crest or tool equipped. Kilroy says the only fiddly part is nudging yourself up just close enough to Lace that you don't take damage. Lace won't move away once you've locked her in place and then all you need to do is quickly line yourself back up when she eventually gets knocked backward …",

The Savage Beastfly could've been worse. A lot worse. And one modder with a far more malicious imagination than the developers stepped in to make that a reality. NexusMods user JngoCreates calls their creation \"Mucked Beastfly\" , and it's essentially the same flying bug we all hate combined with the nasty effects of an area we all hate too. Mucked Beastfly is what happens if you let the Savage Beastfly hang out in Bilewater, the maggot-infested swamp I would've preferred to never think about again. In the room where you normally fight Groal—an already notoriously hard boss—will be a vile version of the Savage Beastfly with new attacks that can infect Hornet, preventing her from being able to heal. Groal is nice enough to leave you a few sturdy platforms to safely land on during the fight. Not the Mucked Beastfly. There are platforms in the boss room but they sink into the pool of maggots after standing on them for a few seconds. JngoCreates also made sure to keep the Savage Beastfly's worst trait and…",

It's good news all around, unless you're one of the many Battlefield 6 beta players who didn't like its new \"Open Weapons\" default—a ruleset that lets any class use any weapon a la Call of Duty. A good chunk of today's blog was a post-mortem on player behavior in the open beta—the result of exactly 92,351,578 total hours played. When comparing Open vs. Closed playlists, DICE says class pick rates were \"mostly identical\" and Closed Weapon (AKA class-locked weapons) matches went on just a tad longer on average, which led to a 2-3% increase in revives. As for weapon usage, \"more players played with non-signature weapons in Open Weapon playlists. However, Recon players still favored Sniper Rifles over other weapons, and their pick rate was identical between both playlist types.\" That lines up with my experience. With open weapons, engineers tended to ditch their signature SMGs for the generally superior…",

It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.\" Darkborn was originally announced in 2016 as Project Wight, but after a grisly gameplay reveal in 2019, the project was effectively cancelled in 2020 . The studio got a new lease on life with the rhythm shooter Metal: Hellsinger , which arrived in 2022 and carries an \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating on Steam.

The game that seems to worry Activision, though? Going by the chat function in Black Ops 7, it's Arc Raiders (due out on October 30). The words \"Arc Raiders\" are censored in Black Ops 7 chat. PCG's Elie Gould tested it out, and when you try to type those words you just get a load of asterisks. Neither \"Arc\" nor \"Raiders\" is picked up like this, only the two words together. Now, there is one kink worth considering here before we all get the pitchforks out. Several months ago users reported a similar problem in the EA App chat . First of all it's surprising that anyone used chat in the EA App, but the situation here was exactly the same. Once this was noticed EA seemed to move quickly to correct the situation, and players could happily chat about Arc Raiders on the EA App from 6 August.

So, it's not a huge surprise to find a former senior Intel manager describing morale as being \"in the toilet.\" But it hits hard, all the same. A new feature on Fortune.com outlines Intel's current problems and provides a glimpse of the huge effort it's going to take to truly turn things around. Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges involves staff, both inside and outside the company. On the one hand, staff inside Intel are said to be demoralised. It's a, “heads-down, push-through situation. That spark in people’s eyes, the desire to do this work, was not there,” said the same former Intel insider of the company's recent predicament. At the same time, attracting new talent to what's seen as a sinking ship is going to be extremely difficult. Intel is no longer the top destination for the \"brightest minds\" in engineering. \"Most people want to be part of a growth story, not a turnaround story,\" another former senior Intel manager is quoted as saying. Fortune notes that Intel's latest CEO Lip Bu Tan has touted new engineering hires as evidence of the progress being made. But that reportedly hasn't landed well inside …",

According to retired Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell (via Earthlink ), roughly two Starlink satellites are burning up in the Earth's atmosphere every day. And that's set to go up. If that all sounds pretty alarming, it's not necessarily a disaster. In fact, it's probably the plan. At the latest count, Starlink has about 8,500 of its low Earth orbit (LEO) comms satellites up there in the inky blackness. Now, because Starlink satellites are in such low orbit, they experience significant drag from the Earth's upper atmosphere. That means the satellites need regular injections of velocity-increasing thrust to stay in orbit. As we'll see in a moment, this is probably a good thing. But one consequence is that the satellites can only stay aloft for a limited period, around five years. Starlink has plans for anywhere from 12,000 to over 40,000 satellites in the long haul.

To deal with this challenge, Mala Petaka incorporates a few modern-shooter gubbins into its GZDoom framework. Most notable is a pseudo-glory-kill mechanic: whittle enemies down enough and you can eventually deliver a quick rat-a-tat of punches that turn them into a fountain of ammo and health chips.

I can't claim all the credit; the Asus ProArt PA401 is a gem. The wood finish down the front panels, the all-black interior, and the clever switches that make it a breeze are all to thank for that. Now I do realise the irony of saying less is more and placing two sticks of G.Skill's finest gold-plated, faux-crystal RAM sticks in there, but they don't look anything near as garish as they sound. This is an all-AMD gaming PC; my slight obsession with using the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in full force here. It's a powerful gaming chip for a reasonable price—3D V-Cache working a treat for improving frame rates.

Battlefield 6 also requires secure boot, much to the chagrin of Linux gamers everywhere. In fairness, gamers are reasonably concerned about giving a company kernel-level access to their machines, which, as our own hardware writer Jacob Ridley put it , \"is like administrator [mode] on steroids\".

Now, you too can experience this unparalleled joy: the latest Humble book bundle is a collection of 54 World of Darkness ebooks (in PDF form) spanning the Vampire, Werewolf, and Hunter series. Mathematics tells us that's quite a lot of books, but economics tells us that, fair play, they're not all that expensive. The entire 57-item bundle (that's the 54 books plus three sets of bonus materials) will set you back $25 (£18.54) . You can nab a cheaper 27-item bundle—which nixes the core rulebooks and several of the newer sourcebooks—is $15 (£11.12) .

Tom's claims that, \"nearly every analyst firm and memory maker is now warning of looming NAND and DRAM shortages that will send SSD and memory prices skyrocketing over the coming months and years, with some even predicting a shortage that will last a decade.\" The reason, inevitably, is explosive demand for AI hardware. Tom's notes that there's some of the usual cyclical variation going on here. Following a downturn in demand in 2022 and 2023 that saw DRAM and NAND memory manufacturers selling chips below cost, manufacturing volumes were scaled back, which eventually fed through into higher prices. But more recently, the insatiable demands of AI for training and inference is requiring vast amounts of storage and memory.

Previous annual expansions have focused on adding new weapon options for each profession, which Cohen notes are \"a lot more specific\" in what they can do for a profession's kit. New elite specs, meanwhile, give ArenaNet a lot more options in what they can pursue. \"When we look at elite specializations, we really try to shift the profession mechanic into something more radical … so that the gameplay is significantly changed.

Millennia, a Civ-like developed by C Prompt Games and published by Paradox last year just received a final update before being consigned to sink into the lone and level sand. When Phil Iwaniuk reviewed Millennia he called it \"rough-edged but worthwhile\", with complaints about its UI and AI and few other things, but praise for its way of handling progress through the ages and \"city improvement tile system.\" It sounded like the kind of game that could be significantly improved by a few additions, and while it did receive several—the final patch is update eight—it doesn't seem like enough was done to elevate it above the competition. \"With this patch,\" the announcement says, \"we are sadly coming to the end of an age. This will be the final patch for Millennia, thanks to C Prompt for their work and support of this game. We at Paradox will no longer be active on community platforms for Millennia, but you can continue counting on us for support needs, and the game will remain available to play indefinitely.\" That announcement highlights …",

Perhaps that's true when you need a game to sell in the tens of millions, but within the same period of time that both Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth have failed to meet the company's lofty expectations, turn-based RPGs in general have been on such a hot streak that they're making their action contemporaries look dusty by comparison. While in Tokyo last week for TGS I played three turn-based RPGs, and I only realized in hindsight that the genre unintentionally represented most of the demo time I was able to squeeze in when not filming interviews for the PC Gaming Show . All three were fun, completely different, and embody the hot streak that turn-based RPGs have been on for at least the last year. I'm specifically thinking of more Japanese-style RPGs, here, though of course if we jump back to 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 turn-based games don't need much defending.

    "body": "A month after launch, Cronos: The New Dawn now has a native Linux build, with devs Bloober Team announcing in a post on Steam , \"Today, we’ve released a native build of the game for Steam’s handheld console, which means even better performance on this platform. Enjoy Cronos on Steam, wherever you are!\" Cronos: The New Dawn was already Deck Verified at launch, but now Steam Deck and Linux players won't have to run the game through a compatibility layer. More and more games are getting native Linux support, largely due to the popularity of the Steam Deck. For instance, Hollow Knight: Silksong had native Linux support at launch last month, while one hero engineer at Larian delivered us a native version of Baldur's Gate 3 . Cronos: The New Dawn joins a growing list of over 42,000 games on Steam with Linux support. At the time of writing, over 9,000 games are Deck Verified. Currently six out of the top ten games on Steam's U.S. Top Sellers list (not including the Steam Deck itself) are either \"Playable\" or \"Verified\" on Steam Deck. Only two have native Linux support, but that's better than none. The September Steam Hardware Survey puts Linux usage at 2.68%, up from 1.92% in September 2…",

I resent having enough of an internet poisoned brain to parse that statement, and wanted to know more. For any normal people with healthy relationships reading this, \"gamer word\" is a sarcastic turn of phrase that emerged out of the fracas of influencer PewDiePie's use of a racial slur in a 2017 PUBG Twitch stream, infamously excused by one defender as a \"heated gaming moment.\" Valve added four new maps to Counter-Strike 2 in an update published October 1 : Transit, Golden, Palacio, and Rooftop. These were community maps made official and put into Counter-Strike 2's rotation by Valve. Two days later on October 3, Valve put out a laconic update with just three changes, one of which was \"Removed Transit from official matchmaking.\" Absent explanation from Valve, we can only speculate, but the most likely culprit is the entity name (how an in-game o…",

I can't even remember the exact circumstances that led me to put 50 hours into a game I'd never heard of before, but its characters, combat, and academic structure really resonated with me. Since then I've come to the conclusion that everyone is secretly a JRPG fan—it's just about finding the right one at the right time in your life. Over the subsequent years I played all four of the Trails of Cold Steel PC ports as they were released, but it always rankled with me that if I wanted to go back to the start of the series (five games earlier) and experience the story from the beginning, I'd have to play a 21-year-old game. There is a 2014 PC port of the original Trails in the Sky , but I'd be losing out on all the combat features added over the years, a whole heap of QoL, and would have to deal with the perspective shift from full 3D to that classic chibi-sprite isometric look that older JRPGs favour. Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter has now been remade, thank the gods, and having spent a week playing the whole thing I can say…",
