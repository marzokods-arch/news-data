Many users expect Calling Cards to be part of the Google Contacts app, but the feature is in the Google Phone app. To address this, Google could soon add a shortcut to Calling Cards in the Contacts app. The company has also been spotted refreshing more parts of the Phone app with Material 3 Expressive.

LaRussell met Hov last month at the Roc Nation offices in Los Angeles, which resulted in the rapper inking a deal with Roc Nation. The 31-year-old partnered with ROC Nation Distribution, while retaining rights to his masters. In a way, LaRussell took both the $500,000 and the meeting with Jay, which has been a nauseating debate on social media for years. &#8220;I got to a point in my journey where I&#8217;m the first in my lineage to do a lot of these things, so I no longer have a guide,&#8221; LaRussell tells Billboard . &#8220;And Hov is who is now another guide for me that I could look to and say, &#8216;Hey, man, how did you navigate this?'&#8221; Doors are already starting to open, as the NFL took note of LaRussell&#8217;s movement, who will be curating the house band for Super Bowl LX at Levi&#8217;s Stadium, and is also slated to perform in Santa Clara on Super Bowl Sunday (Feb. 8) at the Tailgate alongside headliner Teddy Swims.

The international variant of the iPhone 18 Pro could feature a battery capacity ranging between 5,100 and 5,200mAh. This will be higher than the battery capacity expected of the Galaxy S26 Ultra. With the launch of the iPhone 17 Pro last year, Apple flipped the narrative around minimal upgrades to its flagship phones. Even though the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max were only slightly refashioned, the changes were enough to make it the highest-selling phone series of the past quarter. One area where it clearly shone was its impressive battery life. Meanwhile, Samsung has also faced the same criticism but remains in limbo with the same cameras and battery packs, especially on the Ultra, for nearly four generations. With the Galaxy S26 Ultra, the inertia could be more damaging, especially as Apple could surpass the Ultra.

The button didn’t work then, but with the latest Google Wallet v26.5.862583415 release, we now have a better idea of what this “View more” button on the upcoming home screen redesign would do.

Our own benchmarks show that some recent Snapdragon-powered flagship Android phones can run extremely hot. That’s bad news for sustained performance, battery longevity, and comfort. However, a leaker has now made a rather interesting claim about Qualcomm’s solution. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The video shows the design from different angles and reveals the new camera bump. We also see a body-colored S Pen in Cobalt Violet. With just a few weeks to the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series, we’re now approaching the point of marketing material leaking out. After a seemingly official poster emerged earlier in the week, followed by a short-lived listing with multiple colors on a low-profile e-commerce website, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is cropping up again, this time in a bold 360º video. The latest Galaxy S26 Ultra leak comes from leaker Evan Blass on X and flaunts the phone’s different side profiles in Cobalt Violet color. This is also perhaps the clearest, highest-quality leak for the Galaxy S26 series, so much so that it looks like Blass snagged it directly from the top marketing teams at Samsung headquarters.",

We want easy access to our most-used apps. We want to customize it with a personal wallpaper. And a lot of us want to add extra info or functionality with the help of a couple well-placed widgets. But with all of that going on, your screen risks getting a little busy, potentially making useful data harder to spot.

Metals are the materials most commonly used in welding, but it&#8217;s also possible to weld thermoplastics or wood. Welders use their hands, skills, and problem-solving abilities to create something new. At NASA, welders use different types of welding processes to assemble spacecraft and rocket components. Welders also put their expertise to work on equipment and facilities that make space exploration possible, such as launch pads, fuel tanks, propellant lines, and buildings where rockets are assembled. What are the different types of welding? Welding can be done in many different ways. Here are some of the types of welding used at NASA: Arc Welding: Uses electricity to melt metals and fuse them together. There are many types of arc welding, including TIG and MIG welding, described below. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding: Uses a protective gas like argon or helium to keep the metal from reacting with air.

Page Match allows you to seamlessly switch back and forth between a physical book and its audiobook counterpart. Users in the US and UK will soon be able to buy physical books in the Spotify app through Bookshop.org. In January, we discovered through an APK teardown of the Spotify app that a Page Match feature was in development. Spotify has now announced that this book-centric feature will soon be rolling out. On top of this rollout, the company has another update that should also please avid readers. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

During the mission, select crew members will participate in human health studies focused on understanding how astronauts’ bodies adapt to the low-gravity environment of space, including a new study examining subtle changes in blood flow.

An Experience More with Appreciation Savings plan lowers monthly pricing while also reducing trade-in credits. The Loyalty plan is cheaper for large accounts, but cuts data, perks, and long-term price guarantees. T-Mobile isn’t making a big song and dance about it, but it has started offering two new plans designed to keep existing customers from drifting away . The catch is that neither plan is universally available, and because they aren’t advertised, you may not even know they exist unless you ask. Even then, it isn’t clear if they’ll be revealed. As The Mobile Report reports, citing internal T-Mobile sources, the new plans began rolling out today and are limited to certain “segmented” accounts selected by T-Mobile using undisclosed criteria. In short, it sounds like availability depends on who you are, how long you’ve been with T-Mobile, and maybe even which department you end up talking to. The image below shows how these two new plans compare to the standard ones.",

I rather liked the enhanced customization options the keyboard offered me, but I also wanted to gather broader opinions from our community. I conducted a poll asking readers to vote for their preferred Android keyboard app. So, which piece of software won?",

Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26. The feature is likely to be called…",

The senator is concerned that the integration could lead to the exploitation of user data or to manipulating users into paying higher prices. Warren is also concerned that Google could prioritize shopping results from retail partners over competitors. In mid-January, Google announced it collaborated with companies like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair to create a protocol called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) . This protocol would make it easier for AI agents to communicate with retailers for purchases. Along with this protocol, Google also revealed that it would integrate a checkout feature into Gemini, allowing you to make online purchases with the AI. This move has now attracted the attention of one US senator, and for good reason. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A separate leak points to an 8.8-inch 3K 165Hz display, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, and a sole 50MP camera. The device is expected to launch in China around March, but we’re yet to see if and when it will come to other global markets. With the proliferation of specialist handhelds and more powerful gaming phones, compact Android gaming tablets don’t come around very often these days. However, Lenovo is determined not to give up on the idea. The company has now officially teased its next-generation Lenovo Legion Y700, offering a closer look at the device’s design ahead of its expected debut this year. The teasers were shared on Weibo (via NotebookCheck ), where Lenovo posted promotional images showing the tablet in both black and white finishes. In the accompanying text, Lenovo refers to the device as the “Lenovo AI Tablet Legion Y700,” with the AI part feeling almost obligatory in 2026.

One way a number of brands have been doing that is through add-on lenses , but last last year, one phone company teased an even more impressive add-on — and it could soon be ready to make its commercial debut.

Colleague Andrew Grush recently wrote that after using several Samsung foldables over the years, he decided to give up on the form factor . We included a poll in his article to find out your thoughts on foldable phones in 2026. Here’s what you told us!",

New evidence from the IMEI database suggests Samsung is preparing a dedicated variant for the US. The finding follows previous reports that Samsung plans to produce a million units of the Wide Fold, higher than any previous special edition foldable. Apple is bringing its first foldable to the market this year, and other brands are taking notes. The iPhone Fold is set to depart from the accepted book-style design and instead opt for a wider layout, similar to the first Pixel Fold or the Microsoft Surface Duo. Even before the launch of the iPhone Fold, many Android manufacturers were exploring new or additional foldables with similarly wide inner displays, and Samsung is among them . In addition to the Galaxy Z Fold 8 this year, Samsung is expected to launch a “Wide” Fold, and new evidence suggests it might be available in multiple markets worldwide, including the US. The assumption is based on a recent listing of a mysterious Samsung foldable , which was spotted on the IMEI database in December 2025. The said entry has now been updated (via SmartPrix ) with…",

This functionality would enhance location-based queries by allowing users to visually select areas rather than typing place names. “Explore this area,” and similar commands hint at an integration that enables users to discover nearby places with one-tap interactions. One of the biggest advantages of Gemini is its conversational ability . Users can ask questions in natural language and imperfect commands, and Gemini will do its best to return a result. Google built on this advantage by allowing users to attach all sorts of files and media to Gemini to get even better, more personalized answers. Soon, Gemini could allow users to attach a map region to their prompt, opening the door for Gemini to become your personal travel guide.

While these may be the initial applications, we could see more, as previewed by Google in its Project Astra demo last year. Google could refer to the functionality as “screen automation.” AI agents are the hottest trend in tech , and the increasing momentum leaves no room for doubting that your mobile devices will soon be controlled by them. Back at I/O 2025, Google demonstrated how it plans to put Gemini in charge of controlling your phone for you. This was dubbed Project Astra and showed Gemini’s capabilities at not just viewing the text and media on your phone, but also scrolling and tapping when needed, basically displaying a spectrum of agentic force in action to help you with simple tasks.
