Big updates for Stardew Valley are typically years apart, and though it feels like we just got the last major patch yesterday, version 1.6 launched in March 2024.

But with GDC now just a month away, there's bad news for the conference and everyone hoping to hear what he had to say, because he's not going to be there. Word of the last-minute withdrawal came from the Kojima Productions X account: (Image credit: Kojima Productions (Twitter)) \"We regret to inform you that Hideo Kojima will no longer be able to attend this year's GDC Festival of Gaming,\" the message says. \"We understand that this will be disappointing for fans and attendees who were looking forward to hearing him speak, and we want to offer our deepest apologies.

People will glom onto anything and everything that seems to be even tangentially related to Half-Life 3, and the latest rumour doing the rounds was no exception. The Valve fan account GabeFollower posted a new YouTube video claiming that this time it was actually, definitely happening, including a claim that the project is so done-and-dusted that Valve had begun moving its devs onto other projects. So far, so Sunday morning, though for whatever reason this claim was picked up and reported on by several outlets. Now: any games developer reading the above is probably laughing themselves silly. This is an over-simplification but games have so many moving parts that the final stages of development are where the whole project starts coming together.

The last ten years of Overwatch have certainly been a tumultuous ride, but I've stayed on nevertheless, because throughout it all, I always had confidence in Team 4 that they could learn from mistakes and put their best foot forward. And they have done, not only during the latest Overwatch spotlight , which blew everyone away, myself included, but multiple points over the last few years. The introduction of perks and Stadium last year, alongside map voting and hero bans , was massive for the game. Somehow Stadium manages to feel like an entirely different beast while also being approachable enough for Overwatch players to just pick up whenever, with even more changes coming soon to help its accessibility. Perks may have seemed like a small enough change, but they actually have a huge impact on how fights unfold in Overwatch.

Oh, and they can explode, making them a risk when left next to your bed or in an unmanned part of a plane, so that's not ideal. Luckily, a new breakthrough means we may be able to move on from them. Enter sodium-ion batteries. As reported by Live Science , a new experiment performed by researchers at the Tokyo University of Science has yielded promising results. Lithium-ion batteries work by using a graphite cathode to store the charged lithium ions—this is what actually causes your battery to be charged. Sodium ions need hard carbon instead, and previously, it was found that the sodium ions got jammed when trying to flow into the porous material.

That key can then be used to decrypt files. It's like someone who spots you removing your lock from a locker and putting theirs on instead. Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back.

Imagine my disappointment. And now, as of the most recent Steam beta update, there's even less Linux weirdness to deal with when you slip free of the shackles of Windows.

The big tentpole additions are a new raid quickplay option and a major wardrobe update, the latter introducing a fashion template system that, on paper, lets players quickly and easily change their looks. This is the first major update of the Visions of Eternity expansion cycle, one that—in a tweak to how previous annual expansions worked—features very little in the way of new stuff . Due to complaints around how limited the updates were in previous expansions, ArenaNet is saving new maps and story chapters to the second and third major updates. This one, then, is all about the quality-of-life additions. So how much quality of life have these two new features actually brought?

Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed.

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules. As the memory supply crisis went further and further into the red, it became clear that a VRAM-stuffed Super refresh in the coming months was unlikely. The RTX 50-series cards we've tested to da…",

If this is your first miHoYo livestream, it usually runs one every six weeks for each of its games, giving an overview of the characters, events, and quests coming in the latest update. And as a little bonus for tuning in, it drops a few codes that you can redeem to add some extra Stellar Jade to your hoard. If leaks are to be believed, we've got five-star Elation characters Yao Guang and Sparxie on the way, plus more to come in the subsequent Planarcadia updates, similar to how Penacony and Amphoreus gradually released theirs. I'll add each code as it drops during the dream, but make sure to redeem them as soon as possible if you want them, since livestream codes usually expire within a day or so.

And if it can, can HBO and Mazin be trusted to do it justice? Well, depends who you ask. For instance, if you ask Larian CEO Swen Vincke, the future seems pretty bright, all things considered. In a post on X , Vincke said that \"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures,\" so a series that builds on them makes perfect sense. Even more promising, despite Larian having no official involvement with the series, Mazin and co are apparently in touch with the studio: \"Craig did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us,\" wrote Vincke. \"From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope.\" Hooray!

But don't worry, I'll go over all the best places to look for Cooling Coils below so you can move on to the next step. Where to find Cooling Coils in Arc Raiders Embark Embark You have a higher chance of finding Cooling Coils inside Industrial areas, where they often spawn in red lockers, breachable crates, and tool boxes. In my experience, the best place to look for Cooling Coil are on Dam Battlegrounds: Hydroponic Dome Complex Water Treatment Control Power Generation Complex on Dam Battlegrounds There are plenty of the container types you're looking for inside these areas, so hopefully you get lucky.

But it's not all just about emotional character arcs—let's put our main characters' progress into cold, hard numbers, or levels, to be exact. Spoilers ahead for Fallout season 2 At the end of the first season, the levels for each of our main characters were slightly skewed, or at least not where you'd expect them to be. Despite being the main character, Lucy only managed to get to level 8, while The Ghoul sat somewhere around level 89, and Maximus managed to reach level 9. Thaddeus also somehow managed to reach level 50 after accidentally turning himself into a Ghoul (more on that later). So, to wrap up season 2, I've decided to take stock of everything our main characters (plus Norm and Hank) got up to over the course of the eight episodes and see whether they managed to get more or less XP this season. But I'll let you know now, it's not looking good for most of them.

Aside from The Last of Us, Mazin is known for HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, as well as a handful of comedy films, including a couple of the Scary Movie parodies and the second two Hangover movies. According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3. The original BioWare RPGs are \"not official source material,\" the site says, but the show can use material from D&D's Forgotten Realms setting in general.

So much so that I barely used the warrior early on in favour of the ninja, where I simply overwhelmed the enemy with a flurry of attacks and dodged here, there, and everywhere. The Ki Pulse is how samurai manage their stamina, requiring you to press the right bumper on a controller at the correct time during combos to recover Ki. It's a lot to keep track of, and it doesn't lead to very smooth, impactful samurai combat if you can't do it right. Plus, I'm a sucker for odachis—large, Ki-eating swords—so I was burning through stamina after just a few hits, leaving me defenceless. One early item that really helped me is the Running Water skill , which lets you perform a Ki Pulse by dodging. It's as simple as it sounds, but it's another way to get your stamina back after a combo while also evading att…",

Not only is Jakotsu-baba a real pain by himself, but he's also inside the Crucible—basically a nightmare realm, where any damage you take also decreases your maximum health.

Unlike Sekiro, the parry in Nioh 3 is purely defensive in that it doesn't damage enemy Ki (stamina) so it never leads to a stagger and a Grapple attack. It does, however, give you Ki regen and Arts ability energy, letting you be aggressive and deal more damage. It's also more efficient than regular blocking purely in terms of Ki cost If you want to unlock this Samurai ability, you can actually do it almost immediately—in fact, it can be the very first skill you unlock.

    "body": "For many who played so much Arc Raiders that the only thing left to do was wipe their progress and start over, that last Expedition didn't quite hit the mark. \"Honestly, it wasn't worth it\" argued our own Sean Martin upon completion. The requirements were a grind and the rewards only so-so. So, Embark is doing things a little differently for its second Expedition project that departs on March 1. \"Starting off, we want to get one announcement out of the way right off the bat: we’ve heard your feedback about the required Stash value for maximum rewards being too high, and have decided to lower the requirement to three million Coins (600k per Skill Point),\" Embark wrote in blog post published today. \"The reward will still be five skill points for reaching the three million stash value.\" That's a big discount from the five million Coins that were needed to get the full skill point bonuses in the first Expedition—or a million coins per point. Yowza, now I understand the hate. To make amends with folks who tried and failed to complete the Expedition last time, Embark is also introducing a \"catchup mechanic\" that will allow players to earn last season's five skill points on the cheap: (I…",

On one hand, it's not surprising that Overwatch would introduce a cat hero. The shooter has a couple animal heroes already: Winston, a super-intelligent gorilla, and Wrecking Ball, a mech piloted by a hamster named Hammond. On the other hand, as Reddit user mikoga points out , those heroes are protected by powerful mechanized armor. Jetpack Cat is 90% just-a-cat. \"I don't want to shoot at a normal ass cat,\" mikoga said. I hadn't really considered it before seeing that comment, but I might also not want to shoot at a normal ass cat, although there are some compelling rebuttals in the thread. Hammond may be protected by a mech suit, notes one commenter, but his little hamster body sometimes spills out of the cockpit when he's eliminated. The mech also explodes a fair bit, as I recall. That does make it hard to claim that Jetpack Cat is an aberration: Overwatch has been annihilating furballs for some time now. Other arguments boil down to 'you won't feel bad once she's annoying the hell out of you.' Jetpack Cat …",
