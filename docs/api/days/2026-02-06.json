In the case of Intel, the Chinese market alone is said to account for 20% of its overall revenue. Reuters' sources say that Intel currently has a substantial backlog of unfulfilled orders for its fourth and fifth-generation Xeon server chips, and that the company is currently rationing deliveries. In a statement to the outlet, Intel said that the rapid adoption of AI had led to strong demands for \"traditional compute\", and that the company expects \"inventory at [its] lowest level in Q1, but we are addressing aggressively and expect supply improvement in Q2 through 2026.\" While AI is driving such heavy demand for all sorts of computing components, chip manufacturers appear to be struggling to keep up.

At least, that's what ransomware is supposed to be. Recently, a new one has been spotted that couldn't be removed even if the hackers wanted to. Nitrogen's ESXi ransomware, as spotted by Coveware (via The Register ), has a \"coding mistake in the ESXi malware [that] causes it to encrypt all the files with the wrong public key, irrevocably corrupting them.\" Effectively, once ransomware gets into your device (often via suspicious links or PC vulnerabilities), it then encrypts your valuable files and stores a randomly generated key that only it knows. That key can then be used to decrypt files. It's like someone who spots you removing your lock from a locker and putting theirs on instead. Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back. Coveware points out that when the public key is accessed, the ransomware mistakenly overwrites the first four bytes of the key, which means \"no one actually knows the private key that goes with the corrupted public key.\"…",

For example, I only got three skill points when I reset last time, but instead of $2 million, I now only have to pay $600k for the remaining two. In fact, $2 million would get me those old skill points and two of the second Expedition ones as well. While I think the old system was fine, it definitely makes those bonuses easier to claim for everyone involved, which is a good thing when we're taking the time to complete the project and offer up our loot-filled stashes.

How to emote in Nioh 3 (Image credit: Team Ninja) You can emote in Nioh 3 by pressing the right bumper and the start button on controller, or 'G' on keyboard. This will open the gesture window where you can pick from a bunch of different gestures (there are multiple pages, so no doubt an emote for every mood). Select your emote, and your character will bust a move. If you're wondering why the emotes are colour-coded, that'll come in handy for dealing with Nurikabe yokai.

Balatro (Image credit: LocalThunk) Entering a new year, everyone has their list of most hotly anticipated games (here's ours ), but Balatro is the perfect example of a Cinderella story that comes out of nowhere. A single developer tinkering around, trying to learn how to build a game, resulted in a smash hit that won Best Indie Game and was nominated for Ultimate Game of the Year in 2024's Golden Joystick Awards . This roguelike deckbuilder tasks you with racking up absurdly high point totals by whatever means necessary, whether that's filling your hand with multiples of the same card or using special math powers conferred on you by your collection of Jokers.

Imagine my disappointment. And now, as of the most recent Steam beta update, there's even less Linux weirdness to deal with when you slip free of the shackles of Windows. As of yesterday's Steam (and Steam Deck) client beta update , Valve has put paid to a bug that meant the platform would sometimes forget it can run Windows games on Linux. Cut it some slack; it's 23 years old. The bug in question afflicted users with especially large libraries—though Valve doesn't say how large—and would \"result in Proton games showing up as 'Not valid on current platform'\".

This is the first major update of the Visions of Eternity expansion cycle, one that—in a tweak to how previous annual expansions worked—features very little in the way of new stuff . Due to complaints around how limited the updates were in previous expansions, ArenaNet is saving new maps and story chapters to the second and third major updates.

I know that for many gamers, it delivered the hyperfast bullet ballet they'd always wanted, but for me, it simply felt that far too much of Doom's DNA had been sacrificed in order to deliver it. Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed. A more grounded (literally) take on the classic FPS formula that, to me at least, felt far more like a spiritual successor to the legendary 1993 original. And now, thanks to id Software's 35th anniversary celebrations, Doom: The Dark Ages is over two-thirds off.

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules. As the memory supply crisis went further and further into the red, it became clear that a VRAM-stuffed Super refresh in the coming months was unlikely. The RTX 50-series cards we've tested to da…",

In a post on X , Vincke said that \"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures,\" so a series that builds on them makes perfect sense. Even more promising, despite Larian having no official involvement with the series, Mazin and co are apparently in touch with the studio: \"Craig did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us,\" wrote Vincke. \"From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope.\" Hooray!

Annoyingly, now you need to find four of the buggers to complete the second stage of your second Expedition Project. Of course, when you need a bunch of a certain item, you can't find any at all. But don't worry, I'll go over all the best places to look for Cooling Coils below so you can move on to the next step. Where to find Cooling Coils in Arc Raiders Embark Embark You have a higher chance of finding Cooling Coils inside Industrial areas, where they often spawn in red lockers, breachable crates, and tool boxes. In my experience, the best place to look for Cooling Coil are on Dam Battlegrounds: Hydroponic Dome Complex Water Treatment Control Power Generation Complex on Dam Battlegrounds There are plenty of the container types you're looking for inside these areas, so hopefully you get lucky. (Image credit: Embark) While I much prefer searching Dam Battlegrounds for Cooling Coil, especially the compact Hydroponic Dome Complex, there are also plenty of Industrial areas on the Spaceport map. …",

    "body": "Amazon's Fallout TV show season 2 has come to a close. Some loose ends were tied up, and more were teased , ready for season 3, which will start filming in the summer . But it's not all just about emotional character arcs—let's put our main characters' progress into cold, hard numbers, or levels, to be exact. Spoilers ahead for Fallout season 2 At the end of the first season, the levels for each of our main characters were slightly skewed, or at least not where you'd expect them to be. Despite being the main character, Lucy only managed to get to level 8, while The Ghoul sat somewhere around level 89, and Maximus managed to reach level 9. Thaddeus also somehow managed to reach level 50 after accidentally turning himself into a Ghoul (more on that later). So, to wrap up season 2, I've decided to take stock of everything our main characters (plus Norm and Hank) got up to over the course of the eight episodes and see whether they managed to get more or less XP this season. But I'll let you know now, it's not looking good for most of them. The Methodology (Image credit: Prime Video) I used the same method as I did in my previous article, where I calculated the levels at the end of sea…",

Aside from The Last of Us, Mazin is known for HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, as well as a handful of comedy films, including a couple of the Scary Movie parodies and the second two Hangover movies. According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3.

How to increase your skill capacity in Nioh 3 Team Ninja Team Ninja Team Ninja You can increase your skill capacity in Nioh 3 by finding texts or memorandums through trading with Sudama, reaching exploration milestones in each region, and as rewards for activities , such as valuable chests. Texts increase their respective skill capacity by one, while you'll need four memorandums of the same type before they'll add an extra point. Here are a few universal, samurai, and ninja texts you can find early on: Text locations Type Location Warrior's Text In a small chest in the friendly camp just north of Hamamatsu Gate in…",

I swear, I spend 30 minutes designing a character and someone completely different wanders out. Since Nioh 3 has a character code system, you can share your character creations with others, or yoink the very pretty ones strangers have spent hours handcrafting—all you need is a code. Below I'll explain how to change appearance and also use and share these character codes in case you want something premade.

In particular, Burst Break is of huge importance in this fight, so I hope you've been paying attention—jokes, I'll explain how to use Burst Break down below. I'll also offer some other tips for triumphing against this spear-wielding Takeda clan warrior. After you beat Masakage, you'll complete the prologue section, and be able to enter the rest of the game for real. How to beat Yamagata Masakage in Nioh 3 Though not all that tricky, Yamagata Masakage definitely requires you to adjust to Nioh 3's combat style, in particular, the Burst Break mechanic. Using Burst Break with R (RT on controller), when Yamagata flashes red, will deal big Ki damage (the blue bar below his health), making it easier to stun him and press Y to perform a Grapple that will take a chunk of his health away. Burst Break will also change you from Ninja to Samurai or vice versa, though you can tweak this. This attack is easy to recognise since he'…",

When moving in for an attack, weapons are laid down in favor of Ekon’s deadly bite attack, which will dash forward and bite a prey before immediately transforming back to human form to finish off the job. Attacking without a target will allow Ekon to perform a small air dash to traverse maps more athletically.

The requirements were a grind and the rewards only so-so. So, Embark is doing things a little differently for its second Expedition project that departs on March 1. \"Starting off, we want to get one announcement out of the way right off the bat: we’ve heard your feedback about the required Stash value for maximum rewards being too high, and have decided to lower the requirement to three million Coins (600k per Skill Point),\" Embark wrote in blog post published today. \"The reward will still be five skill points for reaching the three million stash value.\" That's a big discount from the five million Coins that were needed to get the full skill point bonuses in the first Expedition—or a million coins per point. Yowza, now I understand the hate. To make amends with folks who tried and failed to complete the Expedition last time, Embark is also introducing a \"catchup mechanic\" that will allow players to earn last season's five skill points on the cheap: (I…",

The shooter has a couple animal heroes already: Winston, a super-intelligent gorilla, and Wrecking Ball, a mech piloted by a hamster named Hammond. On the other hand, as Reddit user mikoga points out , those heroes are protected by powerful mechanized armor. Jetpack Cat is 90% just-a-cat. \"I don't want to shoot at a normal ass cat,\" mikoga said. I hadn't really considered it before seeing that comment, but I might also not want to shoot at a normal ass cat, although there are some compelling rebuttals in the thread. Hammond may be protected by a mech suit, notes one commenter, but his little hamster body sometimes spills out of the cockpit when he's eliminated. The mech also explodes a fair bit, as I recall. That does make it hard to claim that Jetpack Cat is an aberration: Overwatch has been annihilating furballs for some time now. Other arguments boil down to 'you won't feel bad once she's annoying the hell out of you.' Jetpack Cat …",

This interesting spot of trivia came out of a recent Game Business interview with World of Warcraft vice president and executive producer Holly Longdale and game director Ion Hazzikostas (via GamesRadar ), in which Longdale expressed a desire to do more with Warcraft, beginning with broadening its appeal. \"It’s a fantastic IP,\" Longdale sale. \"In my humble opinion, it’s been underutilized and I just want to bring it to as many people as possible.

Fortunately, it all paid off in the end, because now 60+ workers are covered by the new agreement and it offers them a number of significant benefits. A statement provided by the Communications Workers of America—the union that represents the workers—confirms that the QA staff will have guaranteed wage increases; more regulations on AI and generative AI usage at work to ensure workers are supported, not replaced; protections on fair crediting; disability accommodations; immigrant worker protection; and restrictions on \"mandatory 'crunch time' or excessive overtime hours.\" All in all, this is…",

The world's most headline-friendly cryptocurrency dropped in value below $70,000 per coin on Thursday for the first time since 2024, with its losses overall this year totalling more than 20 percent. The reasons why are complicated, but famous hedge fund manager Michael Burry has some ideas. You know, the guy portrayed by Christian Bale in 2015's The Big Short . Burry took to his paid subscriber Substack page to declare that crypto was experiencing a \"collateral death spiral\", thanks to \"sky high leverage\" on crypto exchanges due to rising metal prices, which in turn meant that \"as the crypto collateral fell, the tokenized metals had to be sold\" (via Coindesk ). To understand what's happening here, I need to explain tokenised metals , so strap in. According to information I learned this morning (I have so little interest in crypto it's physically painful), tokenised metals are essentially blockchain representations of assets like gold, platinum and silver. They can be full asset-backed tokens, …",

Roman Hartung who fronts the der8auer channel is also CEO of PC cooling specialist Thermal Grizzly. In that capacity, he's directly involved in buying 12 mm thick copper plates which are used via CNC manufacturing to produce items such as water cooling blocks for graphics cards. Hartung says he attempted to make a routine order for the plates back in October. Normally, the copper plates are shipped out within a few weeks of placing an order. But this time, he was told a price couldn't be confirmed and delivery would not be possible until February. Another supplier said they could deliver plates, but at a 40% higher price than before. Thermal Grizzly was paying around 190 euros per plate last year, with each plate enough to make four RTX 5080 GPU water cooling blocks. Today, he says the company would have to pay 280 euros per plate, potentially making the cooling block product non-viable. Hartung points out that in terms of market commodity pricing, copper has increased from $9,000 per tonne a year ago to an all-time…",

Put your shades on so you don't damage your eyes when you bear witness to all the unannounced PC games, interviews with passionate developers, and updates on the videogames already at the top of your wishlist. Of course, there will also be banter between our hosts, deep dives that take you behind the scenes of some of our most hotly anticipated games, and more world premieres than you can shake a stick at. Please don't actually shake any sticks at them, though, they're skittish. In the crowded sea of summer showcases, the PC Gaming Show stands out from the pack as the only one made by PC Gamers, for PC gamers. FPS, RPG, RTS, any acronym you can think of, there will probably be a game of that genre in our line-up. And if there isn't, you can send a pigeon to our complaints department. If you're a developer who wants a chance to show off an upcoming game, hit up Editorial Director Jake Tucker (jake.tucker@futurenet.com) and VP of Gaming Melissa Makhmaltchi (melissa.makhmaltchi@futurenet.com).
