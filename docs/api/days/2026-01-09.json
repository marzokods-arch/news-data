The small satellite is now awaiting instrument calibration following a successful integration in Canada and rigorous testing by engineers at the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. StarBurst is designed to detect the initial emission of short gamma-ray bursts, some of the most powerful explosions in the universe and a key indicator of neutron star mergers. This would provide valuable insight into such events, which are also detected through gravitational waves by observatories on Earth. These events are where most of the heavy metals in the universe, such as gold and platinum, are formed. To date, only one such event has been observed simultaneously in gravitational waves and gamma-rays; StarBurst is expected to find up to 10 per year. StarBurst arrived at NASA Marshall in March 2025.

Fronti, one of Puerto Rico’s rising voices in música urbana, enlists superstar Ozuna for the remix of his track “Un Kiss,” originally featured on his 2025 album El Diamond . While the original, produced by Dime Ecua and Arkey-O, showcased Fronti&#8217;s streetwise charisma, the remix amplifies the energy with Ozuna’s sly hooks. Backed by sleek trap production from RKO, the song finds Fronti spitting blunt verses about unfiltered desire, while Ozuna’s pre-chorus and hook add a playful yet polished contrast. “ Dale, bebé, dame un kiss pa&#8217; que lubri, vamo’ a romper la ley, ” Ozuna croons.

A new leak reveals that a Privacy Display card does appear in the Tips app for the Galaxy S26 Plus. The card appears to include the same animations and descriptive text as the one found on the spoofed S26 Ultra. When you’re out in public, the last thing you want is for nosy strangers to be looking at what you’re doing on your phone. Last year, we spotted code within a leaked build of One UI 8.5 that suggested Samsung was working on a solution for this problem, called Privacy Display. There have since been plenty of leaks suggesting that this will be a Galaxy S26 Ultra feature. But what about the other models in the series? A new leak may have revealed the answer to that question. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR The December Nothing OS update removes Lock Glimpse from Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro. Nothing Phone 3a Lite still has Lock Glimpse installed, but it can be disabled. Nothing says a future update will let Phone 3a Lite users uninstall Lock Glimpse. Nothing phones started getting Android 16 with the rollout of Nothing OS 4.0 in November . On Nothing Phone 3a, 3a Pro , and 3a Lite, the update included a feature called Lock Glimpse, a widely panned addition that served ads on those phones’ lock screens. Now, Nothing has announced that it’s bowing to user pressure and removing the feature — at least on the 3a and 3a Pro. Lock Glimpse has always been an optional feature, technically — 3a series phones on Nothing OS 4.0 present the option to disable it. That solution wasn’t satisfactory, though, as users found the software was draining their batteries even when turned off . Today, Nothing shared that the feature is being removed from the 3a series (except the 3a Lite) as of the Nothing OS 4.0 December update.",

Honor officially launched the Honor Magic 8 Pro and Magic 8 Lite in the UK this week, with the former being a true flagship and the latter striking a more affordable price point. The Honor Magic 8 Pro brings impressive specs such as a 200MP telephoto camera, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset , and a 6,270mAh battery capacity. However, Honor is already gearing up to launch another Magic 8 Pro variant, and it now has an official launch date. Recent teasers and rumors pointed toward Honor launching an ultra-slim version of the Magic 8 Pro, and the company confirmed in a Weibo post that this device will launch later this month as the Magic 8 Pro Air. The handset will be revealed on January 19 in China, which is less than two weeks away.

    "body": "TL;DR Meta is rolling out its conversation focus smart glasses feature in early access. Conversation focus is meant to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to to make conversation easier in noisy environments. The feature is available to try on Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN glasses. Most smart glasses aren’t explicitly made to be accessibility tools, but it’s easy to imagine ways they could be used to that end. Take Meta’s conversation focus, which uses smart glasses’ built-in speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to in noisy environments. The feature was announced months ago, but now, it’s rolling out in a limited test. Meta announced its conversation focus feature at the company’s Connect event in September, and users have been able to sign up for a waitlist to try it since December. UploadVR spotted today that the feature is actually making its way to users who’ve signed up for Meta’s Early Access program.",

Health/fitness brand Amazfit has two such concept devices at CES 2026 — the V1TAL Food Camera and Helio Smart Glasses — and I had the opportunity to try both. The V1TAL is easily the most polarizing of the two, so let’s start there. I saw the V1TAL behind closed doors at last year’s CES, but this was the first time I could photograph it and see it more thoroughly. As for what it is, it’s exactly as I describe in the headline: an AI camera that watches you while you eat.",

We now have our first visual proof that Perplexity AI is Bixby’s new brain. A new Bixby Live interface hints at real-time AI conversations, mirroring Gemini Live capabilities. Samsung’s Bixby has spent the better part of the decade being the assistant we love to disable, but the new One UI 8.5 update could make that decision harder. Rather than competing directly with Google Gemini, Samsung is reportedly following Apple’s lead by bringing in stronger AI support . We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ). In these images, Bixby sends complex questions to Perplexity instead of using its own limited knowledge. The responses look more like well-researched answers, complete with citations.",

We can build incredibly fast chips, but run them too fast, and they’re going to start to melt down. As a result, nearly every device we use has to make some sort of balance between performance and thermal emissions.

It’s expected to launch in 2026 and will adopt a wider aspect ratio than most book-style foldables, so the iPhone unfolds into a layout somewhat similar to that of an iPad Mini. And one of its priorities is likely to build a folding inner screen without a visible crease. In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands. Based on a rumor shared by a Weibo account with the username “Fixed-focus digital cameras ,” Apple tore apart an OPPO Find N5 while trying to decode what enables the screen’s crease to be so minimal.",

    "body": "TL;DR We’ve managed to enable the upcoming “My Calling Card” feature in Google’s Phone app. You can now create your own Calling Card, choose a photo, customize fonts, and control who sees it. If someone hasn’t customized your card already, they’ll see your version when you call. Google introduced Calling Cards for Android last year. Just like iOS, Calling Card on Android lets you customize how incoming calls from friends and family appear on your phone. It’s a great feature, but has been lacking something big Apple offers with Contact Posters on iPhones since the feature came around. While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation. We found that Google is working on a new “My calling card” option inside the Phone by Google app to allow you to set up your own Calling Card that would appear for other users when you call them. At the time, the setting existed, but it didn’t actually do anything. Now, we can show you exactly how you’ll be able to set up your own calling card.",

Unsurprisingly, T-Mobile has clarified plans to appeal the decisions it disagrees with. It’s no secret that AT&amp;T and T-Mobile’s rivalry has intensified significantly over the last half year or so. AT&amp;T not only unveiled an ad campaign around T-Mobile’s so-called Un-Truths late last year, but it also sued its rival over T-Mobile’s new Switching tool, and it even brought complaints of false advertising to the National Advertising Division (NAD).

Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.

Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees.

At CES, Aurzen is showcasing the cream of its projector lineup, with an emphasis on compact designs and use cases that go well beyond the living room. The company’s presence at the show centres on three product families: the ZIP Cyber Edition, the BOOM series, and a new range of Roku TV–powered smart projectors. Together, they frame Aurzen’s view of portable projection as something flexible enough for travel, cars, and casual home setups.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Hindy / Android Authority TL;DR Google Play Store is working on a “Try before you buy” feature that allows users to play premium games for a set duration at no cost. Users can purchase the full game experience once their trial ends, and their progress will be carried over. The feature is likely to be an opt-in tool for game developers, helping them attract users who are hesitant about upfront costs. The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it. Google may be looking to address this issue, as the Play Store could soon offer a new “Try before you buy” feature for premium games.

It has said that it only delivers software after testing, refuting Google’s plan to split updates into crucial and optional updates. However, it has said that it will resume updates in January 2026. In 2019, Google set out to split Android updates into two parts, so it could deliver crucial features directly to users without needing manufacturers to first adapt them to their custom skins. These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section.
