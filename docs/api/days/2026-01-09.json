    "body": "Intel went on record at CES about a planned version of its new Panther Lake chip specifically configured for handheld gaming PCs but didn't provide any details. Now Videocardz claims the chip will be branded \"Intel Core G3 Extreme\" and have the same iGPU as Panther Lake in laptops. That means the Core G3 will get the same 12 Xe3-spec graphics cores as the top-spec Panther Lake chips for laptops. However, the leak claims that some concessions have been made to squeeze Panther Lake into the handheld form factor. On the iGPU side, it's said that clock speeds have been reduced from the 2.5 GHz of laptop chips like the Core Ultra X9 388H to 2.3 GHz. No doubt the idea is to reduce power consumption without noticeably impacting frame rates. That slight reduction in clock speed has apparently been enough to have Intel rebrand the iGPU from Intel Arc B390 in the top laptop variants of Panther Lake to Intel Arc B380 for the Intel Core G3 Extreme. As for the CPU of the Panther Lake package, that's had a bit more of a haircut. The full-spec Panther Lake configuration in the aforementioned Core Ultra X9 388H has four Performance cores, eight Efficient cores and four Low Power Efficient cores. …",

I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention at least one questionable consumer doo-dad too, such as Lollipopstar , a lollipop that attempts to turn \"candy into a concert in your mouth.\" No, I will not be elaborating further.

And while that DLC remains firmly in the realm of hopes and dreams for now, with a new year now upon us I am here to tell you that the foundation for that rumor has grown somewhat stronger. There are two big reasons for this. The first comes from IGN Poland , which said earlier this week ( Google translated ) that it first heard about this new expansion, \"from someone who has repeatedly provided us with reliable insider information,\" years ago. IGN Poland said it didn't publish anything about it at the time because the information all came from a single source (that's how actual journalism works), but in light of these new rumors it's opted to make the story public. IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could succ…",

I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows. Watching a clip of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay, the impact sounds were pretty jawbone-rumbling. The open-backed wired set was plugged in to a substantial DAC/amplifier combo, so they were obviously being pushed quite heavily, but boy did it make for some serious air movement. The soundstage seemed plenty wide, too, which should make for some great atmospheric audio. Asus says the frequenc…",

As posted to the Asus security board , \"An uncontrolled DLL loading path vulnerability exists in AsusSoftwareManagerAgent.\" With this, an attacker could mess with the app, \"potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution\". From here, the attacker could have a pretty serious level of access to your rig. As shared in the security record , this problem is of high severity, with a score of 8.5. Luckily, attackers need local access, so that certainly makes the exploit a little less worrisome. In this case, that severity is likely linked to how dire access would be, as opposed to how easy it is to pull off, as needing local access cuts out 99% of the world from your rig.

Except, that is, for monitors and what looks to me like the most exciting gaming display of 2026. I give you the LG UltraGear Evo 39GX950B , all 39 inches of it. This new gaming monitor has so much going for it. It gets LG's latest OLED panel tech (albeit minus the RGB-stripe subpixel layout ) and a 5K2K native resolution. That's 5,120 by 2,160 pixels. It's basically a 4K 16:9 pixel grid taken out to 21:9 aspect ultrawide. More specifically, it's essentially a 32-inch 16:9 monitor stretched out to 21:9. That means the 140-ish DPI pixel density is the same as a 32-inch 4K panel. Personally, when it comes to the best compromise between crispy precision for day-to-day computing and maybe creative workflows, overall panel size for immersion and tolerable GPU load for gaming, 32-inch 4K makes more sense than 27-inch 4K. The latter has better pixel density, for sure. But that's barely noticeable for games, and yet you will feel the smaller, less immersive panel size. And 32-inch 4K is still pretty sharp and offers really nice fonts …",

Now a team of over 30 developers known as Kinetic Games, the studio has revealed the launch of its new publishing label, aptly named Kinetic Publishing. Having learned a great deal about indie game development over the last five years, Knight, now the CEO of Kinetic, believes it's time to put that experience to use to help other independent developers. \"The fact we’ve grown so much as a company means we’re now in the place where we want to support studios who come under our wing, and provide the support I'd have appreciated at the start of my journey\", says Knight .

I suppose angry customers, low pay, and terrible hours aren't really that bad when it's all digital and you're holding the cards. It turns out, it's rather fun and relaxing running a fake store, managing stock and delivering expert customer service by way of your approachable, friendly demeanour. After rummaging through upcoming releases on Steam, I've immediately fallen in love with Rewind 99, the latest in the line of retail sims, which launches into early access in March 2026. It's got something no other retail sim has: pizzazz (it's set in the 90s). Your job is simple: you must turn around the last remaining video rental store and make it profitable in the face of a new challenger, RentNet—a digital streaming service that's well before its time. Yes, you have to change the tide of history to save VHS and the adorably tacky 90s arcade aesthetic. Either by yourself or with your friends, you'll need to run the video store and explore the surrounding town of Reshoot Springs on foot…",

But the whole Arm-on-PC thing still has so much to prove, the jury isn't just out, it hasn't even been vetted yet. Which leaves Intel and Panther Lake. Being pretty much the only genuinely new PC chip at CES means you could get the impression it wins the excitement prize simply by default. It comes first in a race of one, in other words. Strictly, that's true. But Panther Lake is also genuinely exciting for several reasons. For PC gaming, it's the new Arc B390 iGPU that's most compelling.

However, Panther Lake's official launch at CES has given both Intel and AMD ample room to take potshots at each other.

Tikoo said \"Strix Halo or Ryzen AI Max will kill it\" and that \"it's not even a fair fight at that point.\" He added that AMD's top-end chips are \"better than that in terms of graphics performance\" and that those looking for gaming will be buying gaming-specific chips anyway. In terms of performance, Tikoo points out Intel's benchmark results for Panther Lake were compared to lower-end and older Ryzen chips: \"They compared their highest-end to our midpoint.\" Earlier this week, Intel reported that its Core Ultra Series 3 Panther Lake chips are up to 77% faster in regard to gaming performance than Lunar Lake.

But, no, you can't expect to see PC monitors anything like that bright. One useful reference point here is that existing TV OLED panels are already rated at up 4,000 nits, with these new-gen OLEDs bumping that up to 4,500 nits. Existing OLED monitors, meanwhile, get nowhere 4,000 nits, typically topping out at 1,300 nits. So, OLED monitors based on a given equivalent generation of panel technology are much less bright on the desktop than their TV compatriots. We'll come back to the reasons why, but let's just cover off what the two big panel makers announced at CES this year. Samsung's latest QD-OLED panels aren't a radical departure.

Once you've got your head around the likes of Wolfram, Titanium, and Calcium , you'll need to get this resource en masse. Luckily, the Helium locations aren't all that far away. I recommend you have a gun and a good bundle of bullets with you, as you're likely to run into some monsters on the way. Plus, you'll be right next door to the Stabilizer blueprint location , so you can nab that too. StarRupture Helium location Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Creepy Jar) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Creepy Jar) While there are multiple deposits across the planet, the best place to find Helium-3 deposits in StarRupture is almost directly east of the lander where you start the game , near the Grubbler trees at the base of the mountain. Here you'll find two Helium vents that you can start harvesting. Take note that you'll need a Helium-3 Extractor , unlocked by reaching level six with the Slenian corporation, not the standard Ore Excavator.

Just like the Rotor and Tube blueprints to the northwest and the Stator blueprint in the north, the first few schematics are a short hike from the orbital lander where you'll have established your first base. The Stabilizer blueprint specifically is also near the best Helium location , which you'll soon need for new recipes, so I recommend checking it out while you're in the area. Beware that there are enemies in the area, so you should at least craft the starter Reaper pistol and a few hundred bullets. Alternatively, there will be no enemies here for a short while after a Raptura event (a solar flare, basically) when the planet is scorched.

In a post to the official Minecraft news blog , it was revealed that baby mobs will be getting an entirely new appearance. Prior to this drop, all baby mobs were just downsized versions of the fully grown model, with massive heads. Now though, this new look gives them single pixelated eyes and, depending on the mob, an entirely new model, like the little yellow blocky chick rather than a small chicken. According to game director Agnes Larsson, Minecraft's artists have given each mob \"unique textures and models that give each baby mob their own adorable look and identity.\" This applies to all passive mobs which you can breed in the overworld too, like ocelots, all 11 kitten versions, rabbits, all your standard farm animals, and wolf pups.

It's on the crafting and upgrades side. I hate inventory management and Arc Raiders is particularly bad at it: You're constantly bottlenecked on upgrades by a shortage of some items, while at the same time having an overabundance of other things you may or may not need later. Yes, it's deliberate and by design. But other extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov, despite being on a different level of brutality than Arc Raiders, at least have a player economy where you can fudge through some of the worst by selling and buying. Despite Arc Raiders being quite happy to connect players in-game, there's no means to swap or sell key items in order to get the stuff you really need. I think that, within reason, it's a problem the game should seek to address—and it seems to me that every player would be all-in on it.

It's impressive, especially for a multiplayer game. Some creative players took advantage of this and traded guns for binoculars, making incredible on-field reporting and even short films , all recorded inside the game—no CGI or greenscreen required. I suppose it was only a matter of time, then, until Hollywood tried to capitalise on Arc Raiders' sudden success.

According to Intel fellow Tom Peterson, its figures are now 'slightly north' of 100 million. \"We have shipped 100 million [AI PCs] already\" said Petersen, at an Intel briefing I attended earlier today. \"We've been doing this now for a couple of years, started off with Meteor Lake, and now Lunar Lake.

The idea is, you get a virtual 177-inch monitor beamed in front of your eyeballs via a Micro-OLED display within the glasses, covering 95% of your vision with a 57-degree field of view of excellent gaming fidelity. Why have a massive screen on your wall, when you can have a tiny one that creates the same effect in a wearable form factor ? Mmm. We'll get on to that in a minute, because I've got some ergonomic issues to discuss first. For a start, there's a substantial cable attached to the rear of the left arm, which makes putting them on a very awkward event. I did it in public and nearly poked myself in the eye, as the glasses seem destined to fall in on themselves as you bring them towards your face. Secondly, they made me look like a dork.

I have to say, its performance was pretty impressive—for an integrated graphics solution, at the very least. Due to my packed CES schedule (my fault entirely), I had less than an hour to quickly run some benchmarks and futz around in the odd game. Still, I'm enough of an old hand to know exactly what game I was benching first— Cyberpunk 2077 , of course. My test laptop was a non-descript Lenovo machine with an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H onboard, the top-end Panther Lake CPU from the new lineup. Still, the lack of discrete graphics hardware means I didn't subject the poor lappy to path tracing, or even ultra settings, at least at first. No, this is an iGPU, and expectations should be tempered—Intel says the Arc B390 is around 10% faster on average than an Nvidia RTX 4050, and that's not exactly a lightning-fast graphics card. High settings then, 1200p. No upscaling, no ray tracing. The result? (Image credit: Future) A perfectly …",

Now the two lands exist side by side, but anyone who crosses from one to the other is transformed, no longer quite the same person (or elf or boggart) they were on the other side. This duality is demonstrated in a short film called One Light, One Dark that's basically a Magic-themed Muppet musical, with characters designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop singing about how different their lives are on either side of the twilight border. On the one side, they playfully squeeze frogs. On the other, they murder pigeons. Swings and roundabouts, really. It's delightful is what it is. And while it's also a perfect opportunity for the Fun Police to say how this proves Magic is better when it concentrates on its original setting rather than crossovers, I think I'd be even more stoked if this was a Muppets/Labyrinth/Dark Crystal set.

    "body": "StarRupture drops you onto a hostile alien world inhabited by shrieking bugs orbiting a sun that frequently blasts you with scorching rays. While there's a brief tutorial for the early access survival game, you're largely on your own when it comes to figuring out anything but the basics. So if you're looking for the Stator blueprint , an important early production item, you might be wondering where you even begin to search. Thankfully, the Stator blueprint isn't all that far from your starting point—in fact, you've probably spotted the location the moment you stepped out of the landing pod—though you will have to do some running and bug-killing to find it. Make sure you've at least crafted a pistol and some ammo before you head out, but you won't need more than that. StarRupture Stator blueprint location Watch the video above, which begins at the starting zone just outside your lander. Look almost directly north and you'll see a ruined structure in the distance on a ridge . It's hard to see, but it's there—if it helps, orient yourself by looking at the huge metal turbine that dominates the landscape, then swing your view left until you see the structure. With your pistol ready, ju…",

As noticed by Rock, Paper, Shotgun , PEGI has posted a rating for a game called Life is Strange: Reunion, and even given us an outline of what it's all about. The title itself is also a pretty clear hint as to what's coming. \"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret,\" the PEGI rating page says. \"Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.\" There's also at least one spoiler in the rating, and avert your eyes now if you don't want to know: At one point during a party scene, the player is offered the option to drink some wine. But the drink is spiked, and you end up \"tripping balls\" on magic mushrooms—so if you don't want that to happen, just say no. (Really, you shouldn't be accepting open drinks from strangers under any circumstances. That's just a basic survival technique these days.) Life is Strange: Reunion will also feature \"depictions …",

That's thin by itself, but then Kotaku came along and said the same thing, citing its own sources: A new Wolfenstein game is happening.
