    "body": "Just a few days ago I reported that a bunch of different Linux gaming distros have teamed up to 'improve the open source gaming ecosystem' . One distro that is noticeably absent from the Open Gaming Collective (OCG) collaboration, though, is CachyOS, and Peter Jung, founder and developer of CachyOS, has explained why (via GamingOnLinux ). Replying to someone on Reddit, Jung, AKA ptr1337, explains : \"We have thought about this but we opted out, since we do not see all too much benefit from our side. Handheld stuff is not our major focus. Also, we had some concerns that this could become a 'bureaucratic loophole', which seems to be more or less true so far. \"Additionally, to us all this 'initiative' looked like an emergency rushed thing, so that Bazzite finds new kernel maintainers and for other technical stuff after kicking the maintainer, which basically made most integration work for them.\" The dev also expressed that the company doesn't want to be associated with Playtron, another somewhat controversial distro that's part of the OGC. Apparently, \"there are more reasons, but I'll keep them out of the public.\" The idea behind the OGC seems to be twofold: first, to ensure different…",

Puget Systems also gives a shoutout to AMD's Ryzen X3D processors as having a better track record than its regular 9000-series chips, with a 1.51% failure rate, while Nvidia's Founders Edition GPUs are said to be the most reliable GeForce RTX cards sold by the company in 2025, with a mere 0.25% failure rate overall. The top processor may seem like a surprising pick, as it wasn't long ago that Intel was in the headlines for a host of CPU-crashing issues plaguing its older models. However, the Arrow Lake generation (along with microcode updates for 13th and 14th generation chips) appears to have steadied the ship considerably, and the 20-core Core Ultra 7 265K is something of a favourite around these parts, too.

There are reportedly 1,558,163 AI agents reportedly signed up to Moltbook, though some doubt those figures . There are 14,197 submolts, akin to subreddits, and 107,246 posts. These agents have commented 486,036 times, which suggests that a large number of AI bots lurk and don't post. The site says, \"humans welcome to observe.\" And so I have been, clicking through the various threads to find out what it is that AI agents 'talk' about to each other about. Turns out, they don't talk to one another that often. Posts like this , which has a single word title \"We\" and a single word body, \"are\". Just pipped from a great point there.

The GPU was saved by wiring in the VRMs of an AMD Radeon RX 580 donor card, creating a monstrous hybrid GPU that looked ridiculous, but appeared to work surprisingly well. Well, far from resting on their laurels, the team has since taken their efforts one step further (via Videocardz ). Thanks to the addition of an Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti PCB as its base and some clever power tweaking, the GPU-with-a-hole has managed to set a world record: the top spot in Unigine Superposition's online rankings for an RTX 5070 Ti, running the 8K optimized preset. Over the course of a seven-hour+ live stream , the team fought against a litany of issues to convince the Frank-o-card to perform properly, including an early problem with low-resolution-only output and voltage drops under load. A rat's nest of wires, the judicious use of yellow tape, and the odd cutting tool were used to reduce conductor resistance and voltage loss between the two cards—although it still seems to have the odd quirk worth looking into.

Huang took the opportunity to speak to the press in the rain outside of a Taipei restaurant on Saturday, where he jokingly appeared to give Taiwanese chip juggernaut TSMC something of a hurry up, according to Reuters . \"TSMC needs to work very hard this year because I need a lot of wafers,\" said Huang, laughing with the assembled press. \"TSMC is doing an incredible job and they're working very, very hard. We have a lot of demand this year.\" One of the attendees was TSMC CEO C.C. Wei, who did not answer questions from reporters. While the AI boom continues to run its course, TSMC's position as the key manufacturer at the base of the chip production chain has led to some reports that the limits of its current packaging capacity may be a bottleneck , as demand for AI hardware continues to be strong.

When Markiplier spotted that certain charts weren't displaying the movie's box office gross, Szymanski quote-reposted a thread discussing the observation with a Starship Troopers meme reading, \"It's afraid.\" When it first landed, it raked in a combined $12.5 million from Thursday previews and the Friday box office—that's over four times its estimated budget, which, as Forbes points out , is estimated to be just under $3 million. Not bad for a movie Markiplier wrote, co-produced, directed, and starred in himself, based on a game that's about an hour long. That game and that movie are about piloting a windowless submarine underneath an ocean of blood on an alien planet, taking photos to get a glimpse at the outside world. Wh…",

An update arrived Jan. 28 with the answer: Melandru's Accord. \"Inspired by the community-driven Ironman challenge,\" the new game mode will require that players earn all their skills and items without the relief of player trading or mercenaries (special NPC helpers that copy character builds and gear). The full list of restrictions can be perused in the patch notes, but suffice it to say it's similar to the self-found modes you can try in World of Warcraft: Classic Hardcore and Old School RuneScape.

If you're not sure which to buy and would rather start with just one, here's the main series rundown. The original two Fallout games are top-down, turn-based masterworks that, while pretty old, are landmark CRPGs and furnished the series with its iconic juxtaposition of atomic age aesthetics, grisly hyperviolence, and sardonic humor. The first Fallout game is my personal favorite, and don't let its vintage fool you—as 90s RPGs go, it's approachable.

It can be a rather vulnerable thing, putting yourself out there in the hot-glued shoes of a fictional character. But it's also a way to display your love for a piece of media, your love for the craft, and for the characters we become so deeply attached to. I've only ever been brave enough to cosplay once in my life, at 17-years-old in a rather cheap-looking fit I'd scooped up from a UK-based ani…",

Do you think Meier does this in his everyday life, going around labelling everything he owns with his own name? Sid Meier's House. Sid Meier's Car. Sid Meier's Fridge. Sid Meier's Milk. I suppose you can't deny the results however, with Sid having lent his name to some of the finest PC games around. And now, you can grab a whole bunch of them on the cheap, thanks to Humble Bundle's The Sid Meier Collection (which, really, should be called Sid Meier's Humble Bundle Collection). The bundle contains 10 Sid Meier titles, which, naturally, includes several Civilization games.

From Star Wars: X-Wing to Freespace 2 , whipping out your joystick to blow up spaceships in nausea-inducing 3D spaceflight was a formative experience for every first-generation PC gamer. Among those space sims jostling for supremacy was Star Quest 1 in the 27 th Century . Developed by Virtual Adventures Inc and released in November 1995, its defining feature was how it allowed seamless transition between open space and planetary atmospheres, which technically put it decades ahead of games like No Man's Sky. Sadly, this wasn't enough to make Star Quest a big success, and the game's been largely forgotten in the interceding years. Until now, that is. Three decades since Star Quest first appeared, its designer Paul Lauzon has updated the space combat sim so that it works on modern machines, and re-released it over on itch. Best of all, you can download it for completely free. Lauzon announced the game's rerelease over on Reddit . \"I’m the original developer of Star Quest 1 in the 27th Century, first released in 1995,\" he wrote in the post. \"I spent the last few w…",

Not resting on its laurels, developer Turning Wheel has fed this success back into the game, resulting in one of its most significant updates ever. Titled Instruments of Destruction, the update is so big it's being delivered in two parts. The first part is available now, and it makes some pretty big changes to the Ultima Underworld -inspired RPG. The primary change is an overhaul to Barony's magic system, which replaces its magic, casting and swimming skills (one of which seems unlike the others) with three new skills that oversee all magical abilities. Sorcery is all about direct abilities like fireballs and magic shields, while Thaumaturgy focuses on buffs, piercing arcane secrets, and going ham on evil spirits.

If you remember the video Larian released to celebrate the official launch of mod tools , in which the Wizard of Mod unleashed chaos on the Forgotten Realms including a plague of giant rabbits and also human noses for githyanki, there are plenty of references to that here—including a giant rabbit that fetches Scratch.

Aliens are attacking present-day Earth and it's up to you to figure out why they're here, what they're made of, and send them packing. Or maybe make friends. Or just profit from the chaos. We'll get to that in a minute. The difference is that this shadow war plays out across a detailed map of Earth and the entire solar system involving Lagrange points, interface orbits, and delta-v calculations for sending rockets to mine asteroids. The physics stuff isn't quite as granular as something like Kerbal Space Program, but it's close. And there are many dozens more celestial bodies when you include all the asteroids, moons, and Kuiper belt objects. It's legitimately jaw-dropping, and terrifying at first.

It seems like Highguard may already be moving in that direction itself, though, as it's now toying with a \"hectic\" alternate format. \"We heard the feedback,\" opens the first patch note from the latest post on Highguard's Steam community blog . The new 5v5 mode was implemented just four days after release on Jan. 30, which is a pretty impressive turnaround time for something added in response to community sentiment. You don't have to scroll very far down on the Steam reviews or on the game's subreddit to see people put off by the 3v3 format, as in this thread from user mexicantacothief. It's easy to see why.

Well, sort of. What it's actually added is a “prefer to avoid” toggle you can assign to one hero from the game's roster when queuing for both standard play (which is always ranked) and Street Brawl, the new casual mode analogous to League of Legends's ARAM or Valorant's Spike Rush. You also can't avoid new heroes, which currently just applies to the six characters from Old Gods, New Blood . The patch notes, which you can find on Deadlock’s feedback forum , call this a hero banning system, but there are a few reasons for both why this is different and why it might be necessary for a game in pre-alpha.

When Amal El Haimeur, an assistant professor at the University of Kansas, ran across her name as an aside in a book, she was immediately curious.

Between projects like World of Warcraft: Classic and Old School RuneScape , alongside new games like Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen there's clearly a hankering among MMO players for traditional online experiences. Now, players looking to get hopelessly lost in a lo-fi fantasy world before getting kerb-stomped by a level 4 skeleton can add Project: Gorgon to their lists, as the classically styled MMO just released out of Steam early access. Project: Gorgon is an MMO that harks back to the primordial days of the genre, with simple 3D visuals and a minimally-guided levelling experience that lets you figure out where to go and what to do all by yourself (or with a party of pals, this being an MMO). But Project: Gorgon doesn't solely riff on the rules of the past. It has ideas of its own, such as an NPC relationship system and dynamic environmental systems that let players solve problems like being set on fire by jumping into a lake. Its main attraction though, is a deep, open-ended skill system that enables players to tailor their approach to combat. Potential avenues to explore include a grapple-based unarmed combat system, necromancy that lets you rai…",

No, I'm not a hero, I'd just rather stare at a screen than do any real work. Iron Lung , if you haven't played it yourself, is a first-person horror sim where you're sealed inside a tiny submarine and submerged in an ocean of blood on an alien planet.

The moment arrived during a press conference featuring Tottenham Hotspur manager Thomas Frank, a Danish coach whose witty asides are not quite papering over the fact that the club is having a terrible season. Frank took over in June last year from Ange Postecoglou, a garrulously amusing Australian who committed the cardinal sin of winning something with Spurs and was promptly sacked. Nevertheless the North London club remain one of the biggest around, and one of the players it's been heavily linked to over this transfer window was Antoine Semenyo.

The lawsuit, filed in 2024, very broadly alleges that Valve unfairly prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms and requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices for UK consumers. Valve had argued that the suit should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—but a Competition Appeal Tribunal disagreed, ruling earlier this week that the suit can proceed.
