On the album, the four express how they&#8217;ve changed, the energy they give off, their indelible memories, the messages they want to convey, and so much more, with an honest and unflinching approach that shows just how strong the band truly is.

Nearby Ring cameras can automatically flag dogs that resemble a missing pet and alert users, who can choose whether to share footage with the dog’s owners. The AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog per day since it launched. Losing your dog is often a panic-inducing event, and you immediately want everyone in the neighbourhood on the lookout. While most of your neighbours would probably like to help, they’re busy with their own lives. Ring is now leaning into that reality by opening up its Search Party for Dogs feature to everyone, whether they own a Ring security camera or not. According to an announcement from the Amazon Newsroom , the AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog a day with their owners since its launch, but it was previously limited to Ring camera owners. With this expansion, anyone can now post a missing dog alert through the app and have nearby Ring cameras hunt for it, even if they don’t have any of the brand’s hardware themselves.",

After looking into the code, we can say that this feature will work in Samsung’s own phone app and won’t require you to install Google Dialer. This also clears any doubt regarding the pre-installation of the Google Dialer app on Samsung. Google’s app will not come pre-installed on your next Galaxy device.

Google is therefore continuing to drop new features in Gemini to entice users, and is now testing three new features. But in addition to adding new features for users, Google may also be looking to simply replace another chatbot with Gemini. Out of the features Google is currently testing in Gemini, the most compelling appears to be the ability to import chats from other AI chatbots while retaining all information and media shared in those chats. Alexey Shabanov of TestingCatalog has discovered a new “Import AI Chats” option in Gemini’s attachment menu.

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority My daughter has had the Galaxy S22 for years now and has taken great care of it. Unfortunately, even the most careful phone owner isn’t immune to accidents, and her phone was bumped out of her hands, where it fell to its untimely death. I decided she needed a replacement, but we agreed it didn’t necessarily need to be a top-tier flagship. We settled on the Galaxy S25 FE (), which I was able to get for under $500. From the moment we set it up, I noticed how familiar this phone felt to my own Galaxy S24, inside and out. After setting it up, I didn’t dwell on it much until about a week or two later, when I asked my daughter if she was okay with the phone still. Her response was that, if anything, it felt like a big upgrade over her Galaxy S22 in terms of battery life, and she appreciated the larger display.",

The premium 4.2-inch, 4:3 handheld has a powerful G3x Gen 2 SoC and starts at $319 for the month of February, with a free gift pack. AYANEO has done the unthinkable. The company that has been the target of so many shipping complaints over the years just shadowdropped its latest Pocket S Mini handheld, skipping crowdfunding and pre-order periods altogether. Ok, so it’s not quite a complete shadowdrop, since the company has teased the Pocket S Mini since September , but now we finally have full specs and pricing. As the name implies, it has the same premium design language as the Pocket S, with an all-metal CNC frame and an all-glass front. The 4.2-inch 4:3 LCD panel appears to be the same one as the budget Pocket Air Mini (though the company promises it’s been improved), and it’s the ideal resolution for retro games.",

Concerns about privacy and AI scraping have already prompted my colleagues to seek more privacy-focused alternatives to Google Drive , and I can’t say I blame them. In fact, I’ve been spurred into joining them. Now, I must state that the easiest way to sidestep some AI concerns is to simply disable Google Drive’s AI features under Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Manage Workplace smart features and turn off the toggle. Simple enough. However, I am also constantly running afoul of Google Drive’s storage limits, and I refuse to spring for the expensive 2TB plan. While I’ve always been somewhat bothered by entrusting my documents to a third-party, AI nonsense is finally the push I need to move another one of my services out of the cloud and back under my control.",

The chief feature, though, is the new U1 UWB chip that is said to improve precision finding and propel the AirTag (2nd gen) far ahead of most of its competitors, many of which still don’t even have a UWB chip. However, in true Apple fashion, there are still lots of missing and potentially old-school features in the new tag, including the lack of cross-platform compatibility (because Apple, duh). This leaves the field of Bluetooth tracker competitors very much alive and blooming, and since I’ve been testing many of these trackers for the last 18 months, I’ll let you in on a secret: There are better trackers out there that work both on Android and iOS, and you should buy them instead.",

Google Assistant, Siri, and even the newer Gemini integrations are essentially voice-activated search engines with a few smart home toggles attached.

It features a 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display that tops out at 2480 x 1860 resolution in black and white, with 1240 x 930 specs for color. It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools.

With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android.

Apps are going missing from Google’s Nest Hub smart displays . A Reddit post showing a relatively empty app drawer on a Nest Hub led us to check our own devices — and sure enough, my Nest Hub Max is also missing shortcuts to apps it once had, though I’m not sure when they disappeared. User Head_Worldliness5101 posted on the Google Home subreddit yesterday, saying that the apps previously accessible from the app drawer on their second-generation Nest Hub smart display are now mostly gone, leaving only Sling, Stories, and YouTube TV.

One big focus could be better hardware support for modern codecs. There are maybe three kinds of Android TV users out there. We’ve got our Google fans, who will go with a device like the Google TV Streamer largely because — much like Pixel users with their phones — they want first look at all of Google’s latest features. Then we’ve got the budget crowd who just wants to find the most affordable streaming solution around. But then, there are the power users. They want hardware with versatile ports, the performance to game on their TVs , and they want to buy from a company that’s going to follow through with software support. And for a long, long time, that’s meant pretty much one option: NVIDIA Shield TV . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The images published today show a device that looks pretty much like what we saw in renders the outlet shared in November , though in a dark gray color this time.

In a new post on X , AYANEO confirmed that the Pocket PLAY will be powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 9300 chipset.

The compact Find X9s could come in Titanium, Orange, and Blue finishes, while the Find X9 Ultra could come in Orange, Black, and Brown. The Find N6 foldable could come in Orange and Titanium colors. 2026 could be a big year for OPPO, as the company is widely rumored to be launching several of its top Android flagships globally. This includes not only its foldable flagship, the Find N6, but a wider foldable expected to be called the Find N7 , as well as phones like the Find X9s and Find X9 Ultra in its flagship lineup. As we inch toward these launches, a new leak sheds more light on the colors we can expect on some of these phones, as well as their global release timelines.

    "body": "TL;DR OnePlus’ bypass charging feature now works beyond gaming, letting phones pull power directly from the charger during heavy use to reduce heat and battery wear. More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

On the afternoon of January 14, Verizon’s wireless voice, text, and data services failed for users across the country. Outage reports quickly rose on trackers like Downdetector, reaching hundreds of thousands in just a few hours.

The vivo X200 Ultra and vivo X300 Pro are both available with an optional camera kit, which includes a camera case, camera grip, and an external lens to boost long-range photography. Now, the company behind these accessories has launched a similar kit for iPhones. PGYTech has announced the RetroVa Vintage Imaging Kit for iPhones , which is now available on Kickstarter . In fact, the kit has already blown past its $10,000 goal, accruing over $55,000 as of writing.",

The image confirms that the next Galaxy Unpacked event will happen on February 25, where Samsung is expected to debut its new flagships and the Galaxy Buds 4 lineup. The Galaxy S26 series is rumored to go on open sale closer to mid-March. The first month of the year is almost out, with no official announcement from Samsung about its next set of flagship phones. While the company has confirmed they’ll arrive in the first half of the year, and many of you likely already have a good idea of when, that familiar pre-launch hype has yet to kick in. All we have till now is a teaser for the upcoming Privacy Display feature the company is cooking up for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Now, trusted leaker Evan Blass has shared what appears to be an official Samsung teaser with the launch date printed front and center.",

The change introduces a new “geofenced variable power” category, allowing higher power and outdoor use under specific conditions. While little will change overnight, the decision could improve future Wi-Fi performance for your phone, smart home gear, and more. Wi-Fi doesn’t usually make headlines unless something breaks, but this week it got a boost that could shape the next wave of connected gadgets. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has voted to expand how unlicensed devices can use the 6 GHz band, a move that could make future Wi-Fi gear faster and more flexible than what we have today. As Fierce Network reports, the FCC’s decision creates a new category of unlicensed devices called geofenced variable power (GVP). This allows certain products to use higher power levels than before, including outdoors, as long as they rely on location-based controls to avoid interfering with existing users of…",

A much larger cover screen is also said to be coming, while the inner screen could grow to 7.5 inches. The camera setup could get its own dedicated space instead of sharing it with the outer display like before. HUAWEI’s follow-up to one of the most unconventional flip phones of recent years seems poised to push its weird-but-wonderful design even further. A new leak suggests the HUAWEI Pura X2 would be a rethink of the form, especially how you interact with it before and after unfolding. When HUAWEI launched the first Pura X in 2025, it stood out by offering a wide 16:10 inner display instead of the usual tall, narrow screen. This made reading, browsing, and multitasking feel more natural, even if video playback left black bars.",
