This will introduce new quests, visitors, furniture, and the most exciting part: at least two new avatars for your character. That's right, you're no longer limited to the set of animals you can pick from at the start of the game, we're getting a pair of amphibians. The two characters shown in the reveal are an axolotl and a frog, and much like every other critter you can pick as your playable character, you'll still be able to customise them with the colour palettes you've unlocked while exploring the island. Which is fantastic news as it'll take a lot for me to change my current pastel pink bunny. On the topic of customisation, a few of the patch notes also share that tweaks have been made to certain clothing items. Clipping issues for the Monster Beanie, Scholastic Berets, My Melody Pirate Hat, and the My Sweet Piano outfit have now been resolved, meaning no matter the shape of your character you'll be able to make the most of your wardrobe.

    "body": "علق أحمد عطيف، نجم نادي الشباب السابق، على ما يثار بشأن سهولة جدول النصر في الأسابيع الأولى من دوري روشن السعودي للمحترفين، ما جعله يتصدر ترتيب المسابقة بالعلامة الكاملة. وحصد النصر 8 انتصارات في أول 8 جولات ليصبح في الصدارة منفردا برصيد 24 نقطة وبفارق 3 نقاط عن التعاون الوصيف، و4 عن الهلال الثالث. وسبق أن أطلب الأمير نواف بن سعد رئيس نادي الهلال تصريحات أكد فيها أن النصر استفاد من جدولة مبارياته في هذا الموسم، إذ لم يواجه منافسا قويا حتى الآن، ليصبح متصدرا للمسابقة بالعلامة الكاملة. لكن عطيف لا يتفق مع هذا الرأي، حيث قال في تصريحات تلفزيونية: \"لو أن الأمر بهذه الصورة، فلنجعل الدوري 6 أندية فقط، ولا داع لوجود باقي أندية الدوري!\". وأوضح أن كل الفرق ستواجه نفس المنافسين فبالتالي لا معنى من التشكيك في صدارة فريق كونه قد واجه فرقا يراها آخرون أنها ليست صعبة بالقدر الكافي. وأضاف: \"النصر واجه الاتحاد حامل اللقب وتفوق عليه، كما هزم التعاون الذي يعد ثاني أفضل فريق في الدوري من بعده\". وتابع: \"من يريد أن يتصدر عليه أن يفوز في كل مبارياته\". اختبار حقيقي كما تحدث عطيف عن النصر هذا الموسم، مؤكدا أنه رغم تصدر الفريق بأفضلية واضحة لجدول المسابقة، لكن الموسم لا يزال طويلا وصعبا، ولن يكون الفوز باللقب سهلا بالنسبة لفريق المدرب جورجي جيسوس. وتابع قائلا: \"أرى أن الفوز بدوري أبطال آسيا 2 ربما يكون مت…",

As a result, Requiem is already looking very different to its two immediate predecessors: instead of seedy backwaters and toothless hicks, the footage we've seen thus far takes place in the claustrophobic environs of faceless high rises and labyrinthine halls. In that sense, it's quite reminiscent of Resident Evil 2. During a chat with Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa, I noted the shared DNA in Resident Evil 4 and Village, and asked if Requiem might have a similar relationship with any older entry in the series. He confirmed my theory with no hesitation: \"I believe in that regard, it's very close to Resident Evil 2,\" he said. Aside from the setting, Requiem also has a stronger focus on the qualities of its player-character than the last two instalments. Sure, Ethan Winters had a backstory, a personality, and a very pressing motive, but Kumazawa makes an interesting distinction between Ethan and Requiem's new protagonist Grace Ashcroft, who is extremely vulnerable and unused to confrontation or violence. \"When you look at Res…",

That's because the world finally has a feature players have been asking for since it first arrived in early access nearly two years ago: water. The Wake of the Water update arrived this week, bringing a new high-level biome to the already massive Embervale map. Veilwater Basin is a tropical jungle filled with lakes, waterways, and sunken ruins to explore, and the region is also perfect for building a new base because you can put all that water to use. Since Enshrouded's water is simulated in real time, you can dig canals for irrigating crops or powering new crafting stations, and you can move water around in containers to fill your own lakes and ponds. There are even waterproof walls included in the update if you want to build an underwater base—and something tells me you do. Just be careful: if you remove the wrong block down there, water will immediately begin flooding your submerged home. You're not the only one moving into Veilwater Basin. A lizard-like race called Drak are also elbowing their way into the region, and not only are they strong swimmers but they can use weapons underwater—unlike you. You might w…",

The ex Geralt never properly ended things with, and the canon love interest as book readers will tell you (it's me, I'm book readers), she complicates Geralt's love life and forces him to belatedly grow up—which feels thematically appropriate, as he retakes his place as Ciri's father figure over the course of the game. Yet that element wasn't always part of The Witcher 3. As Badowski says, \"It wasn't [there] from the beginning, but at some point we understood that this lack of kind of conflict, personal conflict—of course, there's Ciri—but there was a lack of something .\" As soon as someone suggested the idea of making players c…",

Today there are a lot more games there. We definitely feel that there are some really, really good co-op games out there right now. Helldivers 2, obviously, and lately we've seen Arc Raiders do extremely well.\" It's getting harder to predict what will pop off or stick around in the PC multiplayer space, which was much less crowded when Deep Rock entered early access in 2018.

    "body": "Nothing about PUBG and Subnautica 2 publisher Krafton's recent decision to become an \"AI-first company\" look good. The company plans to drop over 130 billion won ($88 million) into the project, recently stopped hiring new employees, and started a voluntary resignation program for its employees in South Korea this week. Far down the ladder from these decisions is Eleventh Hour Games, the developer behind Last Epoch, which Krafton acquired in July . The timing couldn't have been worse as it happened right after the founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds were unceremoniously fired for what they claim was a move to avoid paying a $250 million earnout. At the time, EHG founder Judd Cobler told fans of the budding action RPG that having a corporate owner would only benefit the game in the long run by giving them access to more resources and employees. Fans of the game were understandably skeptical about how the buyout would impact the game. That skepticism turned into outright worry when Last Epoch's first expansion, Orobyss, was announced during a Sony State of Play in September. Ever since the Last Epoch Kickstarter in 2018, EHG promised that once you buy the game, everything…",

The series started out great. It gave the stale and yet seemingly never-ending Alien saga something it really needed: a kick in the butt. Instead of just one Alien, it gave us a bunch of different types of aliens, including a weird eyeball creature that is both horrifying and yet kinda cuddly? Instead of a single android, standard for Alien movies, it also featured a cyborg and several synthetic people with human minds transplanted into them. And instead of a xenomorph slowly picking off people one by one from the shadows, this big alien boi was just right out there in broad daylight, mass-murdering entire groups of people in mere seconds like a buzzsaw. Alien: Earth was pretty silly, but I liked the anything goes approach of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what slithers. But as the first season concluded it …",

The most popular ones simply won't work when Midnight arrives as part of Blizzard's plan to level the playing field for all players. Unsurprisingly, this hasn't gone over well with everyone. Some addon developers have called it quits , while others have expressed concerns over Blizzard's new rules. Professional world first raiders aren't sure what their jobs are going to look like in the next year and more casual players are worried their favorite classes are being over-simplified as a result. In a lengthy post about this new era of addon support, game director Ion Hazzikostas explains why any of this is happening now, what exactly is changing, and how things will move forward as the Midnight beta continues. \"We take none of this lightly,\" he says, adding that Blizzard has \"never designed [encounters] FOR addons,\" but it has \"inevitably had to design AROUND them for the past several expansions.\" Basically the problem was this: When a boss marks five players with ticking bombs, addons can just tell those people where…",

For more than four years, Romero has been politely but pointedly correcting every inaccurate memory and anecdote Petersen's shared on Twitter (now X) from his time working at id Software. Nearly each tweet begins with some variation of \"Hi Sandy, hope you're doing well\" before nuking the original statement from orbit. Petersen joined id during the development of Doom in 1993, working on several of the game's levels and designing more for Doom 2. He also worked on Quake before leaving the studio in mid-1997, about a year after Romero's exit. That makes for a good bit of overlap, though of course Romero was with id from the beginning, having co-founded the studio in 1991. Romero, notably, has talked about having hyperthymesia , which he credits for giving him a vivid memory. I don't know if his recall is perfect , but each time Petersen trots out an id…",

That's largely kept me away from grand strategy and 4X games, which tend to offer the richest sandboxes to the most committed players, occasionally at the cost of accessibility to newcomers. The only series in the style that's truly won my heart is Age of Wonders, the fourth of which you can try for free this weekend until Monday, Nov. 17. If you're not familiar, Age of Wonders marries the deep strategy of 4X to turn-based tactical RPG gameplay. It also grounds a lot of the map-painting in intuitive, tangible roleplay scenarios: You don't play a faceless nation, but a customizable ruler and culture, gathering magical artifacts, schools of magic, skills, and provinces as you explore the world. You can play as anything from classic fantasy dwarfs to gothic, power-mad molemen, and territory is won with turn-based battles made up of your custom troops. In his review , online editor Fraser Brown said Age of Wonders 4 \"demands to be played over and over,\" and I concur. It's also a great hangout game with asynchronous multiplayer that can be played cooperatively or com…",

Just minutes before it was set to deliver its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year, Ubisoft mashed the brakes on the whole thing, postponing the release of its results to an unspecified future date. The company also requested that European exchange Euronext halt trading of the company's shares and bonds from November 14 until the publication of its results. No reason for the postponement or trading halt was provided, but these things are rarely the result of good news. They often arise from events like unexpected major news announcements or regulatory problems that can have the potential to trigger panic selling. (Image credit: Ubisoft) There's no sign that's the case here, but Ubisoft is in a unique and precarious situation right now. The company's share price is in the toilet, and it recently entered into a deal with Tencent to establish a new \"creative house\" called Vantage Studios that will assume control of the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six properties. Leading up to that, though, was something of a low-key power struggle : Tencent wanted to assert more control over Ubisoft, but the founding Guillemot family …",

If you knew where to find them, a typical Security Breach raider could fill their backpack with purple drops and then extract without ever putting themselves in danger. As of this morning, Embark has stealthily nerfed it. \"We adjusted the security lockers because they were over-providing valuable items,\" Embark representative Ossen said in a reply on the Arc Raiders Discord server.

Sadly, we're going to have to wait a bit longer for anything specific, but the official trailer for Season 2 just dropped, and I think it'll tide me over until the episodes finally come out. There is a hell of a lot to unpack in the short two-minute 38-second trailer, but I'm going to try my best to do so. (Image credit: Prime Video) At the end of Fallout Season 1 , our main cast of characters had split up, and it seems like the second season will follow a similar structure to the first in that episodes will cut between the various groups, following their stories side by side. It looks like Maximus and Thaddeus are still together, although Thaddeus has seen better days, as his recent ghoulification has had a couple of visual repercussions. The mouth on his collarbone does not look good. And Maximus still seems obsessed with \"that girl\", our protagonist Lucy MacLean.

In May of this year, AMD announced a massive new update to its upscaling tech, giving us our first glimpse of FSR 4 \"Redstone\" which was said to be bringing a whole host of machine learning-based improvements. One of the key features is the addition of Ray Regeneration, which, much like Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction tech , is said to be capable of regenerating inaccurate pixels to prevent the gritty, noisy mess that can surround some ray traced lighting effects. The Redstone update was supposed to be making an appearance at some point this year, but it's been so long since we'd heard anything about it, I'd nearly forgotten it existed.

The 1.20 update doesn't just add Stella Montis into the mix, but it also adds two new arcs, the Matriarch and Shredder, alongside making crafting cheaper, buffing some little arcs, and fixing one of the most annoying issues with PvP fights. (Image credit: Embark) Except for the Wolfpack grenade, which now needs an extra refined explosive, other items like Arc motion cores, circuitry, and launcher ammo are now all cheaper to make, with Spotter Relays and Wolfpacks also being worth more coins now. If you're a fan of the Hullcracker like I am, then this will be music to your ears, as cheaper launcher ammo means more arc explosions. The update also fixed an issue with the Fireball arcs, where they could get stuck on security gates, stopping them from chasing after raiders.

That's why the studio is following the Dead Cells playbook, partnering with another developer nearby in Copenhagen to create season six, which will come to Deep Rock early next year. The big draw for the new season is a spooky biome littered with the giant bones of ancient beasts, with a new enemy species to go with it. There are three types of Ossirans lurking in the Ossuary Depths, including a flying pest called the Scrab, the Pit Jaw, a \"living bear trap\" that can grab you if you walk over it, and the Bone Collector, which will pop up in other biomes.

It's not a new phenomenon; people have been complaining about graphics cards having just 8 GB of VRAM for years now. The problem really rose to the forefront with the RTX 4060 Ti , which initially launched with just 8 GB of VRAM to the chagrin of some . Nvidia then released a 16 GB version with a much higher price tag, which people also didn't like—many seemed to just want a 16 GB version with the 8 GB's price tag. The complaint is that 8 GB of VRAM isn't enough for gaming in 2025 in many cases. And this much is true for at least some games to run at higher settings, such as Hogwarts Legacy and The Last of Us Part 1 —this was resolved in The Last of Us Part 2 , though.

The affected models are the DSL-AC51 , DSL-N16 , and DSL-AC750 , and here are links to the firmware you should install for each of these: DSL-AC51: firmware DSL-N16: firmware DSL-AC750: firmware The firmware you want is the latest one, version 1.1.2.3_1010. You download this firmware, and then upload it to your router's firmware upgrade page. For instance, for the AC51, after downloading and unzipping the file on a PC connected to the router, you go to your router's administration page and navigate to Advanced Settings > Administration > Firmware Upgrade, then select Browse in the New Firmware File field, and click Upload. It will reboot when it's done. The particular Asus router pictured here and at the top of this article is no…",

It didn't work out so well back then, but this time , I think Valve has a real shot at finally decoupling a respectable chunk of PC gaming from Windows, if not the entire saucer section. Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: I'm considering whether I'd like a cube under my TV while hopping on a flight to help with the next PC Gaming Show, which airs December 4 . In 2017, I wrote a big report about why Steam Machines failed to take off, and the main thing Valve's hardware partners told me was that SteamOS just wasn't ready for the big leagues. The custom Linux distribution didn't support enough hardware or games, and only super-nerds had much enthusiasm for ditching Windows, especially as Windows 8 was being replaced by the much better-liked Windows 10. As a result, the original Steam Machines were never taken seriously as an alternative to desktop PCs or consoles like the Xbox One. Manufacturers started putting Windows on them to get them out the door. \"Nobody …",

Reddit user akia_Gecko has also uploaded a video to YouTube showing those log file writes by the AMD graphics driver in response to minor window movements. And it certainly looks pretty scary. As akia_Gecko says, \"every time you move a window or resize a window on your desktop, those files get modified multiple (hundreds!) of times.\" Of course, SSDs can be read almost indefinitely, but writes cause actual wear. Hammer an SSD with enough writes, and you'll kill it eventually. However, it does not necessarily follow that AMD's graphics driver will obliterate your SSD. Indeed, the AMD graphics driver probably isn't doing anything abnormal, because this kind of data logging is normal behaviour for a device driver.

If you jumped at the opportunity to start customising your character with accessories like I did, then you'll be thrilled to hear this too. Both DLCs will add five remix tracks and ten accessories each to the game. The first will arrive this month, adding five Dance Dance Remixes to the game alongside its mystery accessories. And, outside of the DLC content, all players will receive a cosplay set for Saki Hanami from Idolm@ster, which is potentially one of the greatest outfits I've seen yet in Katamari. I hope this also means we can expect more cosplays in the future, as I'd probably sell my soul for a Miku outfit. With that said, this outfit in particular is only available for the Prince, so you won't be able to dress any cousin up in full cosplay.

This mission sees you heading to the Departure Building in the Spaceport and scrounging up some old medical records still stored there. The main challenge, honestly, is just finding the Medical Exam Room and where said records are kept. The Departure Building might have a turret, or a pop or two to contend with, and it's also quite close to the centre of the map, where various other Arcs patrol. Thankfully, though, this building doesn't seem to get all that much Raider foot traffic despite its proximity to the Launch Towers. I'd suggest bringing a free loadout since you don't need to exfil any items this time around, but otherwise, here's how to complete Prescriptions of the Past. How to complete Prescriptions of the Past in Arc Raiders You can find the Medical Exam Room on the first floor of the Departure Building (Image credit: Embark Studios) Your first step is heading to the Departure Building on Spaceport, just to the west of the Launch Towers in the centre of the map.

The game's sequel was released on PS5 earlier this year , with the inevitable PC version yet to be given a release date, while two film adaptations— one live action , one animated —are in the works. Now Hideo Kojima has announced yet another Death Stranding tie-in is being developed for Disney+, and this time it's an anime. Death Stranding Isolations is the working title for the anime, which is due on Disney+ in 2027. Side note: every time the name is mentioned the press release puts \"(Working Title)\" after it, so I hope it's clear this is a working title. Hideo Kojima will act as executive producer on the series while Takayuki Sano, who has a list of anime credits longer than Kojima's Hollywood phonebook, is on directorial duties. The lovely art that accompanied the announcement is by Ilya Kuvshinov (Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045). The anime tells a distinct story within the universe, following a young man and woman on adventure and told through a \"traditional, hand-drawn 2D animation style\" by \"some of Japan’s top animation talent at E&H production\".

Understandably, the idea of having to play through multiple iterations of a game to fully complete it was intimidating, and many people I talked to just didn't have the time for it.
