The dummy measures 5.5mm thick, which is 0.3mm thinner than the Galaxy S25 Edge. It’s even thinner than the iPhone 17 Air, which measures 5.6mm. This year, Samsung released its first ultra-thin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge. The tech giant originally planned to follow it up with a sequel, but ultimately ended up canceling the Galaxy S26 Edge due to poor sales. As it turns out, the compromises required to shrink the phone down were not worth the squeeze. Although Samsung is no longer working on the S26 Edge, it did get far enough in the development process to create dummy units that we’re now seeing for the first time.

The layoffs are expected to begin next week, matching earlier rumors that changes were coming on November 20. The scope of the cuts is unclear, though further changes and possible location closures are likely. Last week, we reported on rumors suggesting that employee layoffs at Verizon were imminent. At the time, there wasn’t much information outside of whispers from employees, but now a new report from Reuters adds further credence to the claims. According to “people familiar with the matter”, Verizon will allegedly cut 15,000 jobs as part of the largest layoff in the company’s history. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This tool will allow you to share specific contacts with an app, rather than your entire contacts list. Access will be a one-time snapshot, and apps can request only the specific data fields they need. Your device’s contacts list holds a treasure trove of sensitive data that many apps want to get their hands on. Fortunately, Android’s permissions system prevents apps from accessing your contacts without your knowledge. Unfortunately, it’s an all-or-nothing system: You either grant an app access to all your contacts or none of them. This is highly problematic because it forces you to grant many apps full access to your contacts even if they don’t need it. Next year’s Android 17 update could tackle this problem by introducing a system Contacts Picker tool that allows you to select specific contacts to share with an app, rather than giving it access to your entire contacts list.

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority It’s never a great sign when a basic in-call control starts acting up on your flagship phone , but that’s been the reality for some Pixel owners lately. Reports have been piling up about the Pixel speakerphone button feeling slow or unresponsive during calls, and a problem with such a fundamental function is bound to be frustrating. We wanted to determine the actual extent of the issue among our readers. We reported on the buggy feature last week , outlining what appeared to be happening and the possible reasons behind it. Pixel 9 owners first raised the alarm back in May, and Pixel 10 owners have since joined them. The behaviour often looks the same — you tap the speakerphone toggle and nothing happens, or it takes a beat or two before it lights up. Some users have found workarounds for the issue, but these shouldn’t be necessary, and Google’s response to one reader didn’t do anything to alleviate concerns. We ran a poll to get a clearer picture of how often this is happening among our readership.",

Google is suing dozens of people it asserts are involved in a large-scale phishing operation.

In a blog post, Google details the Lighthouse operation: The kit generates text message-based phishing (or “smishing”) attacks that leverage existing brands in order to extract information from victims. If you’ve ever received a sketchy text that purports to be from a package delivery service, directing you to click a link to verify personal or payment info, it may have come out of Lighthouse.

Premium users can stick with this new mode or switch back to the completely random shuffle algorithm. The change doesn’t impact Smart Shuffle functionality. Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

The app launched a few weeks ago, but Play Store approval took a few extra weeks. It’s still early in development, and performance may be worse than AetherSX2/NetherSX2. PlayStation 2 emulation on Android has lagged behind its PC counterpart for years, but a new project is here to change that. Early builds of ARMSX2 have been available to sideload for a few weeks, but now the app is officially available on the Google Play Store with a new update that makes it better than ever. ARMSX2, like other PS2 emulators such as AetherSX2 , is based on the most popular PS2 emulator on PC, PCSX2. However, development on AetherSX2 ceased years ago, so it’s based on an outdated version of the PC emulator, which was in a relatively rough state. ARMSX2 seeks to remedy that by creating a brand new app that leverages the latest and greatest version of its PC counterpart.",

The company told Android Authority that the phone maintains “excellent health” after 1,400 charging cycles. This comes after the OnePlus 13 offered 1,000 charging cycles before effectively losing 20% of its capacity. The OnePlus 15 has just been launched in global markets, and it has a gigantic battery for a flagship Android phone . The company also claims that this battery will maintain 80% of its effective capacity after four years, but what does this actually mean? OnePlus’s aforementioned battery health claim is a departure from the rest of the industry, which typically measures battery degradation in charging cycles . So how many charging cycles can the OnePlus 15 endure before it reaches 80% of its effective capacity?",

Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7 earlier this year, and it has an ultra-thin and light form factor following years of iterative designs. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also delivered a thin form factor, but Samsung might go the extra mile with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. The Bell (h/t: Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that Samsung wants to make the Galaxy Z Flip 8 much thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. More specifically, the company is apparently aiming to reduce the Z Flip 8’s thickness and weight by more than 10%.

Disney, although hesitant, might have to oblige to reduce its losses and restore investors’ confidence ahead of its earnings call tomorrow. Over the past couple of weeks, Google and Disney have been at loggerheads due to a pricing dispute. What started with both parties’ failure to meet each other halfway in negotiations, resulting in more than 20 Disney channels, including ABC and ESPN, being removed from YouTube TV , has spread to other streaming platforms and blocked access to Disney’s paid content across other Google-owned platforms . The conflict is costing both parties. YouTube has been forced to issue refunds to customers for the unavailability of Disney-owned channels on YouTube TV and prevent them from cancelling subscriptions.

Whether I’m dropping my partner off at work, going on a long road trip, or nipping to the shop in a foreign town, Auto keeps me entertained, helps me communicate with loved ones, and aids navigation while driving. The experience isn’t flawless, though, especially when focusing on that latter use case. Google Maps is a mostly reliable and robust mapping application on Android, but its problems become apparent when used through Android Auto. Beyond its often questionable navigation suggestions, its UI frequently disrupts and distracts in an environment where information should be as legible as possible. This issue stems from Google’s reluctance to give drivers more UI control.",

While it’s more affordable than last year’s Cine Play 1, it’s still firmly in premium territory, starting at roughly US $1,670 for the base model or around US $1,950 with the optional stand bundle. The Cine Play 1 Plus delivers 3,500 lumens of brightness and claims 110% coverage of the BT.2020 color gamut, promising highly vivid colors. Its RGB laser light source is rated for approximately 25,000 hours, and the projector supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ for dynamic range playback. A new gaming mode also aims to cut input lag for console users. Meanwhile, the built-in 10 W stereo speakers support DTS Virtual:X and Dolby Audio to h…",

    "body": "TL;DR Ever spotted an emulator for Android with an unusual reference in its package name? There’s a good reason why. Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.
