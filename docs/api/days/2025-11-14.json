While chips like the Core Ultra 9 285K and Core Ultra 5 245K are far from sluggish, we clocked them as slower in games overall than some of the comparable chips from the older Raptor Lake generation, and nowhere near as good value in relative terms compared with their AMD competition. Nonetheless, new data from Mercury Research shows that, despite the frosty reaction towards these chips from the PC hardware community at large, it doesn't appear to have made as much of a dent in Intel's desktop market share as you might expect. MR reports that Intel's slice of the desktop CPU market is 4.9% lower in the third quarter of this year, compared to Q3 2025. So, despite AMD having had a relatively bumper year for desktop CPUs, it still trails behind Intel with 33.6% of the market share. And it's still lagging behind when it comes to mobile chips, too, where AMD's percentage share has actually dropped down to 21.9% compared to 22.3% in the same quarter last year. So, what's going on?

The new overclock upgrades certainly help, but—ammo crates, trophy systems, scramblers—field upgrades still aren't that fun in Black Ops 7 . Well, that was until I used the Drone Pod. This little device shoots out drones that chase down enemies and explode. And when I say chase, I mean it; these drones don't complain about having to travel halfway across the map to find a target. If that sounds incredibly annoying to play against, then you're spot on. They're easy enough to shoot, sure, but you're wasting ammo shooting them out of the sky (don't forget how long reloading takes), and they're the perfect distraction. While the drones are unlikely to score many kills (it requires two to hit a target to bag a kill), having one damage an enemy you're fighting is more than enough to seal the deal. It's basically an easy way to soften up the enemy or get them to fire their gun, wasting their ammo or even revealing them on the map if they're not using a suppressor. Using the new overclock system, you can even upgrade these drones, causing them to launch faster or leave a…",

Being bigger and more ambitious than its predecessor didn't save the retrofuturistic RPG any trouble, if this week's patch is any indication: it packs a wallop of over 350 fixes by my count. There's not much sexy to talk about—no new goodies, no balance changes that'll induce tears of joy—instead, it's death by a thousand cuts, if death was an improved game and cuts were small adjustments. For instance, the Bomb Suit armor had an issue where it reduced explosive damage dealt rather than taken; that little quirk should be addressed now, saving any grenade enjoyers further perplexity. The whole list can be found in a blog post on Obsidian's website , and while there are a shedload of minute changes, there are some highlights.

Whether directly, indirectly, tangentially, or just plain pointlessly. So, thank you Valve, for offering up three new pieces of Steam hardware this week that made not one mention of the initialism de jour: AI. The closest we got was when its engineers noted the Steam Machine was being targeted for 4K60 gaming, but only via the use of upscaling. Even then, it's an AMD-based system, and FSR has only just got itself updated to machine learning algorithms with the FSR 4 update. That, however, is still effectively tied to the Radeon RX 9000-series of graphics cards, and most definitely not available to the Navi 33 GPU at the heart of the Steam Machine's discrete GPU.

My recommendation is to start with the Dravec and hope that the other SMGs get a buff before you get around to them. You'll unlock the Dravec at level 34, but you can use it earlier than that if you have the Vault Edition of BO7, since this comes with a Mastercraft version of the gun. Either way, here's the best Dravec build in BO7.

That doesn't mean there isn't something to catch your eye, though, and an announcement from Adata and MSI, as well as a rumour about SK hynix, is great news for anyone who wants to go absolutely ham with RAM. Starting with the joint venture between Adata and MSI , a new DDR5 module is set to appear on the market that is certainly going to be snapped up by anyone who needs as much RAM as possible in their PCs, without sacrificing performance. AMD and Intel's latest top-end desktop platforms (i.e. X870E and Z890) support up to 256 GB of RAM. However, to reach this amount, you normally have to buy four 64 GB DIMMs, filling every slot on the motherboard. When you do that, you're typically forced to use the memory's lowest speed (e.g. 4800 MT/s), which isn't ideal for something like high-resolution video editing. The answer to this is Adata and MSI's 4-rank DDR5 modules. Where most DIMMs have just one or two ranks of memory, these sticks will be so loaded with DRAM modules that each one will offer up to 128 GB of capacity. Not only that, they'll be rated to run…",

Since grabbing both items in this quest is primarily based on RNG, I'd suggest you bring a safe pocket with which to store either should you strike lucky.

Kou said: \"We're facing [what has] never happened before, the HDD, DRAM, HPE, HBM, NAND, all in severe shortage in 2026. Most of our capacity [is] sold out.\" Kou also said that he'd spoken to other major manufacturers, and while he wasn't prepared to comment on their exact allocation policies, certain percentage distributions would be made between smartphones, PC, and automotive industries. \"Of course, the majority will go to AI and AI servers,\" he clarified. \"Balancing is very important so we can keep the whole industry moving forward.\" By the sounds of it, then, the heavy bias towards the AI industry looks set to continue, with us PC gamers left fighting for the scraps.

So it shouldn't really be a surprise that I'm excited for the prospect of custom Steam Machine launch screens. For those unaware, if you have a video file in the right resolution and format, SteamOS allows you to use it as a boot screen—it can be anything you choose. And naturally, people have already got to work on boot screens tailored to the upcoming Steam Machine. In particular, this GabeCube one posted by Redditor DentureTaco will surely be a go-to. The 'GabeCube' meme is already a little overused but frankly, I don't care. It's too good not to use, and this faux GameCube animation is fantastic. That staple Valve audio at the end sends nostalgic shivers down my spine, too.

Then charge $299 (AUD $499). It's a confident swing in a space dominated by Razer, SteelSeries, and Logitech, and for the most part, the Cloud Alpha 2 connects—if you actually need that base station. Battery life remains the headline. HyperX's previous Cloud Alpha Wireless —a long‑standing PC Gamer favorite for best wireless gaming headset until Razer took top honors— pulls a ludicrous 300 hours. The Cloud Alpha 2 Wireless, however, dials that back to a quoted 250. On paper it's a downgrade, but in real use it still feels like witchcraft. I gamed nightly, took Teams calls, and ran music on Bluetooth without ever thinking about the HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 Wireless ' battery. Even with both radios active, it never died. I still haven't charged it since unboxing. \"Charge it once a month and forget about it\" still applies, and it keeps HyperX well ahead of rivals tapping out after around 40–70 hours. The new…",

It's packed with a beefier processor, higher-capacity RAM, and a better Wi-Fi chip than Meta's top device, the Meta Quest 3 , and this all makes me think Valve has the guts to step into the ring with the company previously known as Facebook. This is before mentioning that Valve seems to have a bit of a hidden blade up its sleeve in the form of an included USB dongle that connects to a specially sectioned antenna in the headset for wireless streaming. This, combined with foveated streaming , means that the headset can pick up on where you're looking, focus all of the higher quality juice into that section, and render everything at a lower quality. And that's not the only selling point for the Steam Frame. Valve's Lawrence Yang told us it \"represents a fundamental shift in the way that we look at VR.\" For the first time, SteamOS is on an Arm chip in the Frame. It can wirelessly connect to your rig to play your VR games, but also play non-VR games through the same controllers. It's all hitting the right notes for me. However, in my excitement for the new headset, I spotted a single note in the specs sheet that dampens it somewhat: Mono …",

That brings us to this Vulcan II TKL , a full-size, tenkeyless board whose design and feature list will be like putting on comfy old shoes to anyone who tried the previous Vulcan, and whose Titan HS mechanical switches offer a really distinctive, linear sensation. Appraising gaming keyboards right now is tough, because it's become extremely specialised. Manufacturers are broadening their ranges to cater to as many preferred tactile sensations as possible, and weighing one up against another really does involve a lot of personal preference. That said, there are a few empirical factors like build quality that help the plight of poor, put-upon reviews like myself. In this case, the Vulcan II TKL makes a great first impression.

With plenty of details on what's inside this machine, and Valve's tactics for the Steam Deck , we have most of the information we need to take an educated guess at the price. We don't know anything more than we've already said in our various stories on Valve's Linux box.

If one of your squad members places themself right in the corner of the door and another raider jumps on their head, then it'll clip them through the locked door. Once the person who clipped inside can then open the door to let the rest of their squad inside. And then voila, you can all get some high-level loot without the hassle of bringing in a key card.

Where to find androids for the In My Image quest in Arc Raiders You're looking for bodies like this scattered all around Stella Montis (Image credit: Embark Studios) There aren't three specific androids you need to find in Stella Montis . In fact, androids are effectively just loot containers that look like corpses, pictured in the image above. You will have seen these in …",

But I shouldn't have underestimated the Arc Raiders community, as we've completed the task in record time. After just 38 hours, Stella Montis has been unlocked as the community rallied together last night to shovel an obscene amount of resources into the required communal pot. Just for some context, by this point yesterday, the event was more or less only 2% complete. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Now the next stage of the community event is up, and it gives players more chances to earn new loot and cosmetics. Staking Our Claim requires players to actually go to Stella Montis and make a dent there against arcs and maybe even other raiders. The only real goal is to earn XP; it doesn't matter how you do it. 100 XP equals 1 merit, and there are 24 milestones for players to check in and get loot at, with the last prize sitting at a pretty 3,600 merits.

Do you jump on the Hall effect bandwagon to ensure you're bang on trend, and able to deliver that customisable actuation and rapid trigger response all the aspiring pros desire? Or do you stick with tried and tested mechanical keys, which still represent the vast majority of the gaming keeb market but don't offer the same customisation or response times as those analogue switch whippersnappers? Razer's latest V4 incarnation of the BlackWidow—ahem, sorry, BlackWidow Low-Profile Tenkeyless Hyperspeed —sticks in old-school mechanical territory, but pairs that ol' reliable tactical switch feel with low-profile keys that have a shorter travel from starting position to the bottom of the keypress. It can be used wired or wireless, has three control buttons and a clickable volume roller, and the stated 980-hour battery life is impressive enough. But the real crux of this product is the feel of the keypress. Which means it's a very subjective object to review.

Valve has introduced a number of new branches to its hardware ecosystem, including the aforementioned PC-for-the-TV device. But who is it for? And is Valve really angling for a slice of the console market? While we know the Steam Machine will release early next year, we don't yet know how much it will go for—but I'm feeling hopeful it could be an affordable, accessible option for the PC gaming-curious. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: PC gaming is an expensive hobby. After the not small upfront cost of building your very first rig, there's the regular rhythm of pricey hardware upgrades (to say nothing at all about the cost of repairs and replacement parts). So, could the Steam Machine corner the market of folks curious about the power and customisability of PC gaming, but who still want to hit the ground running when it comes to gaming? Given that the bog-standard PS5 now costs $550 and the price of a 1TB Xbox X has climbed…",

According to the WSJ, the chips were bought from Nvidia by Silicon Valley-based AI server manufacturer Aivres , which operates under a parent company that is one-third-owned by Inspur, a Chinese company that was added to the US government's trade blacklist in 2023, over claims that it worked on Chinese military supercomputing projects.

With that being said, Peak's newest patch update has decided to encourage players to continue doing this by buffing one of the game's most exploited items - the Scout Cannon. These updates mean the Scout Cannon can now launch zombies, which is perfect for anyone struggling to make their way through the Roots biome. The weight of the item has also been reduced from six to four, which is pretty huge news, as one of the sole reasons I don't carry it around is because of how heavy it is and how much stamina I lose when doing so. Outside of this, some smaller tweaks like making the cannon easier to jump out of and the forced ragdoll time being reduced have been made, too.

Below, I'll go over all the Mastery Camos you can earn in Black Ops 7 and what you have to do to get them in each mode. Buckle up, because it's a lot of work.

This will introduce new quests, visitors, furniture, and the most exciting part: at least two new avatars for your character. That's right, you're no longer limited to the set of animals you can pick from at the start of the game, we're getting a pair of amphibians. The two characters shown in the reveal are an axolotl and a frog, and much like every other critter you can pick as your playable character, you'll still be able to customise them with the colour palettes you've unlocked while exploring the island. Which is fantastic news as it'll take a lot for me to change my current pastel pink bunny. On the topic of customisation, a few of the patch notes also share that tweaks have been made to certain clothing items. Clipping issues for the Monster Beanie, Scholastic Berets, My Melody Pirate Hat, and the My Sweet Piano outfit have now been resolved, meaning no matter the shape of your character you'll be able to make the most of your wardrobe.

Since Enshrouded's water is simulated in real time, you can dig canals for irrigating crops or powering new crafting stations, and you can move water around in containers to fill your own lakes and ponds. There are even waterproof walls included in the update if you want to build an underwater base—and something tells me you do. Just be careful: if you remove the wrong block down there, water will immediately begin flooding your submerged home. You're not the only one moving into Veilwater Basin. A lizard-like race called Drak are also elbowing their way into the region, and not only are they strong swimmers but they can use weapons underwater—unlike you. You might w…",

He's much more pleased with how things turned out in The Witcher 3 , which did justice to what he calls \"the emotional aspects of the characters from the books.\" After two games in which Yennefer is barely mentioned and relegated to flashbacks, she drops into The Witcher 3 like a bomb to upset the cozy relationship you probably built with Triss in the second game. The ex Geralt never properly ended things with, and the canon love interest as book readers will tell you (it's me, I'm book readers), she complicates Geralt's love life and forces him to belatedly grow up—which feels thematically appropriate, as he retakes his place as Ciri's father figure over the course of the game. Yet that element wasn't always part of The Witcher 3. As Badowski says, \"It wasn't [there] from the beginning, but at some point we understood that this lack of kind of conflict, personal conflict—of course, there's Ciri—but there was a lack of something .\" As soon as someone suggested the idea of making players c…",

Far down the ladder from these decisions is Eleventh Hour Games, the developer behind Last Epoch, which Krafton acquired in July . The timing couldn't have been worse as it happened right after the founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds were unceremoniously fired for what they claim was a move to avoid paying a $250 million earnout. At the time, EHG founder Judd Cobler told fans of the budding action RPG that having a corporate owner would only benefit the game in the long run by giving them access to more resources and employees. Fans of the game were understandably skeptical about how the buyout would impact the game.

Instead of just one Alien, it gave us a bunch of different types of aliens, including a weird eyeball creature that is both horrifying and yet kinda cuddly? Instead of a single android, standard for Alien movies, it also featured a cyborg and several synthetic people with human minds transplanted into them.

Petersen joined id during the development of Doom in 1993, working on several of the game's levels and designing more for Doom 2. He also worked on Quake before leaving the studio in mid-1997, about a year after Romero's exit. That makes for a good bit of overlap, though of course Romero was with id from the beginning, having co-founded the studio in 1991. Romero, notably, has talked about having hyperthymesia , which he credits for giving him a vivid memory. I don't know if his recall is perfect , but each time Petersen trots out an id…",

    "body": "I like strategy games, but they start to lose me as they grow increasingly complex to the point of near-impenetrability. That's largely kept me away from grand strategy and 4X games, which tend to offer the richest sandboxes to the most committed players, occasionally at the cost of accessibility to newcomers. The only series in the style that's truly won my heart is Age of Wonders, the fourth of which you can try for free this weekend until Monday, Nov. 17. If you're not familiar, Age of Wonders marries the deep strategy of 4X to turn-based tactical RPG gameplay. It also grounds a lot of the map-painting in intuitive, tangible roleplay scenarios: You don't play a faceless nation, but a customizable ruler and culture, gathering magical artifacts, schools of magic, skills, and provinces as you explore the world. You can play as anything from classic fantasy dwarfs to gothic, power-mad molemen, and territory is won with turn-based battles made up of your custom troops. In his review , online editor Fraser Brown said Age of Wonders 4 \"demands to be played over and over,\" and I concur. It's also a great hangout game with asynchronous multiplayer that can be played cooperatively or com…",

    "body": "Well, this is a strange one. Just minutes before it was set to deliver its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year, Ubisoft mashed the brakes on the whole thing, postponing the release of its results to an unspecified future date. The company also requested that European exchange Euronext halt trading of the company's shares and bonds from November 14 until the publication of its results. No reason for the postponement or trading halt was provided, but these things are rarely the result of good news. They often arise from events like unexpected major news announcements or regulatory problems that can have the potential to trigger panic selling. (Image credit: Ubisoft) There's no sign that's the case here, but Ubisoft is in a unique and precarious situation right now. The company's share price is in the toilet, and it recently entered into a deal with Tencent to establish a new \"creative house\" called Vantage Studios that will assume control of the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six properties. Leading up to that, though, was something of a low-key power struggle : Tencent wanted to assert more control over Ubisoft, but the founding Guillemot family …",

The Security Breach skill, one of the final abilities unlocked on the Survival branch of the skill tree, allows raiders exclusive access to special locked containers on all maps. Security Breach quickly became the most popular progression path in Arc Raiders after the community realized those padlocked containers were by far the most reliable source of rare and legendary guns, equipment, and blueprints. If you knew where to find them, a typical Security Breach raider could fill their backpack with purple drops and then extract without ever putting themselves in danger. As of this morning, Embark has stealthily nerfed it. \"We adjusted the security lockers because they were over-providing valuable items,\" Embark representative Ossen said in a reply on the Arc Raiders Discord server. In a later post, Ossen clarified that the studio didn't mean to sneak the nerf into today's patch, but mistakenly left it out. \"In the notes earlier today, we missed the Security Locker drop rate changes.

If you're looking for more virtual action in a decidedly high fantasy-themed package, you might have an unlikely savior on the way: Snoozy Kazoo, the team behind the Turnip Boy games. Enter Rizz Dungeon: Skeleton Key to My Heart , a first-person dungeon crawler announced today.

Unlike those games, you're not much of an adventurer—instead, you're a \"hopeless weakling flirt\" there to romance monster girls by \"rizzing them up,\" according to the Steam page .
