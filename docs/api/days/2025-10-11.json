Recently, a user on the Silksong speedrunning Discord found a glitch so powerful that it might lead to a lot more discoveries in the coming days. And it turns you into a nearly unkillable god as a side effect. YouTube user Kilroy Was Here has returned with another glitch that changes protagonist Hornet's life forever. After locking her in jail and smacking one of its toughest bosses to death, Kilroy found a new trick that untethers her from the constraints of gravity and the physical world. Silkeaters are little grubs you can crush to retrieve the stuff you leave behind when you die in Silksong. They're usually just a convenient way to replenish your silk—which is used for healing and special attacks—without having to get back to where you fell. But Wuffie, a user on the speedrunning Discord, discovered that popping a silkeater in the middle of an animation at the end of a boss fight causes something very strange to happen. Althoug…",

The Control spinoff shooter FBC: Firebreak stumbled badly at launch, putting up a peak concurrent player count on Steam of just under 2,000 on release day and quickly slumping to under 100 less than a month later. Remedy fired out some quick patches and committed to more significant changes, the first of which went live near the end of September . That sparked a small bump in the concurrent player count, but it quickly slumped back down to double-digit numbers. Remedy's next quarterly financial report is set for October 29, but it's not waiting until then to deliver the bad news. \"In its 2025 half-year financial report, Remedy reported that FBC: Firebreak’s launch-phase consumer sales underperformed,\" the studio said in today's update . \"After the launch, the company rapidly developed the game based on player feedback and released multiple updates. \"On September 29, Remedy released the first Major Update tit…",

For hours now, Battlefield 6 owners who bought the game through EA's official storefront have been locked out of all modes due to a strange entitlement bug. EA is working on a fix, but that's not good enough for Battlefield boss Vince Zampella. In a reply to a spurned fan on X , Zampella gave the sort of recommendation that any reasonable PC gamer would give in this situation: \"Can you refund and buy on Steam?\" Surely yes, they can, but it's a little surprising to hear that from Mr. EA. \"I have yelled about EA App people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?\" he asked in a post higher in the thread. (Image credit: Vince Zampella via X) Is Vince asking us who he should be yelling at to fix this problem? Surely he'd know better than us, but maybe he's just trying to make it as clear as possible that he's miffed. At this point, everyone on this big blue marble knows how badly the EA App sucks. It's clunky, glitchy, and has one of the worst friend lists in launcher history. There's no good reason to burden yourself by opening the devil…",

That's a pretty pronounced open square, and it immediately sparked speculation in the replies that a new game is incoming, and hope among most that it's a new Wolfenstein. I would certainly join that chorus.

Blizzard will unlock player housing for everyone, whether you've preordered the Midnight expansion or not, to test on the PTR starting October 13. Anything you build on the PTR won't carry over to the live game when early access to player housing launches in December, but you'll have a few days to see if you can create the house of your dreams. I've played with some of the tools on the Midnight alpha build and they're already surprisingly robust. You can drop tables and paintings and chandeliers just about anywhere, and every object can be rotated and resized easily. Walls and floors can be reskinned with a few clicks and it'll even remember your most recent choices for when you add new preset rooms to your pad. Housing will require owning Midnight when it fully drops, but this is your opportunity to try it for free. WoW PTRs don't require a subscription; lapsed accounts can download it on the Battle.net launcher as soon as it's live. Completely new players, however, will need to make a PTR account following the steps on Blizzard's website . In her preview of WoW: Midnight's alpha …",

It turns out that an application on Steam can't be both a mod, which Team Fortress 2 Classic is, and a demo, which it was about to be, at the same time. You might think somebody would have flagged this ahead of time but, well, no. \"Unfortunately, this was not caught by anyone at Eminoma or at Valve until last Saturday, after initial reviews hadn't flagged it as an issue and gave us the mistaken belief that we were clear to ship,\" the dev team wrote. The good news is that the mod is not at risk of being derailed: Eminoma said it's \"still very much on track for full release,\" and that the effort to get everything ready for the cancelled open beta means it's \"probably in a better spot than we would have been if we never attempted this in the first place.\" But there is also the possibility that something may have to change—specifically, the name of the mod.

This time around, he's even crediting it with inspiring Metal Gear and Death Stranding. Expo '70 was organised around the theme of \"Progress and Harmony for Mankind\", and featured participation from 76 countries and 32 organisations. It had a theme song, Haruo Minami’s 'Sekai no kuni kara konnichiwa' (Hello from all over the world), which Kojima is a little obsessive about: the song repeats the \"hello\" refrain many times as well as talking about humanity \"holding hands\" across borders. It's actually a bit of a bop . \"When the Expo opened, I had just finished elementary school,\" writes Kojima . \"I was able to visit the site many times. I went there dozens of times [...] At the Soviet Pavilion, I waited in line for over two hours, with a line stretching around the perimeter.

Original story follows: It's Battlefield 6 day, and virtual warfighters are flocking to the front to dutifully ignore their squadmates' cries for revives and crash the first helicopter they enter. But as all those hundreds of thousands of launch day players arrive, some who purchased the game through the EA app are being denied deployment. On the Battlefield subreddit , the Steam discussion forums , and on X , users who bought Battlefield 6 from EA's launcher say that after launching the game—and sitting through the launch day login queue—they're unable to play either multiplayer or the campaign. Even after multiple reinstall attempts, Battlefield 6 will insist that those users are \"missing\" necessary content, or that they must \"purchase to play\"—seemingly indicating that …",

There is no more perfect day-one demonstration of what Portal can do than this surprisingly good remake of Call of Duty 4 Shipment by game dev Matavatar , who had a working version of the map up a day before Battlefield 6 was even live (EA released the Portal editor a bit early). I played a few minutes of Matavatar's Shipment in a server someone had going and, yep, they pretty much nailed it. Because of how Portal works at the moment, the map itself was actually suspended in the air somewhere in the skybox of Operation Firestorm, which is giving early Portal creations a Halo Forge-y feel (which I mean in a complimentary way). It's kind of wild that EA is letting people not only host custom maps from the jump, but even earn XP from playing in them.

Take a bow Saint Riot, a streamer who mainly focuses on FromSoftware games but has taken a break with the (excellent) remake of Final Fantasy Tactics, and dared to ask the big question: do chocobos believe in god? Well… do they? To briefly explain: one of the character stats in FFT is faith, which is a double-edged sword that measures a character's faith in the divine as a percentage. A higher faith stat means their magic attacks are more effective, but they also take more damage from magic. The important thing here though is that, if a character's Faith score hits 95 and stays there, that character will leave your party to go find god. One more thing. The Orator class can use an ability called Beast Tongue to take control of a monster (such as a chocobo) and use it in battle, and the creature will level up.

Okay, to be fair, Timmins wasn't quite as foreboding as that, but he did caution players against using this (or any other) dialogue skipping mod when they brought it to his attention. Not because he's precious about you hearing his game's lovely words, but because \"skipping dialog could lead to broken mission states that might not be recoverable.\" Turns out all that nattering is holding something up, and that something is important.

The official website says the WowCube is \"the most advanced toy you can gift\", claims it is \"10 x better\" than the standard Rubik's Cube—which you'd expect, given it's 20 x more expensive. Alongside this, the website is pitching a WowClub Pass, which comes with the Mindhub AI app, a monthly games catalogue, extra widgets for the cube, an app for building apps, and member discounts on future cubes. It sounds like Rubik's is all but shipping a battle pass with this new electronic device. This is not the first WowCube to exist. Cubios (the company behind it) announced a WowCube before at the same price point, but this is a collaboration with Spin Master, which paid $50 million for the Rubik's Cube brand at the start of 2021. It seems like the basic cube idea is the same (slap 24 screens to a Rubik's Cube). I paid $200 for Panic's Playdate , a tiny yellow device that let…",

As I write this, the game sits at a current and all-time peak of 521,000 concurrent players. I think most of them are in a queue. Queues, like hell, do the numbers. This is quite impressive, and I imagine is just the kind of thing that DICE and, less salubriously, EA wanted to see when it hit the big red launch button on its latest entry in the series. I wasn't kidding when I said I think most of them are in a queue. At time of writing, Battlefield community hotspots mostly consist of competitive queue-posting. 'There are 417,000 people ahead of me!' boasts one . 'There are 458,000 ahead of me!' ripostes another . The good news is that queues appear to be moving quick. It's no surprise.

But in case you've wondered about some of the broader design choices that went into the last couple of generations plus the upcoming one, Intel's just answered why these CPU cores are the way they are. Well, at least in one respect, that is, this is being why simultaneous multithreading (SMT) was abandoned. In a recent interview with Chips and Cheese , Intel's lead x86 CPU architect Stephen Robinson tells interviewer George Cozma that \"SMT isn't necessarily as valuable\" once you add hybrid cores into the mix. Intel has been using hybrid cores—a mix of P-Cores for heavy workloads and E-Cores for lighter ones—for the past few years, ever since 12th Gen Alder Lake processors. Initially, these had multithreading. But the most recent Lunar Lake mobile and Alder Lake desktop chips—the first ones other than Meteor Lake to use the 'Core Ultra' nomenclature—ditched SMT altogether. This trend is continuing with upcoming Panther Lake processors: they won't have SMT. Robinson explains that…",

And yet, Sawyer believes job security for himself as well as other devs is worse than ever before despite his current position, as well as shipping so many well-respected titles over the years, \"In 26 years, I’ve never really felt secure in a job. Even now. Less so now, actually\", he tells the audience during a keynote at GCAP , a game development conference in Melbourne, Australia. \"That’s actually pretty messed up\" he adds, almost as though he’s realising it upon saying it out loud.

It allowed game devs to take many of the sentiments and mechanics used in DnD and translate them to videogame experiences. It allowed a lot of people to have these kinds of adventures for the first time, especially when good Dungeon Masters are always so hard to find. \"The reason we stopped making Infinity Engine games was because retailers told us no one wanted to buy them,\" says Josh Sawyer—who now serves as Obsidian's studio design director but cut his teeth working on games like Icewind Dale—during his keynote speech at GCAP 2025 in Melbourne, Australia. \"We asked if we could see the research and they basically told us to trust them\" he adds to sad chuckles from the crowd.…",

AI code review platform Graphite has published a blog detailing its use of \"dogfooding\" to help develop its onboarding process, a particularly ugly term that apparently equates to \"being forced to eat your own dogfood\" . Essentially, you make the product, you should be forced to use it—which Graphite apparently enacts by randomly deleting employee accounts on a daily basis, a process it refers to as \"onboarding roulette\". The facepalms, they are not big enough. Anyway, the whole idea is to test the onboarding process for its AI code review software, a traditionally difficult problem to solve due to the userbase being your primary test subjects. Fear not, however, as apparently dogfooding is the way forward. As co-founder and CTO Greg Foster explains: \"Our solution at Graphite has been to run a roulette script, randomly deleting one of our engineers' Graphite accounts every day at 9 a.m. We don’t just reset onboarding—we delete their account, tokens, configured filters, uploaded gifs, and more.\" \"Isn't that frustrating?

The PW5A3 is certainly a strong early option, alongside the SGX , but it wasn't my cup of tea at first. With some smart attachment choices, this SMG grew on me a ton for mid-range maps like Iberian Offensive and Siege of Cairo.

It's my most-used weapon so far, and I wouldn't have it any other way. If you played the beta back in August, then this might not come as a surprise to you; the M4A1 was arguably the best gun then, and it still holds strong despite some changes since.

It's certainly one way to escape the rat race of TTK escalation and, if you're a rifle lover, the poor performance of DMRs relative to absolute murder machine SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines. Snipers can set up their own little spot and plink away, enjoying the atmosphere of the battlefield while ideally not drawing too much attention. The best BF6 M2010 ESR loadout is very different to its other weapon counterparts, where recoil control is one of the most important things. Instead, this setup focuses on adding handy tools to the rifle that speed up round rechambering, but also reduce weapon sway so you can land a long-range shot with more precision. Some of the best M2010 ESR attachments aren't available until a relatively high mastery (such as the DLC Bolt that allows scoped-in round rechambering), so you'll have plenty of points to spend as you're levelling to experiment with attachments either way.

With so many weapons to unlock, both through career ranks and assignments, it's a no-brainer to sort the wheat from the chaff to find out the best guns . So, I've put every weapon to the test, including playing around with attachments, to help you out in the field.

Well, it's got a whole lot of bullets for one. While your opponent's mag might run dry quickly, you'll still be blasting away.

The developers have made much noise about prioritising optimisation over best-in-class graphics , including eschewing ray traced lighting for a traditional baked-in approach, and the minimum specs list the dusty-old RTX 2060 and RX 5600 XT as all that's needed for 1080p 30 fps gameplay. Which, given some of the releases so far this year, must come as a welcome relief for those of you running less than top-end hardware. I've had a chance to perform some early testing of Battlefield 6's performance on two of Nvidia's mid-to-upper-mid range GPUs, the RTX 4070 and RTX 5070 Ti , and I've got even better news for you—not only does the game look great, but it seems mercifully light on modern graphics cards at everything but the very top setting. Which is appropriately named \"Overkill\". Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. Jumping into the Battlefield 6 graphics settings screen reveals two preset menus for Performance and Graphics Quality, both of which default to Auto.

Shared to the official PlayStation YouTube account , AMD's senior vice president and general manager, Jack Huynh, had a brief conversation with Mark Cerny, the lead system architect for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. They talk about future tech for PlayStation and the advancements AMD is making with its RDNA architecture to support that. AMD has been a long-time collaborator with Sony, with the PS4 using an AMD Jaguar CPU, and the PS5 housing an 8-core AMD Zen 2 CPU. Intel was reportedly in the running to develop the PS6's APU, but disputes over profit margins allegedly pushed them out of the competition . Both the PS5 and PS5 Pro are built on RDNA 2 architecture, with the latter landing \" somewhere between RDNA 2 and RDNA 3. \" There are three central updates shared in this presentation.

Willows are expensive and finicky about being planted near water, while the spruce don't give a damn where they grow, but produce less of the magic juice I need to cast spells and summon goblins and vodyanoy. Once I'm done with a night's planting and summoning I press the button to begin the day, and waves of humans with axes and bows start marching in.

First things first: You may be thinking that this is not an anniversary of any sort for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which came out on December 9, 2024. And you would be correct. But it is the 15th anniversary of developer MachineGames, and that's a pretty big deal in its own right. So, to the update : The New Game+ mode will unlock once you've completed the game, enabling you to replay the entire adventure with all your collected and unlocked Adventure Books, as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and medicine bottles from your previous playthrough. You will of course be a lot more powerful all kitted out like that, so MachineGames suggests increasing the difficulty for the NG+ playthrough, but you do you—as long as Nazis are getting socked in the chops, all is well. As a reward for your efforts, completing the Great Circle in NG+ will unlock an all-new ending sequence that rolls after the credits.

There just aren't that many left that haven't already been used. It's not great news for us, either. What the hell else am I supposed to do for a few minutes every morning: exercise, enrich myself with literature, or have a conversation with a loved one? At least there's a little brightness in our grim future. Fast-forward from 2027 to the year 2077, and it looks like we'll still be able to play a bit of Wordle between our visits to the ripperdoc for some new chrome. It's all thanks to a mod by MisterChedda called Gonkle for Cyberpunk 2077 ( via RPS ), which gives you a suspiciously Wordle-like word game for you to play on your in-game phone. And even better, it's not so strict on the words you can use, fully embracing all that gritty and silly Night City slang. Choom isn't just a cool thing to call your buddy, it's also an answer in Gonkle. \"Every 24 hours (specifically midnight UTC), you'll get a new puzzle delivered as a text message on your phone—same word for…",
