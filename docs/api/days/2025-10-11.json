    "body": "Hollow Knight: Silksong continues to get picked apart as players try to find every little secret Team Cherry hid inside of it over the course of its long development. That also includes the things it probably didn't intend to be in there, like glitches. Recently, a user on the Silksong speedrunning Discord found a glitch so powerful that it might lead to a lot more discoveries in the coming days. And it turns you into a nearly unkillable god as a side effect. YouTube user Kilroy Was Here has returned with another glitch that changes protagonist Hornet's life forever. After locking her in jail and smacking one of its toughest bosses to death, Kilroy found a new trick that untethers her from the constraints of gravity and the physical world. Silkeaters are little grubs you can crush to retrieve the stuff you leave behind when you die in Silksong. They're usually just a convenient way to replenish your silk‚Äîwhich is used for healing and special attacks‚Äîwithout having to get back to where you fell. But Wuffie, a user on the speedrunning Discord, discovered that popping a silkeater in the middle of an animation at the end of a boss fight causes something very strange to happen. Althoug‚Ä¶",

The Control spinoff shooter FBC: Firebreak stumbled badly at launch, putting up a peak concurrent player count on Steam of just under 2,000 on release day and quickly slumping to under 100 less than a month later. Remedy fired out some quick patches and committed to more significant changes, the first of which went live near the end of September . That sparked a small bump in the concurrent player count, but it quickly slumped back down to double-digit numbers. Remedy's next quarterly financial report is set for October 29, but it's not waiting until then to deliver the bad news. \"In its 2025 half-year financial report, Remedy reported that FBC: Firebreak‚Äôs launch-phase consumer sales underperformed,\" the studio said in today's update . \"After the launch, the company rapidly developed the game based on player feedback and released multiple updates. \"On September 29, Remedy released the first Major Update tit‚Ä¶",

For hours now, Battlefield 6 owners who bought the game through EA's official storefront have been locked out of all modes due to a strange entitlement bug. EA is working on a fix, but that's not good enough for Battlefield boss Vince Zampella. In a reply to a spurned fan on X , Zampella gave the sort of recommendation that any reasonable PC gamer would give in this situation: \"Can you refund and buy on Steam?\" Surely yes, they can, but it's a little surprising to hear that from Mr. EA. \"I have yelled about EA App people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?\" he asked in a post higher in the thread. (Image credit: Vince Zampella via X) Is Vince asking us who he should be yelling at to fix this problem? Surely he'd know better than us, but maybe he's just trying to make it as clear as possible that he's miffed. At this point, everyone on this big blue marble knows how badly the EA App sucks. It's clunky, glitchy, and has one of the worst friend lists in launcher history. There's no good reason to burden yourself by opening the devil‚Ä¶",

    "body": "One of the biggest features coming to World of Warcraft will be available to try for free next week. Blizzard will unlock player housing for everyone, whether you've preordered the Midnight expansion or not, to test on the PTR starting October 13. Anything you build on the PTR won't carry over to the live game when early access to player housing launches in December, but you'll have a few days to see if you can create the house of your dreams. I've played with some of the tools on the Midnight alpha build and they're already surprisingly robust. You can drop tables and paintings and chandeliers just about anywhere, and every object can be rotated and resized easily. Walls and floors can be reskinned with a few clicks and it'll even remember your most recent choices for when you add new preset rooms to your pad. Housing will require owning Midnight when it fully drops, but this is your opportunity to try it for free. WoW PTRs don't require a subscription; lapsed accounts can download it on the Battle.net launcher as soon as it's live. Completely new players, however, will need to make a PTR account following the steps on Blizzard's website . In her preview of WoW: Midnight's alpha ‚Ä¶",

    "body": "Just over a week after announcing an October open beta for the Steam edition of Team Fortress 2 Classic , the throwback version of Valve's famed team-based shooter, developer Eminoma has an update: Never mind . It turns out that an application on Steam can't be both a mod, which Team Fortress 2 Classic is, and a demo, which it was about to be, at the same time. You might think somebody would have flagged this ahead of time but, well, no. \"Unfortunately, this was not caught by anyone at Eminoma or at Valve until last Saturday, after initial reviews hadn't flagged it as an issue and gave us the mistaken belief that we were clear to ship,\" the dev team wrote. The good news is that the mod is not at risk of being derailed: Eminoma said it's \"still very much on track for full release,\" and that the effort to get everything ready for the cancelled open beta means it's \"probably in a better spot than we would have been if we never attempted this in the first place.\" But there is also the possibility that something may have to change‚Äîspecifically, the name of the mod. The team explained: \"Valve has asked us to ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, due to concerns that the ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà is too ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚Ä¶",

Kojima has often touched on this event in his writings, and the impact that his repeated visits had on his young mind. This time around, he's even crediting it with inspiring Metal Gear and Death Stranding. Expo '70 was organised around the theme of \"Progress and Harmony for Mankind\", and featured participation from 76 countries and 32 organisations. It had a theme song, Haruo Minami‚Äôs 'Sekai no kuni kara konnichiwa' (Hello from all over the world), which Kojima is a little obsessive about: the song repeats the \"hello\" refrain many times as well as talking about humanity \"holding hands\" across borders. It's actually a bit of a bop . \"When the Expo opened, I had just finished elementary school,\" writes Kojima . \"I was able to visit the site many times. I went there dozens of times [...] At the Soviet Pavilion, I waited in line for over two hours, with a line stretching around the perimeter. Unfortunately, the American Pavilion, where I was hoping to see the 'moon rock', was too crowded, and I missed it.\" Remember that m‚Ä¶",

Battlefield 6 is checking both of those boxes at launch with Portal, a web tool and SDK that lets people fire up persistent custom games and create new game modes. There is no more perfect day-one demonstration of what Portal can do than this surprisingly good remake of Call of Duty 4 Shipment by game dev Matavatar , who had a working version of the map up a day before Battlefield 6 was even live (EA released the Portal editor a bit early). I played a few minutes of Matavatar's Shipment in a server someone had going and, yep, they pretty much nailed it. Because of how Portal works at the moment, the map itself was actually suspended in the air somewhere in the skybox of Operation Firestorm, which is giving early Portal creations a Halo Forge-y feel (which I mean in a complimentary way). It's kind of wild that EA is letting people not only host custom maps from the jump, but even earn XP from playing in them. That means right now, you can hop in a Shipment 24/7 playlist (which already exists) and enjoy a mode that Call of Duty players usually have to beg ‚Ä¶",

    "body": "The DRS-IAR straddles the line between an assault rifle and LMG in Battlefield 6 , and it struggles to be the best of either at first. The default attachments, namely a 3.5x scope and nothing in the way of recoil control, really sell this weapon short. With the best BF6 DRS-IAR loadout , though, this LMG is a monster. Since it brings the raw stopping power of an LMG with the faster, more versatile handling of an assault rifle, the DRS is great for almost all of Battlefield 6's maps. The main drawback is its incredible kick, but build it right, and maybe it'll become your favourite weapon too. Best DRS-IAR loadout in Battlefield 6 (Image credit: EA) You should use the following DRS-IAR build: Muzzle: Double-Port Brake (10) Barrel: Light 16.5\" Fluted (20) Underbarrel: Ribbed Stubby (30) Magazine: 30RND Magazine (5) Ammunition: Standard (5) Scope: Mini Flex 1.00x (10) or RO-M 1.75x (10) Accessory: 50MW Blue (20) This thing kicks like a mule, so first things first, you'll want the Double-Port Brake and Ribbed Stubby foregrip to control the recoil. These are unlocked at Mastery 13 and 21, respectively, so use the Single-Port Brake and Alloy Vertical grip until that point. These aren't ‚Ä¶",

And now one enterprising player has proven that there is a chocobo god. Take a bow Saint Riot, a streamer who mainly focuses on FromSoftware games but has taken a break with the (excellent) remake of Final Fantasy Tactics, and dared to ask the big question: do chocobos believe in god? Well‚Ä¶ do they? To briefly explain: one of the character stats in FFT is faith, which is a double-edged sword that measures a character's faith in the divine as a percentage. A higher faith stat means their magic attacks are more effective, but they also take more damage from magic. The important thing here though is that, if a character's Faith score hits 95 and stays there, that character will leave your party to go find god. One more thing. The Orator class can use an ability called Beast Tongue to take control of a monster (such as a chocobo) and use it in battle, and the creature will level up. So over to Saint Riot: \"Have you ever wondered what would happen if you had Beast Tongue and got a monster u‚Ä¶",

That's not me telling you that, it's Graeme Timmins, Gearbox bigwig and creative director on Borderlands 4. Okay, to be fair, Timmins wasn't quite as foreboding as that, but he did caution players against using this (or any other) dialogue skipping mod when they brought it to his attention. Not because he's precious about you hearing his game's lovely words, but because \"skipping dialog could lead to broken mission states that might not be recoverable.\" Turns out all that nattering is holding something up, and that something is important. While other games might have dialogue-skip functions with hardly a problem, the way BL4 works means that \"This request is way more involved and riskier that it appears on the surface with how dialog is integrated within our mission system\". In other words, not triggering some key bit of mission info in dialogue might leave you in mission limbo forevermore. \"Don‚Ä¶",

The Rubik's WowCube comes with 24 LCD screens and an AI-based application that tracks the time you've spent playing with it, alongside the number of twists you've made. The official website says the WowCube is \"the most advanced toy you can gift\", claims it is \"10 x better\" than the standard Rubik's Cube‚Äîwhich you'd expect, given it's 20 x more expensive. Alongside this, the website is pitching a WowClub Pass, which comes with the Mindhub AI app, a monthly games catalogue, extra widgets for the cube, an app for building apps, and member discounts on future cubes. It sounds like Rubik's is all but shipping a battle pass with this new electronic device. This is not the first WowCube to exist. Cubios (the company behind it) announced a WowCube before at the same price point, but this is a collaboration with Spin Master, which paid $50 million for the Rubik's Cube brand at the start of 2021.

    "body": "Intel recently spilled the beans on its upcoming Panther Lake CPU architecture , which seems to be an iterative improvement over previous designs, plus the promise of being built on a new process node, 18A. But in case you've wondered about some of the broader design choices that went into the last couple of generations plus the upcoming one, Intel's just answered why these CPU cores are the way they are. Well, at least in one respect, that is, this is being why simultaneous multithreading (SMT) was abandoned. In a recent interview with Chips and Cheese , Intel's lead x86 CPU architect Stephen Robinson tells interviewer George Cozma that \"SMT isn't necessarily as valuable\" once you add hybrid cores into the mix. Intel has been using hybrid cores‚Äîa mix of P-Cores for heavy workloads and E-Cores for lighter ones‚Äîfor the past few years, ever since 12th Gen Alder Lake processors. Initially, these had multithreading. But the most recent Lunar Lake mobile and Alder Lake desktop chips‚Äîthe first ones other than Meteor Lake to use the 'Core Ultra' nomenclature‚Äîditched SMT altogether. This trend is continuing with upcoming Panther Lake processors: they won't have SMT. Robinson explains that‚Ä¶",

Sawyer had his first position in 1999 working at Black Isle Studios, and now serves as studio design director at Obsidian, where he led development on games like Fallout: New Vegas and Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. And yet, Sawyer believes job security for himself as well as other devs is worse than ever before despite his current position, as well as shipping so many well-respected titles over the years, \"In 26 years, I‚Äôve never really felt secure in a job. Even now. Less so now, actually\", he tells the audience during a keynote at GCAP , a game development conference in Melbourne, Australia. \"That‚Äôs actually pretty messed up\" he adds, almost as though he‚Äôs realising it upon saying it out loud. The games industry is a vastly different space than it was 26 years ago when Sawyer began. Back then, teams of developers for AAA games were usually between 15-40 people, with almost everyone branching out across different skills and, more often than not, undergoing constant crunch to deliver.

The Infinity Engine was used to power isometric roleplaying games like the ones above. It allowed game devs to take many of the sentiments and mechanics used in DnD and translate them to videogame experiences. It allowed a lot of people to have these kinds of adventures for the first time, especially when good Dungeon Masters are always so hard to find. \"The reason we stopped making Infinity Engine games was because retailers told us no one wanted to buy them,\" says Josh Sawyer‚Äîwho now serves as Obsidian's studio design director but cut his teeth working on games like Icewind Dale‚Äîduring his keynote speech at GCAP 2025 in Melbourne, Australia. \"We asked if we could see the research and they basically told us to trust them\" he adds to sad chuckles from the crowd.‚Ä¶",

    "body": "I thought I'd heard every bit of corpo-speak going at this point in my career, but apparently I was wrong. AI code review platform Graphite has published a blog detailing its use of \"dogfooding\" to help develop its onboarding process, a particularly ugly term that apparently equates to \"being forced to eat your own dogfood\" . Essentially, you make the product, you should be forced to use it‚Äîwhich Graphite apparently enacts by randomly deleting employee accounts on a daily basis, a process it refers to as \"onboarding roulette\". The facepalms, they are not big enough. Anyway, the whole idea is to test the onboarding process for its AI code review software, a traditionally difficult problem to solve due to the userbase being your primary test subjects. Fear not, however, as apparently dogfooding is the way forward. As co-founder and CTO Greg Foster explains: \"Our solution at Graphite has been to run a roulette script, randomly deleting one of our engineers' Graphite accounts every day at 9 a.m. We don‚Äôt just reset onboarding‚Äîwe delete their account, tokens, configured filters, uploaded gifs, and more.\" \"Isn't that frustrating?

Just a few minutes into your first game, and you'll be well on your way to having the best M4A1 loadout , dominating close range and often outmatching even assault rifles at range (provided you're burst firing, of course). It's my most-used weapon so far, and I wouldn't have it any other way. If you played the beta back in August, then this might not come as a surprise to you; the M4A1 was arguably the best gun then, and it still holds strong despite some changes since. So, here's what attachments you need for a solid M4A1 build.

It's certainly one way to escape the rat race of TTK escalation and, if you're a rifle lover, the poor performance of DMRs relative to absolute murder machine SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines. Snipers can set up their own little spot and plink away, enjoying the atmosphere of the battlefield while ideally not drawing too much attention. The best BF6 M2010 ESR loadout is very different to its other weapon counterparts, where recoil control is one of the most important things. Instead, this setup focuses on adding handy tools to the rifle that speed up round rechambering, but also reduce weapon sway so you can land a long-range shot with more precision. Some of the best M2010 ESR attachments aren't available until a relatively high mastery (such as the DLC Bolt that allows scoped-in round rechambering), so you'll have plenty of points to spend as you're levelling to experiment with attachments either way.

It's a big improvement over the measly launch offerings of BF1, BF5, and BF2042, and it makes progression significantly more rewarding. With so many weapons to unlock, both through career ranks and assignments, it's a no-brainer to sort the wheat from the chaff to find out the best guns . So, I've put every weapon to the test, including playing around with attachments, to help you out in the field.

Thanks to its high fire rate and solid damage, the M4A1 is capable of dropping enemies blazingly fast. Now, you might think that these positives must mean the M4A1 is weak at range.

The best BF6 PW7A2 loadout takes advantage of this to create a flanking menace. While SMGs like the SGX and even the PW5A3 are capable of some pretty extraordinary feats at range, they pale in comparison to the PW7A2. Despite lower per-bullet damage, its significantly higher fire rate and unmatched handling more than make up for it. So, here's what you need.

The best BF6 L110 loadout is all about trying to control that torrent of projectiles, shackling the gun with some recoil control, while trying to keep it competitive with a fast aim down sight speed. The LMG is a bit of a weird gun in Battlefield 6, trumped at close range by SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines, but also at longer range by DMRs. So what does the L110 have going for it? Well, it's got a whole lot of bullets for one. While your opponent's mag might run dry quickly, you'll still be blasting away. If you can keep it accurate, it also has a decent TTK, especially if you manage to land headshots with the Hollow Point ammo I'm recommending.

Which, given some of the releases so far this year, must come as a welcome relief for those of you running less than top-end hardware.

Shared to the official PlayStation YouTube account , AMD's senior vice president and general manager, Jack Huynh, had a brief conversation with Mark Cerny, the lead system architect for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. They talk about future tech for PlayStation and the advancements AMD is making with its RDNA architecture to support that. AMD has been a long-time collaborator with Sony, with the PS4 using an AMD Jaguar CPU, and the PS5 housing an 8-core AMD Zen 2 CPU. Intel was reportedly in the running to develop the PS6's APU, but disputes over profit margins allegedly pushed them out of the competition . Both the PS5 and PS5 Pro are built on RDNA 2 architecture, with the latter landing \" somewhere between RDNA 2 and RDNA 3. \" There are three central updates shared in this presentation.

Fortunately, you can build an army of mythical creatures including satyrs and half-naked giants who rend and stomp loggers with abandon. Maybe you are a bit villain-adjacent. The demo I played at PAX Australia gave me a home tree and a single hut to protect, but let me grow more trees each night to produce the resources I needed to summon defenders. Willows are expensive and finicky about being planted near water, while the spruce don't give a damn where they grow, but produce less of the magic juice I need to cast spells and summon goblins and vodyanoy. Once I'm done with a night's planting and summoning I press the button to begin the day, and waves of humans with axes and bows start marching in. As well as just selecting a blob of monsters and right-clicking on them, I have access to a handful of spells. Meteors crush enemies, runes heal my guys, and kelpies‚Ä¶",

First things first: You may be thinking that this is not an anniversary of any sort for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which came out on December 9, 2024. And you would be correct. But it is the 15th anniversary of developer MachineGames, and that's a pretty big deal in its own right. So, to the update : The New Game+ mode will unlock once you've completed the game, enabling you to replay the entire adventure with all your collected and unlocked Adventure Books, as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and medicine bottles from your previous playthrough. You will of course be a lot more powerful all kitted out like that, so MachineGames suggests increasing the difficulty for the NG+ playthrough, but you do you‚Äîas long as Nazis are getting socked in the chops, all is well. As a reward for your efforts, completing the Great Circle in NG+ will unlock an all-new ending sequence that rolls after the credits.

There just aren't that many left that haven't already been used. It's not great news for us, either. What the hell else am I supposed to do for a few minutes every morning: exercise, enrich myself with literature, or have a conversation with a loved one? At least there's a little brightness in our grim future. Fast-forward from 2027 to the year 2077, and it looks like we'll still be able to play a bit of Wordle between our visits to the ripperdoc for some new chrome. It's all thanks to a mod by MisterChedda called Gonkle for Cyberpunk 2077 ( via RPS ), which gives you a suspiciously Wordle-like word game for you to play on your in-game phone. And even better, it's not so strict on the words you can use, fully embracing all that gritty and silly Night City slang. Choom isn't just a cool thing to call your buddy, it's also an answer in Gonkle. \"Every 24 hours (specifically midnight UTC), you'll get a new puzzle delivered as a text message on your phone‚Äîsame word for‚Ä¶",
