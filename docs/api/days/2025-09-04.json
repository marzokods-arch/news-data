The 6 God is in the midst of a few days off before taking the stage in Paris on Sunday (Sept. 7). After dropping off &#8220;What Did I Miss&#8221; and &#8220;Which One&#8221; featuring Central Cee as the lead singles into the Iceman era, there&#8217;s plenty of speculation that a third song is set to be premiered during the episode. At the end of the second Iceman episode, Drake teased a hard-hitting track that sent fans into a frenzy, and they&#8217;re holding out hope the untitled song will be debuted in full during episode three. &#8220;You gotta light the tower up for this,&#8221; Drake raps to open the unreleased tune while the stream shows him moving through the airport solo.

For decades, federal records show, companies linked to Manilow have applied to register Copacabana-related trademarks, including “Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana” in 1991, “Barry Manilow’s Copacabana” in 2006, “Barry Manilow’s Copacabana Hotel &amp; Casino” in 2023, and another earlier this year.

Google’s Connected Cameras feature is handy for turning another Pixel phone or GoPro into a remote camera for livestreams. It was initially billed as a Pixel 9-exclusive feature, but we’ve spotted signs of it starting to appear on older models as well. A Pixel 8 Pro owner on Reddit says they’re now seeing the Connected Cameras toggle in their settings, and they’re not alone. In Telegram groups, others report the same on the Pixel 6a and Pixel 7 beta builds. That’s at odds with Google’s support page , which still lists the Pixel 9 lineup as the only devices that can host the feature.",

    "body": "XGIMI has unveiled the Horizon 20 Series with Google TV at IFA 2025. The new projector lineup includes the Horizon 20, 20 Pro, and flagship 20 Max with 5,700 ISO lumens. Pre-orders open on September 5 in the US and UK, with shipping beginning in October. XGIMI is turning up the brightness in home entertainment. This afternoon at IFA 2025, the company introduced the Horizon 20 Series, its most luminous projectors yet, featuring Google TV. With this launch, XGIMI sets its sights squarely on home theater heavyweights like Epson and BenQ. The Horizon 20 Series comes in three variants, the Horizon 20, 20 Pro, and flagship 20 Max, but it’s the Max that steals the spotlight. With 5,700 ISO lumens, it’s bright enough to hold its own against daylight or a well-lit living room. That puts it ahead of most portable Google TV projectors and even in the same conversation as mid-range home units from brands like Epson.",

It provides pretty much all the information you need from such an app, like the temperature, the daily highs and lows, precipitation chance, and so on.

Having portable X-ray capabilities aboard spacecraft would allow astronauts to immediately assess and treat potential injuries or identify equipment issues without having to disassemble the gear.&nbsp; “Technological innovations like that of the mini-X-ray will help keep our astronauts healthy as we endeavor farther into space than …",

Today, the prepaid market offers everything from ultra-budget choices to services that deliver an experience nearly indistinguishable from premium postpaid service. But this evolution comes with a new concern: over-saturation. There are now well over a dozen reputable prepaid carriers, along with a seemingly endless wave of smaller providers. In 2025 alone, at least five new mobile services have either been announced or even launched already, including Klarna Mobile , SmartLess Mobile, Trump Mobile , Gerald BNPL Mobile, and an upcoming service from MrBeast . All of these are either tied to celebrity endorsements or backed by brands that have traditionally had no connection to wireless.",

It’s only been a couple of days since AYN confirmed the Odin 3 will be the first Android handheld powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. That alone will make it one of the most powerful handhelds on the market. The company has now followed up by posting the full spec sheet and launching the Indiegogo campaign page. The Odin 3 specs, which were shared on Discord and via @Ayn_Loki on X , partly confirm what we already knew — the device will ship with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, a 6-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen, and an 8,000mAh battery. However, it also fleshes out the different configurations. You’ll be able to pick from models with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage at the entry level, right up to an Ultra version with a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. That last option wasn’t even in the original plan but was added after fans in the AYN Discord pushed for it.",

The device tracks heart rate, activity, sleep, and recovery and syncs data to the Polar Flow app. It is available now for $199 in the US and €179 outside of the US, with shipping beginning September 10. Wearables usually fight for attention with brighter screens and smarter features, but the new Polar Loop takes the opposite approach.

At $179.90, it enters the same discreet tracking category dominated by Whoop, with a screen-free, noninvasive wearable for subtle fitness tracking . The Polar Loop doesn’t reinvent the wheel. It covers the core metrics most users care about, including daily steps and general activity, as well as heart rate , sleep quality , and recovery through Polar’s Precision Prime sensor tech. For workouts, users can either start a session manually in the Polar Flow app or rely on the device’s automatic workout detection.

    "summary": "You don’t need to manually turn on the Extra Dim feature on the Pixel 10, as it’s integrated into the brightness slider",
    "body": "The new Pixel 10 series integrates the “Extra Dim” feature directly into the main brightness slider, making it easier to access. This removes the need for a separate toggle, as Extra Dim now automatically activates when the brightness slider is at its minimum. While the feature was tested on older Pixels, it is currently exclusive to the Pixel 10, though it may come to other devices later. Google’s new Pixel 10 series introduces some surprise display upgrades, focusing more on viewing comfort than on major hardware changes. While the display panels themselves are largely unchanged, they should be easier on the eyes thanks to new features like Adaptive Tone and an enhanced PWM dimming rate . Another notable change is to Extra Dim, a feature that makes the screen even dimmer than its lowest hardware brightness setting. On the Pixel 10, Google has integrated Extra Dim directly into the brightness slider, making it much easier to control than on previous Pixel phones. Extra Dim is an accessibility feature Google introduced in Android 12 back in 2021. It dims the display “beyond your phone’s minimum brightness” by altering the red, green, and blue pixel data before it’s rendered. This …",

    "summary": "The Pixel 10 Pro's camera can be even better than Google advertised.",
    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL can shoot in 12-bit 4K video with dedicated third-party apps. The high bit depth is possible thanks to Samsung’s Smart-ISO Pro technology within the image sensor. The Pixel 10 and Pixel Camera app are still capped at 10-bit video capture. The new Google Pixel 10 series already sports some impressive new photo and video capabilities, but it appears that the Pro models are capable of even more than Google advertises. Reddit user RagSaucy has spotted that the Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL support 12-bit 4K RAW video capture — a first for the series. In theory, a higher bit-depth allows the phone to capture a wider dynamic range, resulting in additional shadow or highlight detail with less risk of over- or underexposure. Previous Pixel flagships are capped at 10-bit video capture, and that’s still the case if you shoot via the Pixel Camera app on the 10 series. To “unlock” the Pixel 10 Pro’s 12-bit option, you have to install a third-party camera app with advanced video shooting modes, such as MotionCamPro.",

This technology is Google’s version of Apple’s True Tone and was previously available on the Pixel 4 under the name “Ambient EQ.” After a five-generation absence, the feature returns to the Pixel phone lineup to improve visual comfort and viewing consistency. The Pixel 10 series isn’t a major hardware leap, though the addition of integrated Qi2 magnets is a significant improvement. While the display hardware has only seen a modest upgrade on the surface, Google has equipped the Pixel 10 with new software features to improve the viewing experience. One such feature is Adaptive Tone , designed to enhance visual comfort in any lighting condition. The Pixel 10’s new Adaptive Tone feature, found under Settings &gt; Display &amp; touch , “ dynamically adapts the display to warmer or cooler tones based on ambient lighting .” It uses the phone’s integrated ambient light and color sensor to measure the surrounding color temperature, then adjusts the display’s white balance to match.
