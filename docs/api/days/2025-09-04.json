One of these quirks is the map system, or rather, the seeming lack of it. It's definitely not uncommon for exploration-focused platformers to have obscure or downright useless maps, but for a while Silksong seems like it might not even have one at all. Don't worry though: not only does Silksong have a map, but it can be very useful so long as you cough up some rosaries ASAP. After about an hour in Silksong you'll encounter the NPC Shakra in The Marrow—listen out for the lovely yodelling. After some dialogue they'll offer to sell you a bunch of map-centric stuff, and your first instinct might be to ignore it. Of course this metroidvania will just plot out my map as I explore it, right? Nope: not only do you have to buy maps, but you have to buy map markers and other useful icons, such as those demarking resting places. Oh, and you also have to buy the ability to see yourself on the map. Even though Shakra's gear might seem expensive in total, you should 100% buy it all up as soon as you meet them. It's going to make early exploration a lot more …",

    "body": "In an interview with PC Gamer earlier this year, Eric Barone, beloved creator of Stardew Valley, mused that he might need to go hole up in a cabin in the woods to be able to fully focus on making his next game, Haunted Chocolatier . Considering he's recently announced that Stardew Valley will be getting a 1.7 update and apparently done a little moonlighting as a bug, I think he might've been onto something. I checked Silksong's credits today to see how many folks contributed to the long-awaited metroidvania outside Team Cherry's core trio, and there's Barone, right alongside several members of designer William Pellen's family. Considering Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight released within a year of each other and both went on to become some of the most successful indie games of all time, I'm not too surprised to see they travel in the same circles. Or at least they're friendly enough that when Team Cherry was in need of \"additional character voices\" for Silksong's new cast of characters, Barone got the call. Or perhaps Barone is such a massive Hollow Knight fan that he begged to go bug mode for the sequel? (Image credit: Team Cherry) If you harbor any doubt that it's the Barone, The…",

    "body": "More quizzes! (Image credit: Larian Studios, PC Gamer) Want to keep testing your knowledge of gaming trivia? We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. It's been a while since I abandoned my last Baldur's Gate 3 character somewhere in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, so naturally I'm going to have to start yet another new character for my next playthrough. The fourth one, I think, or maybe it's the fifth? I still haven't completed a full playthrough of Baldur's Gate, but I sure do have Act 1 down. It's more or less a checklist to me at this point, and I'm far from the only one who's displaced a few childhood memories to build a mental map of the Emerald Grove, Goblin Camp, Underdark, and the rest of BG3's opening chapter. How much of BG3's first act has been burned into your long-term memory? Try the 15 question quiz below to see how hopeless your RPG restarting habit is. Too easy? Too hard? Let us know in the comments how you scored. (If you get them all, you have to promise to see your current character through to the end. Enough is enough!)",

The Apple dance, as it became known, was a huge TikTok trend in summer 2024 and has been adopted by Charli XCX herself: Heyer even performed the dance live at one of the star's concerts. It was impossible to avoid at the time, and was subsequently incorporated into a Charli XCX-themed \"Brat\" update for the Roblox game Dress to Impress. The legalities all get a little murky here. Heyer and Roblox were apparently in talks to license the dance in early August last year, but then the update containing the emote was released before any \"signed agreement\", and Heyer subsequently copyrighted the dance. Her lawsuit claimed that Roblox had made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November 2024, and said Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" Well, now she has been, although there's no disclosure of the su…",

    "body": "قال أسطورة التنس السويدي بيورن بورج، في سيرته الذاتية المرتقب صدوره، إنه مصاب بالسرطان، وفقا لمقتطف نُشرت، اليوم الخميس. وجاء في الطرح الأخير \"حتى التحدي الأخير، الأهم، الذي لم ينتهِ بعد، ضد السرطان\"، رغم أن مقدمة النسخة الإنجليزية من الكتاب لا تحتوي على أي إشارة إلى المرض. وأفادت صحيفة \"إكسبريسن\" السويدية أن بورج مصاب بسرطان البروستات. وهيمن بورج الذي بلغ عامه الـ69 في حزيران/يونيو الماضي، على بطولتي ويمبلدون ورولان جاروس في سبعينيات وأوائل ثمانينيات القرن الماضي. وتُوّج بورج ببطولة رولان جاروس ست مرات بين عامي 1974 و1981، وويمبلدون خمس مرات متتالية بين 1976 و1980. كما بلغ نهائي فلاشينج ميدوز أربع مرات لكنه خسر في جميعها. قاد أيضا منتخب بلاده للظفر بكأس ديفيس للمرة الأولى في عام 1975. وبعد أن شارك بشكل ضعيف في عام 1982، اعتزل بورج بشكل مفاجئ في بداية عام 1983 وهو ما يزال في سن الـ26، ولكن في 1991، عاد بورج لفترة قصيرة إلى الملاعب مستخدما مضربا خشبيا قديما. ولم تردّ دار النشر السويدية \"نورستدتس\" التي تتولى نشر الكتاب، على طلبات التعليق المقدمة من وكالة فرانس برس. ومن المقرر أن يُنشر الكتاب الذي يحمل عنوان \"نبضات قلب\" باللغة الإنجليزية في 18 أيلول/سبتمبر.",

At time of writing, more than 500,000 people are playing Silksong on Steam, and the number's increasing every time I refresh the SteamDB chart . In its first 24 hours, Silksong's all-time peak player count is already the 18th highest in Steam history . And it'll likely rank higher before the day's out. As a point of comparison, the original Hollow Knight's Day 1 concurrent player count on Steam peaked at 812 players. In other words, there are roughly 615 times as many people playing Silksong in its first hours than there were playing Hollow Knight at launch. Call me crazy, but I think this one might be a big deal.

Premiering about half an hour before it dropped, as though to keep eager fans company through the last agonising minutes of their wait, Daily Silksong news number 1,693 said goodbye to the cast and crew that have mostly been saying 'no' for the past four plus years, but sometimes yes. After a charming stop-motion vignette in which Ara's friends have to find his bones to turn him back from stone, the host reveals his face for the first time—dressed in a suit to deliver the final bit of news, that Silksong is, in fact, releasing today. \"We finally, finally made it,\" he says, adding that he's been doing this for, in a massive understatement, \"quite a long time. \"Enough time for many things in one's life to change—and a lot of things have changed in my life during that time. I remember watching the original Silksong trailer, right as it dropped, at work on my phone. \"Some three years later,…",

With 36,000,000 users online, Steamstat.us currently lists the Steam store as operating at a \"Very slow\" capacity, occasionally ticking over to a concerned, yellow \"Bad gateway\" message. It is worth mentioning, of course, that Hollow Knight: Silksong was never up for pre-order. Anyone who wanted day-one access to the game had to turn up at 15:00 GMT on the dot and buy the dang thing. Would allowing pre-orders, rather than forcing the game's incredibly thirsty fans and legions of curious onlookers to all show up at once, have ameliorated this situation? Probably a bit. But it would have been much less funny.

The handheld is demo-ed in a recent video (via NITTRX ), with the creator commenting that playing racing games is \"very exciting.\" And while we're on the subject of peering over from the backseat, the creator has also shared pictures that demonstrate how the handheld is both longer than their rearview mirror and their forearm . This same creator has made a number of charming 'WinMini' handhelds in the past, so it's no surprise that this latest ultrawide effort is similarly Windows-based. The project is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU , the same chip in the MSI Claw A8 and the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds.

If you don't, they'll snowball into an incredible problem. When it comes to the Drifter, this issue's a little more apparent. Bloodscent gives you a literal blood trail and heartbeat sound effect while you're near isolated enemies and, more importantly, a permanent stacking weapon damage buff whenever you kill (or assist in a kill) an enemy hero. In other words, if you've got terrible map sense and are blindly farming the jungle while the Drifter's about, he's going to get a bazillion Bloodscent stacks and run you over. Victor's a little more complicated.

Of course, applying for a trade mark doesn't guarantee that trade mark gets used. It could even be an intentional distraction designed to draw attention away from some other naming scheme or project.

Most Borderlands fans would say that the game only really gets going once you've finished the campaign and reached the endgame, and I'd agree; that's when you officially start grinding post-campaign activities and gearing up your Vault Hunter. That's not changed in Borderlands 4 . In fact, it's getting a handful of really great changes that'll make it hard to go back to previous games. I'm glad that we're finally able to skip the campaign and jump straight to level 30 on alternate characters, making playing all four characters a much more enjoyable experience. Likewise, I love that gear score doesn't increase with each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode tier, so you don't need to re-farm gear each time you climb up the ranks anymore.

I'm thankful for my plush neck pillow and face mask to keep my senses dulled to what's around me when I fly, though nothing has made as great a difference as my noise cancelling headphones. The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal are my blocker of choice, as they're the most effective at reducing outside noise and jet turbine rumble to the bare minimum. So, you might be surprised to hear my rally against noise cancelling headphones for gaming, but let me explain. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is when the headset uses microphones and onboard processing to counteract outside interference. It's quite literally cancelling the noise out with an equal and opposite soundwave. There are multiple types of ANC: feed-forward, which uses a microphone outside the device to pickup external noise; and feed-back, which listens closely to what's happening closer to the listener's ear canal to more accurately counteract what's actually seeping in. The best systems often use a combination of both and adapt how they use each technology for better results. That's what the Beoplay Portal offers, so it's a great example of wha…",

The mid-season update, Season 4.5, should launch on or around Friday, October 10, 2025, just one month after the first half of the update.

At the start of the video, Bond infiltrates a hotel in much the way Agent 47 from IO Interactive's Hitman games might, spying opportunities for non-violent distraction and deception everywhere he looks: negotiate with a guard, climb a wall, light a pile of leaves on fire, turn on a hose, jump into a flower bed (not the most Bond-like behavior, but it worked). Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: Made yet another Baldur's Gate 3 character despite not having finished the game with any of the six characters he's already made. Once inside, Bond strolls around talking to himself and triggering little in-engine cutscenes, and you get the impression that there's only one way the mission can really go. When the video segues to a car chase, it makes this explicit with the text \"Inevitably…\" on the screen. In the chase, too, it seems clear that Bond is always going to be several car lengths behind his target, regardless of how many shortcuts he takes: He and the femme fatale must arrive at their ta…",

There's a cozy game, a couple puzzlers, and one with lots of combat, if that's what you're looking for.

I pick up loot and have no idea if it's good or not, the gigantic skill tree gives me chills, and I couldn't tell you anything about the lore. I'm willing to endure the most prickly parts of PoE 2 because the campaign is excellent—and it just got better. The latest update adds a new act that has me fully on board with Grinding Gear Games' vision for an action RPG campaign that might be as ambitious as the version of Diablo 2 that exists in people's memories. I'm too young to have had my mind blown by Blizzard 25 years ago, but right now, in 2025, I'm not sure anyone is doing it like GGG. I'm so impressed by the new act that I'll forgive the pacing issues in the rest of the campaign. After all, that's what releasing your game in early access is for, right? Part of me sympathizes with PoE 1 players who hate spending 30 hours getting torn apart by regular old skeletons when all they want to do is charge straight to the endgame. The endless mazes in act 3 test my patience every time I replay it, but now that I've seen what lies beyond that, I trust GGG to find a good balance of soulslike pacing and action RPG …",

With review embargoes lifting today, critics have been sharing their thoughts—and so far, our own Cronos review is among the more critical. While we eventually enjoyed the ideas explored in its time-twisting story, we found the amount of mandated zombie killing—sorry, \"orphan\" killing—slowed things to a slog. Other takes, however, share a much rosier view of Nowa Huta and its post-apocalyptic charms.

The deep sea diver aesthetic of the FPS roguelike has a slight \"we have BioShock at home\" feel to it for a few minutes, but that dissipates once you're firing a WW1-era repeater or a crackling Tesla gun at towering Aztec-influenced ancient gods who in return assault you with waves and laser beams. Abyssus is a lithe shooter: you've got a dash and a double-jump right from the start, and enemies like divebombing exploding sharks encourage constant dancing around its battle arenas.
