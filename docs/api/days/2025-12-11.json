    "body": "TL;DR Disney has formally demanded Google stop allowing Disney characters to appear in AI images and videos. This comes as Disney and OpenAI have announced a licensing deal that sees Disney acquire a $1 billion stake in OpenAI. Google has not responded to request for comment. Earlier today, OpenAI announced a major deal with Disney that will allow ChatGPT and Sora to create officially licensed, AI-generated imagery featuring the media giant’s popular characters. Now, Disney wants to stop another leading AI provider from doing the same. Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, accusing the company of copyright infringement in Gemini output. Variety reports that in a letter reviewed by the publication, Disney’s lawyers accuse Google of infringing on Disney’s copyrights “on a massive scale,” citing Gemini’s ability to create imagery that includes copyrighted characters from across Disney’s expansive catalog of intellectual properties. Disney has apparently been informally communicating with Google about this for some time, but as of today, Gemini still readily produces imagery featuring Disney’s characters.",

The spokesperson states that an optimization was identified and that the rollout across all devices is “progressing as planned.” Nothing OS 4.0 began rolling out to the Phone 3 on November 21 and days later to the Phone 2, Phone 2a, Phone 2a Plus, Phone 3a, and Phone 3a Pro.

But instead of throwing a fit, the Sun spews magnetized material and hazardous high-energy particles that drive space weather as they travel across the solar system. These outbursts can impact our daily lives, from disrupting technologies like GPS to triggering power outages, and they can also imperil voyaging astronauts and spacecraft. Understanding how these solar outbursts, called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), occur and where they are headed is essential to predicting and preparing for their impacts at Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Images taken by Parker Solar Probe in December 2024, and published Thursday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters , have revealed that not all magnetic material in a CME escapes the Sun — some makes it back, changing the shape of the solar atmosphere in subt…",

    "summary": "Like other foldables, the Galaxy Z TriFold lets you transition apps from the cover to the main screen, but there’s a catch.",
    "body": "TL;DR Enabling App Continuity on the Galaxy Z TriFold causes the device to lower the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen. Samsung lowers the cover screen’s rendering resolution to match the inner screen’s pixel density so apps don’t restart when unfolding. A hardware upscaler keeps the display looking sharp, but screenshots capture the raw, lower-resolution image before it is processed. Like most foldable phones , the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold sports two displays: an outer cover screen and an inner main screen. What makes the TriFold unique is that its inner screen folds twice, giving the device its signature look. In most other respects, though, the TriFold behaves like any other Samsung foldable. It supports App Continuity, for example, allowing you to seamlessly transition apps from the cover to the main screen. However, this feature causes an interesting quirk on the TriFold: it compromises the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen — but for good reason.

Only titles where the publisher opts out of DRM will qualify, so most Kindle books still won’t be downloadable. Amazon is bringing back something Kindle fans didn’t expect to see again: direct downloads. Starting January 20, 2026, anyone who buys a qualifying DRM-free title will be able to download an EPUB or PDF version from their Amazon account. The change was quietly announced in Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing documentation , and it marks the first time in years that the company has offered a sanctioned path to download Kindle content outside its walled garden. It’s also a sharp contrast to Amazon’s decision in early 2025 to remove the long-standing Download &amp; Transfer via USB option, a shift that did not go over well with the brand’s power users.",

It remains unclear whether the Gemini experience will run within the app or redirect users externally to the Gemini app. Gemini started off slow, but Google has made great progress in making the AI digital assistant actually useful. The reception from consumers is just as great, and it makes sense that Google would want all of its products to benefit from it . We’ve now spotted hints that Gemini could soon be coming to the Google Play Books &amp; Audiobooks app. Given how useful adding Gemini to a Kindle can be, adding Gemini to the Play Books app could change how people read books within Google’s ecosystem.

Samsung appears so confident of its effects that it also wants to sell it to clients such as Qualcomm. If that works out, we might see it being used on the rumored special version of Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Samsung’s Exynos chipsets have been relentlessly criticized and trolled for their heating issues. The poor heat management on Exynos chips has also contributed to throttling and their inability to sustain high performance for long enough, which has traditionally made them less desirable than Snapdragon-branded counterparts. But Samsung has refused to abandon that ship, and might have actually addressed it with the upcoming Exynos 2600, which could power some of the Galaxy S26 models in certain regions. Not just Samsung appears so confident in its solution that it’s ready to offer it to other companies, including Apple and Qualcomm. According to a recent report by the Korean outlet ET News , Samsung has formally announced its technology to address heat-related throttling issues on chipsets.

However, it’s currently slightly challenging to work with, especially if you use swipe gestures for navigation, and we hope Samsung fixes it. After months of leaks, Samsung’s next big update, One UI 8.5, is finally ready for beta testing. And it brings a highly modified interface that could spark opinions about drawing inspiration from Apple’s iOS 26 . But in addition to the renewed system UI and apps, One UI 8.5 is also bringing improvements to key functionalities, and one of them is how screen recording works. With Samsung’s first official One UI 8.5 beta build released, we’re now seeing a new menu for screen recording features. One of the chief changes is the ability to record only a part of the screen instead of the entire screen, which is easier than cropping the video later.",

When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house.

These limited edition glasses borrow their hardware from VITURE’s recently launched Lumo Pro glasses. VITURE has also announced a new dock that extends compatibility to Nintendo Switch 2. Earlier this week, Google showed us a glimpse of what Android XR could look like without bulky glasses covering up a part of your face. These will be light-use glasses that complement, rather than replace, standalone headsets such as the Galaxy XR. In the meantime, tethered glasses that serve as extended displays for devices such as handheld gaming devices, laptops, or iPads are increasingly popular. VITURE is already flourishing in this segment, with more than 50% of the market share in the US. And today, it is bringing a (sort of) new product, marking its fondness for gamers. VITURE has announced a special edition of its Luma XR glasses to mark the fifth anniversary of Cyberpunk 2077’s release. These new edition glasses, created as part of an official collaboration with CD PROJEKT RED, appear to be based on the Luma Pro, which was only announced in July this year along…",

    "body": "TL;DR Google may be working on a native App Lock feature for Android 17 that lets users secure specific apps without the restrictions of Private Space. This new API allows the default launcher to lock apps, eliminating the need to use third-party app lockers. We spotted code for this feature in a recent Android Canary build, though it isn’t expected to officially launch until next year’s major update. People store a lot of sensitive data on their Android phones , so it’s no wonder they are reluctant to hand them over to anyone they don’t trust. Even if you are comfortable letting a friend or family member borrow your device, you probably still have data you don’t want them to see. Locking down specific apps is a great way to protect your privacy, but the core Android OS still lacks a native way to do this, forcing many users — especially of Pixel devices — to rely on third-party tools. Fortunately, Google may finally address this in next year’s Android 17 update by adding a new App Lock feature.

YouTube has recently begun testing the ability to allow users to customize their feed , giving them control over what they are recommended to watch next.

A recent Reddit thread asking how the thermometer “contributes to your life” spiralled into an interesting catalogue of real-world uses, from checking toddler fevers to proving a hotel room’s AC was broken. That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home .

This bug is the reason why the LibrePods app requires a rooted Android device. LibrePods brings features like ANC controls, ear detection, and more to AirPods on Android. An enterprising developer recently released an app called LibrePods , which enables a more feature-rich AirPods experience on Android. The app currently requires root access, and it turns out that a long-standing Android Bluetooth bug is the reason for this requirement. LibrePods developer Kavish Devar posted a bug report on Google’s Issue Tracker back on October 6, 2024 (h/t: Hacker News ), noting the specific code that’s standing in the way of root-free AirPods support. Over 9,100 votes have been cast on the issue, but the bug’s status has been marked as “assigned” by Google ever since then.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new menu found in the latest Android Canary build reveals the UI for a game controller remapping feature likely coming in Android 17. Found under Bluetooth settings, the “Game Controller settings” page allows users to customize inputs for both buttons (“Keys”) and directional sticks (“Axes”). The feature likely works by changing which internal key codes and axis values are transmitted to games. Last month, I shared evidence that Google is working on new gaming features for Android 17 . These include support for remapping buttons on gaming controllers and potentially a virtual gamepad. At the time, I wasn’t able to show off any of these features as the menus were incomplete. Thanks to a recent Canary release, however, I’m now able to demo what the UI for Android’s game controller remapping feature looks like.

We don’t know when this feature will make it to stable Chrome. AI Mode is Google’s attempt to combine its longstanding flagship product Search with a more chatbot-like experience, answering questions using info from the web by parsing and reiterating information from web pages in an interaction that feels like a plain-language conversation. Now, the company’s working on integrating that experience more directly into the Chrome browser, testing a new version of AI Mode inside Chrome Canary. As spotted by Windows Report , the latest Chrome Canary desktop build features a version of Google’s AI Mode that opens in Chrome itself at chrome://contextual-tasks rather than directing the user to an external Google Search tab on the web. The interface is quite similar to the web implementation, showing the same Meet AI Mode heading and “Ask anything” text box.",
