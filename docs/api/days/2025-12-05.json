But with the new Dream Team feature coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley as part of the Winter Ball update on Wednesday, December 10, this problem might be removed entirely. In a reel posted to the Disney Dreamlight Valley YouTube channel , more details have been shown about what exactly this feature does. With this addition, you'll be able to join forces with a group of seven friends, give yourself a name, motto, and a logo, and then start requesting materials. This can be anything from crafting materials like clay and iron, to quest items like fish, flowers, and crops. If you'd rather fulfil a request from your friend instead, it's just as easy as placing one. When you're in the Dream Teams menu, you'll see every item that each of your friends has asked for. Click on the one you have, and you'll be asked if you want to trade. By agreeing, your items will immediately be shipped off to your p…",

However, the new update coming on Tuesday, December 9, not only adds a haunting new enemy, but an entirely new setting which already gives me the heebie-jeebies. In a trailer uploaded to the Red Barrels YouTube channel , Project Messiah has been revealed. This update plans to take us away from the sterile halls of the Murkoff facility and into what looks like a desolate lodge. Except, unlike a lot of churches I've been into, this one is filled with masked mannequins, statues, and of course—dead bodies. This is The Outlast Trials after all. But among all of the masked mannequins is Liliya Bogomolova, also referred to as Sister Liliya, who is adorned in an almost identical outfit to some of the mannequins.

It even took them a while to come up with a name, but they eventually settled on Nvidia. Yes, that little, independent, underdog company. The one worth $5 trillion back in October. That level of fortune gives one plenty of opportunities to spend hours reminiscing about the past, present, and future, which is precisely what Jensen Huang and Joe Rogan recently did. Specifically, for almost two and a half hours, Huang chatted on the Joe Rogan Experience about all things AI, GPU, CUDA, consciousness, and what have you. There's an awful lot to delve into, but I was particularly drawn to the section where Rogan remarks on Nvidia's massive AI growth and capabilities: \"How funny would it be that it [AI] is birthed out of the desire for computer graphics for video games? It's kind of crazy when you think about it that way.\" This prompted Jensen to start going over Nvidia's beginning, when it was a tiny group of engineers in 1993: \"We were trying to create this new computing approach.

That's very counter-intuitive: Steam is far and away the dominant PC storefront, and conventional wisdom states that if you're not there, you're missing out on a major chunk of potential revenue. Witness, for instance, the reaction to the recent ban of Horses on Steam : Yeah, it was also dropped by the Epic Games Store and, for a day, Humble, but Steam is the one that really hurt, and developer Santa Ragione said losing it might force the studio to close. But Hypixel Studios has a very good reason for taking a pass on it: Steam user reviews. \"We want to spend our time in Early Access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing,\" Hytale executive director Patrick \"Lyall\" Derbic wrote in a new FAQ . \"Steam is a great marketing tool but one that we might never need.

Neither Eidos nor parent company Embracer Group (yes, it's an Embracer studio) have confirmed the layoffs or responded to requests for comment. This would be the second round of layoffs at Eidos Montreal in 2025, following a cut of roughly 75 employees in March .

The 25 Most Wanted PC games for 2026 #25: Reanimal (Image credit: Tarsier Studios) Developer: Tarsier Studios | Release Date : TBD From the makers of Little Nightmares 1 and 2 comes another co-op horror game, and this one's even more unnerving than its predecessors. In Reanimal, a young brother and sister return to the island they were raised on, only now it's infested by horrifying chimera hellbent on chasing them through every decrepit corner of what once was home. #24: Grave Seasons Developer: Perfect Garbage | Release Date : 2026 Grave Seasons is a farming sim with a supernatural twist.

Who needs to get up close and personal when you can just set light to your foes from afar? This is a game not only about smacking goblins around with firebolts, but also rebuilding a home for your people and keeping it safe. The trailer hints at the expansive structures you'll have a chance to construct, with a wide shot of a grand Dwarven staircase leading to gods-know-where.
