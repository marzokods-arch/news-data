Ozuna, Beéle, Stendhal (Nibiru International/Sony Music Latin) Two weeks ago, Ozuna and Beéle presented their first collaborative effort, “Enemigos”— but never did fans expect 13 other songs together would follow. The Afro-house track about a forbidden desire, which samples Aventura’s “Los Infieles,” marked the first taste of the Puerto Rican and Colombian artists&#8217; joint album Stendhal . The 14-track production, produced by Colombian hitmaker Ovy on the Drums and others, is rooted in the Afrolatino fusion with other global genres such as reggaetón, kizomba, electronic, and dembow. Tracks such as “Pikito,” “El Volcán,” “Cookie,” and “Explícito” evoke sensual and provocative emotions. In others, they pay homage to timeless Latin tunes: “Ale” is inspired by Fernando Villalona’s “Carnaval (Baile en la Calle)”;&nbsp; “Te Culié” by Las Ketchup’s “Asereje”; and “Antes de Irme” by Xuxa’s “Ilaríe.” The album’s name, Stendhal , is inspired by Stendhal Syndrome, where the art of great beauty prof…",

Even better, he teased a new, ambitious membership program. Reportedly, the all-in-one membership program will include a flagship phone, multi-network uncapped premium data, a global number with international data, device protection, enhanced support perks, and more. US Mobile opened a waiting list for the program and noted that availability may be limited, with final details and pricing still unknown. US Mobile is known for great service, great pricing, and support for all three major US networks. If we’re being honest, it’s also known semi-regular stream of posts from the CEO that hint about what’s coming down the pipeline.

It features a 4.3-inch E Ink display rated at 220ppi, which is softer than the 300ppi panels found on most mainstream e-readers, but the X4 is meant for quick reading breaks rather than extended binge sessions.",

    "body": "Credit: Andrew Grush / Android Authority TL;DR Starlink filed new trademarks, including “Starlink Mobile” and “Powered by Starlink”, covering cellular communication services and delivery of video and data to mobile devices. The filings follow Starlink’s growing telecom activity, including its T-Mobile satellite partnership and recent acquisition of terrestrial spectrum from EchoStar. None of this is too surprising, as Musk had previously stated that Starlink may eventually offer full cellular service, though he suggested it was likely a ways off at the time. Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well. This collaboration eventually led to T-Satellite by Starlink , which offers limited connectivity in areas where cellular towers are unavailable. As first spotted by PC Mag , it now appears that a new trademark suggests Starlink’s mobile ambitions likely extend far beyond this. Don’t …",

    "body": "Credit: Rushil Agrawal / Android Authority TL;DR TicWatch models have largely vanished from Amazon and Mobvoi’s website. Mobvoi said it has “no new information to announce” but will keep existing watches on “essential support.” This could suggest that the brand that once helped prop up Wear OS is being phased out. Smartwatch fans may have spotted a notable omission from this year’s holiday sales. The Mobvoi TicWatch lineup has been a steady presence in the Wear OS world for years, but most of its watches seem to have slipped away from retailers without much fanfare. You can’t currently buy them on either Amazon or Mobvoi’s own website, which seems to be an ominous sign that the lineup is fading out. As reported by 9to5Google , all TicWatch listings on Amazon have essentially disappeared . On Mobvoi’s site, the watches have been removed from the product listings, and even the odd ones that can be navigated to via banners lead to a notice stating that the product is unavailable when you click the buy button.",

You can trigger it on a monitor by long-clicking the home or app drawer buttons. Circle to Search is one of Android’s most useful features, letting you quickly Google any text or image onscreen. It can translate text, identify songs, act as a game guide, and even warn you about potential scams. While Google has brought the feature to most premium Android phones since its debut, it has remained limited to their main, internal displays. Connect your phone to an external monitor, and you’ll find the feature unaware of its existence — fortunately, Google has addressed this limitation in the latest Android update.

Users report consistent success triggering actions with double-back tap, as compared to the hit-and-miss before. You can enable the feature or change its function under Settings &gt; System &gt; Gestures &gt; Quick Tap to start actions. December 2025 has been an exciting month for Pixel fans. Google not only rolled out the much-loved Android 16 QPR2 release in the stable branch, but it also quashed a ton of bugs with the update. Beyond what Google announced, users also reported that the update quietly restored the screen-off fingerprint unlock feature. Google didn’t announce this either, but as it turns out, the company may have also improved the double-tap back panel gesture. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

At the time, OnePlus stated that it was “refining the thermal curve” and has since issued an update to the handset, claiming it has addressed the problem. So we’ve updated our handset and re-run the tests to find out. Before conducting the stress tests, we re-ran the OnePlus 15 through GeekBench 6 to verify that the phone’s overall performance profile hadn’t changed. The good news is that CPU performance remains just as good, if not marginally better (though a 1.5% to 2% improvement is within the margin of error) than before the update. Flicking on the phone’s performance mode is actually closer to 5% faster in multi-core.",

One interesting new addition to this trend is YouTube.

It’s surprisingly helpful, and users seemingly think so too. We conducted a reader poll to gauge user sentiment on the new feature.

Early testing showed incompatibility issues between the two devices, but users confirm the connection now works seamlessly. This allows Pixel owners to join video calls on the console without needing to purchase or carry a separate webcam. One of the new social gaming features introduced with the Nintendo Switch 2 is GameChat, which essentially lets you join a group video call where everyone shares their game screen and camera feed. GameChat lets you see and chat with friends even if they’re playing different games, but it requires external hardware to show your face, as the Switch 2 lacks a built-in camera. Nintendo says the Switch 2 works with most USB webcams, but in our early testing, we found that it wasn’t compatible with the Pixel’s USB webcam mode. Fortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

I pinged a few members of the SoundGuys crew and checked in with our own Rita El Khoury, whose gadget tastes often match my own.

Recent leaks point to redesigned Clock, Calculator, and Internet apps. The update brings a good dose of colors and 3D neomorphic effects. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

Founder Nicholas Merrill says the goal is to break the link between a person’s phone identity and their personal data.

Nicholas Merrill is best known for fighting an FBI surveillance order for more than a decade. He has now launched Phreeli, a new mobile carrier that lets you sign up with nothing more than your ZIP code. As Wired reports, Phreeli (pronounced like ‘freely’) runs on T-Mobile’s network, but the real headline is what it refuses to collect. The company doesn’t ask for your name, address, or any other information that could be linked to your phone number. Merrill states that the level of anonymity is legal in every US state, and the ZIP code is provided solely for tax purposes.",

For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas.

Kobo shoppers may be in for a meaningful upgrade if there’s a Libra Colour in their carts. The company just quietly gave the already-popular device a larger 2,300mAh battery. The change, reported earlier this week by Good e-Reader, brings a welcome boost to endurance and should translate to nearly an extra week of reading time. It’s a small tweak on paper, but for anyone who’s eyed color e-ink with skepticism over battery drain, it could improve the day-to-day experience.

The Resolve instrument aboard XRISM , pronounced “crism,” discovered these elements in a supernova remnant called Cassiopeia A or Cas A, for short. The expanding cloud of debris is located about 11,000 light-years away in the northern constellation Cassiopeia. “This discovery helps illustrate how the deaths of stars and life on Earth are fundamentally linked,” said Toshiki Sato, an astrophysicist at Meiji University in Tokyo. “Stars appear to shimmer quietly in the night sky, but they actively forge materials that form planets and enable life as we know it. Now, thanks to XRISM, we have a better idea of when and how stars might make crucial, yet harder-to-find, elements.” A paper about the result published Dec. 4 in Nature Astronomy. Sato led the study with Kai Matsunaga and Hiroyuki Uchida, both at Kyoto University in Japan. JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) leads XRISM in collaboration with NASA, al…",

    "body": "TL;DR Researchers have identified a new banking malware that replaces your actual banking app with a malicious one. It primarily spreads through APKs distributed via unmoderated channels such as messaging platforms. Once installed, the malware enables hackers to remotely control your device and hide their activities behind fake blank or update screens. Just last week, we learned about a banking malware that exploits accessibility settings on Android to steal your bank credentials in the background. Now, we’re looking at another malware that not only enables remote attacks on Android devices but is distributed freely among hackers as part of a subscription service. Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps. One of the ways that hackers use to achieve that is by creating fake replicas of Google Play Store listings, making users believe they are downloading apps from secure sources when they are actually not. …",

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR Steam’s maker, Valve, has been playing a huge role in Windows emulation on Android. Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.

Wrist gestures used to be a thing up until Wear OS 3, and Google’s version of double-pinch is identical to what Apple and Samsung offer on their respective watches. Pixel Watch users have been asking for better gesture controls for years, and it looks like Google is finally answering their call. Ever since the Pixel Watch 4 introduced Raise to Talk for summoning Gemini , users, including yours truly, have hoped Google would expand its capabilities into more intuitive wrist and finger-based controls. After all, wrist gestures were a thing in the early Android Wear era before being quietly dropped them during the transition to Wear OS. Meanwhile, rivals like Samsung and Apple have offered gestures such as double-tap/double-pinch, fist tap, and more for years now. Well, it looks like the Pixel Watch will finally catch up to its competition real soon.",

The Android QPR2 brings support for force-theming icons, a forced dark mode for apps that don’t inherently support it, additional accessibility features for better screen visibility, and more. One more feature that may have flown under the radar is the improvements the update brings to Circle to Search, and particularly how it handles translations.

In November, T-Mobile shared plans to “unleash the un-carrier” at a live event held in Las Vegas. During that event, the company unveiled its new “ Switching Made Easy ” tool, an AI-powered guide within the T-Life app that scans your existing AT&amp;T or Verizon account to provide suggestions for similar T-Mobile plans. As its name implies, the tool aims to alleviate some of the headaches associated with switching from a carrier to T-Mobile.

Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference.

Mine just appeared, and while my stats prove how much time I invest in the app, I’m far from fluent in my chosen language, so it’s also a reminder that Duolingo can be more about engagement than learning . The company hasn’t made a big announcement this time around, but its campaigns page now reads: “Year in Review 2025 is here. What did you achieve?” and reminds you that you may need to update the app before the recap shows up.",

With the Buds 4 lineup, the base model could lower capacity further, while the Buds 4 Pro may get a larger battery. An earlier report claims only a modest increase to Samsung’s charging case battery capacity. When we’re anticipating the next generation of one of our favorite mobile devices, we get very excited when the first specs start arriving. Right away, we’re going to be comparing those against existing models, looking at what’s getting better, what’s staying the same, and what — god forbid — is getting a downgrade. Lately we’ve been uncovering some details about Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro , and to those we can now add a few battery figures.
