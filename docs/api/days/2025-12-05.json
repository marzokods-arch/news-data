You can trigger it on a monitor by long-clicking the home or app drawer buttons. Circle to Search is one of Android’s most useful features, letting you quickly Google any text or image onscreen. It can translate text, identify songs, act as a game guide, and even warn you about potential scams. While Google has brought the feature to most premium Android phones since its debut, it has remained limited to their main, internal displays. Connect your phone to an external monitor, and you’ll find the feature unaware of its existence — fortunately, Google has addressed this limitation in the latest Android update.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The December 2025 update for Pixels, which introduces Android 16 QPR2, has improved the responsiveness of the Quick Tap gesture. Users report consistent success triggering actions with double-back tap, as compared to the hit-and-miss before. You can enable the feature or change its function under Settings &gt; System &gt; Gestures &gt; Quick Tap to start actions. December 2025 has been an exciting month for Pixel fans. Google not only rolled out the much-loved Android 16 QPR2 release in the stable branch, but it also quashed a ton of bugs with the update. Beyond what Google announced, users also reported that the update quietly restored the screen-off fingerprint unlock feature. Google didn’t announce this either, but as it turns out, the company may have also improved the double-tap back panel gesture. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The proposed acquisition could see Netflix and HBO Max bundled together. If the bid is successful, it would reportedly lower the combined cost for consumers. Update: December 5, 2025 (10:43 AM ET): Netflix has announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Warner Bros Discovery to acquire WBD’s film and television studios, HBO Max, and HBO. This means that shows and movies, including the DC Universe, The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz, and more, will now be under the Netflix umbrella once the transaction is closed. In the announcement, Netflix states that it “expects to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.” The company also says, “By adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.” Netflix did not share how this development will affect its streaming prices.",

At the time, OnePlus stated that it was “refining the thermal curve” and has since issued an update to the handset, claiming it has addressed the problem. So we’ve updated our handset and re-run the tests to find out. Before conducting the stress tests, we re-ran the OnePlus 15 through GeekBench 6 to verify that the phone’s overall performance profile hadn’t changed. The good news is that CPU performance remains just as good, if not marginally better (though a 1.5% to 2% improvement is within the margin of error) than before the update. Flicking on the phone’s performance mode is actually closer to 5% faster in multi-core.",

Early testing showed incompatibility issues between the two devices, but users confirm the connection now works seamlessly.

One of the new social gaming features introduced with the Nintendo Switch 2 is GameChat, which essentially lets you join a group video call where everyone shares their game screen and camera feed. GameChat lets you see and chat with friends even if they’re playing different games, but it requires external hardware to show your face, as the Switch 2 lacks a built-in camera. Nintendo says the Switch 2 works with most USB webcams, but in our early testing, we found that it wasn’t compatible with the Pixel’s USB webcam mode. Fortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

No, it’s not that they ran out of juice or that I lost my charging cable; they just flat-out stopped working. And, as someone with several weekends of fall travel coming up, that was going to be a problem. I knew I’d have to replace my trusty ‘buds, and I’d have to do it reasonably quickly. So, I did what any well-informed shopper would do: I sought out the advice of experts. I pinged a few members of the SoundGuys crew and checked in with our own Rita El Khoury, whose gadget tastes often match my own. I gave them my budget, which wasn’t much considering I was coming from the CMF Buds Pro 2 , and asked what they thought I should get next.",

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s One UI 8.5 is expected to bring a major redesign for its system apps. Recent leaks point to redesigned Clock, Calculator, and Internet apps. The update brings a good dose of colors and 3D neomorphic effects. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

Founder Nicholas Merrill says the goal is to break the link between a person’s phone identity and their personal data. If you’ve ever felt uneasy about how much your phone company knows about you, you might soon have a more private option. Nicholas Merrill is best known for fighting an FBI surveillance order for more than a decade. He has now launched Phreeli, a new mobile carrier that lets you sign up with nothing more than your ZIP code. As Wired reports, Phreeli (pronounced like ‘freely’) runs on T-Mobile’s network, but the real headline is what it refuses to collect. The company doesn’t ask for your name, address, or any other information that could be linked to your phone number. Merrill states that the level of anonymity is legal in every US state, and the ZIP code is provided solely for tax purposes.",

This setting allows the network to use a single device’s location data to find lost items, improving reliability in low-traffic areas. The new screen simplifies the options and explicitly warns that the default setting may make it harder to locate items in remote places. For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas. While it looks unlikely that Google will reverse this decision soon, the company is starting to nudge users to enable the network’s more reliable tracking setting.

With the first quarterly release of Android 16 , Google completely revamped the operating system’s UI to introduce its new Material 3 Expressive design language. From the notification panel to the Settings app to the lock screen and beyond, Google redesigned nearly every system interface visible to the user. However, Android is a huge OS, so Google missed a few parts during the initial overhaul, such as the Package Installer that handles sideloading apps. With Android’s latest update, the Package Installer has finally received its Material 3 Expressive redesign, too. After receiving the Android 16 QPR2 update that rolled out the other day, developer Rob Wainwright discovered that Google redesigned the dialogs that appear when you install an app from outside the Play Store . The new la…",

    "body": "TL;DR Researchers have identified a new banking malware that replaces your actual banking app with a malicious one. It primarily spreads through APKs distributed via unmoderated channels such as messaging platforms. Once installed, the malware enables hackers to remotely control your device and hide their activities behind fake blank or update screens. Just last week, we learned about a banking malware that exploits accessibility settings on Android to steal your bank credentials in the background. Now, we’re looking at another malware that not only enables remote attacks on Android devices but is distributed freely among hackers as part of a subscription service. Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps. One of the ways that hackers use to achieve that is by creating fake replicas of Google Play Store listings, making users believe they are downloading apps from secure sources when they are actually not. …",

Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.

We’ve found clear code evidence suggesting Google is developing double-pinch and wrist-turn gestures for its smartwatches. Wrist gestures used to be a thing up until Wear OS 3, and Google’s version of double-pinch is identical to what Apple and Samsung offer on their respective watches. Pixel Watch users have been asking for better gesture controls for years, and it looks like Google is finally answering their call. Ever since the Pixel Watch 4 introduced Raise to Talk for summoning Gemini , users, including yours truly, have hoped Google would expand its capabilities into more intuitive wrist and finger-based controls. After all, wrist gestures were a thing in the early Android Wear era before being quietly dropped them during the transition to Wear OS. Meanwhile, rivals like Samsung and Apple have offered gestures such as double-tap/double-pinch, fist tap, and more for years now. Well, it looks like the Pixel Watch will finally catch up to its competition real soon.",

With Scroll and translate, you can continue to use your phone while it translates what’s on the screen. The feature has been limited to Samsung devices since it first launched in September, but is now rolling out to Pixel 6 and newer Pixel devices. Google started pushing the second quarterly Android 16 — QPR2 — update to the Pixel 6 and newer Pixels earlier this week. As with the first quarterly update, there is a significant emphasis on visual improvements . The Android QPR2 brings support for force-theming icons, a forced dark mode for apps that don’t inherently support it, additional accessibility features for better screen visibility, and more. One more feature that may have flown under the radar is the improvements the update brings to Circle to Search, and particularly how it handles translations. Until now, if you had to use Circle to Search for translations, it required capturing a screen and then waiting for translations. However, the new update includes a “ Scroll and translate ” option, allowing Circle to Search to translate text while you scroll…",

Dye will create a new Meta design studio focused on hardware, software, and AI integration. The move could give Meta’s wearable devices an edge as they face emerging threats from Google and Samsung via Android XR. Meta has wielded its financial might to stock up talent in the technology industry, spending millions on poaching AI engineers, researchers, and executives from competitors like Apple and OpenAI. Now, it’s using that strategy to nab Apple’s vice president of human interface design, who led the company’s software design efforts for a decade. The Apple design executive, Alan Dye, will reportedly join Meta on December 31, according to a Bloomberg report. It comes at a time when Meta’s wearable devices face significant threats, with Google and Samsung building out headsets and smart glasses under the Android XR platform to challenge the Quest, Ray-Ban Meta, and Oakley Meta lines.",

Both carriers appear to be blocking account access when their users attempt to sign in through the T-Life app. AT&amp;T has filed a lawsuit against T-Mobile for attempting to scrape information from customers’ accounts. In November, T-Mobile shared plans to “unleash the un-carrier” at a live event held in Las Vegas. During that event, the company unveiled its new “ Switching Made Easy ” tool, an AI-powered guide within the T-Life app that scans your existing AT&amp;T or Verizon account to provide suggestions for similar T-Mobile plans. As its name implies, the tool aims to alleviate some of the headaches associated with switching from a carrier to T-Mobile.

And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware.
