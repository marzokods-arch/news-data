Back in 2006, Microsoft released a seemingly innocuous device called the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000.

The great Steam enwidening came to the Steam beta client in August (you can opt into beta updates in the \"Interface\" tab of the Steam settings), and has now rolled out to everyone.

    "body": "Give power-hungry World of Warcraft: Legion Remix players a way to infinitely spawn enemies and they'll farm it until the servers die. Blizzard has yet to step in on a newly discovered method of spawning endless numbers of enemies in the latest phase of Legion Remix. Unlike the Gulp Frogs incident in Mists of Pandaria Remix, this farm seems relatively less broken, but it still can net you millions of infinite power, which is used to level up your weapon and increase your character's overall strength. It's been two days since players began capitalizing on it and Blizzard hasn't made any move to kill it. The exploit does, however, cause serious lag from the volume of enemies pouring in if you happen to be nearby, which might be enough for it to land on Blizzard's nerf radar. For now, players are grouping up to slay as many demons as they can before the valve gets shut off. The Sentinax farm, as it's being referred to, is pretty straightforward. In the Broken Shore area there's an event full of demons that drop items you can use to spawn more demons. The trick is to join a group so you can keep a constant supply of them flowing in.

It's something the folks at Square Enix and Larian know a thing or two about; but while the higher-ups at Square have made it clear they'd like the vast majority of the QA process automated , Larian publishing honcho Michael Douse says that's \"stupid.\" Square's plans, which came to light in a recent financial progress report, were part of a larger push to utilize AI in partnership with a research team at Matsuo Laboratory at the University of Tokyo. That report named a goal which, were I a QA worker at Square Enix right about now, I would find pretty startling: to \"automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027.\" Douse, publishing director at Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian, conceded Thursday in a post on X that \"AI and automation is clearly integral to QA for any large scale game\" but said \"the idea that QA people can be replaced at a large scale is stupid because it supposes that the conversations with them can be replaced and they can't.

What you've also probably noticed is that opening up the view to make things more immersive just ruins the visual experience. The good news is that one UK team reckons it's cracked the problem, and it's already made the tools for game devs. Human vision has a horizontal field of view of around 200 degrees or so, but the vast majority of 3D games stick with 75 to 90 degrees. Many will let you play around with an FOV (field of view) setting, but once you go over 100, the edges go all kinds of wonky. It is possible, of course, to code a game so that it doesn't do this, but it's easier said than done. That's because while it's a piece of cake to increase the horizontal size of the frustrum created by the camera in a 3D world, objects at the edge of the FOV will look distorted and stretched unless this is all accounted for and corrected. And what might work fine at 110 degrees, for a game that's normally 90 degrees, might not work very well at higher FOV values. Enter stage left, Fovo Techno…",

But why keep giving dates with so much confidence when they know it needs more time to polish?\" (Image credit: Rockstar) But among fans trying to rationalise another delay, there are others within the gaming industry sharing support , thinly-veiled threats , and even some theories about the breaking GTA 6 news. \"Interestingly, just a little industry knowledge for all you gamers, a Nov 19 launch puts them outside the nomination window for most game awards in 2026,\" Palworld's communications director, Bucky, says in a social media post . \"Intentional or…?

After three or four matches, the audio would drop out for a full second or two, intermittently but repeatedly, multiple times per minute. The game continued to run normally, to be clear, it was just dead silent. The effect was incredibly distracting and irritating, and for a game as dependent on audio cues as Arc Raiders, it was a deal breaker: I was ready to quit playing if I couldn't find a fix. Fortunately, I did find a fix.

Surviving Mars comfortably slots into the first group, but given the original's relative youth, you could be forgiven for assuming it's part of the latter. Haemimont Games and Paradox Interactive released the original Surviving Mars back in 2018. In my Surviving Mars review , I said it was \"a lot of hard work, but managing a burgeoning colony never stops being compelling\", and then slapped an 80% on it. Thanks to the DLC, we were then able to keep expanding our colonies with new features all the way up to 2022. (Image credit: Paradox) This is not an ageing classic, then. Nor has its relevance diminished. Survival city builders are even more popular than they were when Surviving Mars first launched, and the fantasy of colonising Mars is as zeitgeisty as ever.

But I still consider myself a fan of the Mafia series and, indeed, of Hangar 13 as a studio—it proved it can put out a game I love with Mafia 3 (and an idea I love with Rhapsody , its sadly canned post-Mafia-3 project), and I want to see more from both. So, regardless of my cold feelings toward the game, I'm glad to hear The Old Country did well enough to appease Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K's parent company, Take-Two. Zelnick told The Game Business that Mafia: The Old Country's sales had surpassed Take-Two's internal expectations—though he didn't say what those expectations were—and that \"What we suspected was confirmed.\" What did Zelnick and company suspect? \"If you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.\" Which sounds to me like Take-Tw…",

The MX Master 4 is taller at its peak, for a start. It's also a touch longer, a touch chonkier, and now comes with a substantial rounded ridge along the left side where the horizontal scroll wheel resides. The main buttons feel different, too, as they're now nestled inside a semi-translucent coating that strikes as one of the more bizarre additions I could think of adding to a mouse redesign. It's like they're trapped in some sort of see-thru amber, which means if you hold the mouse up to the light, you can see through the tips.

The memory price crisis has come at my least favourite time: a time when it inconveniences me . You can have your early 2025 GPU shortage, that's fine. That didn't affect me, but this does, therefore it's bad. That's a valid argument, trust me, I did logic 101. You see, I considered upgrading my entire build a few months ago, but I put it off because the start of a new GPU generation isn't my favourite time to upgrade. So I came up with my cunning plan: I would wait until next year when hopefully RTX 50-series Super cards launch, and then I'd pounce.

Instead of stumbling around Dam Battlegrounds, Spaceport, and Buried City, here's exactly where you need to go to complete each step of Greasing Her Palms. Take note that you'll need to hang onto the Dam Surveillance Key that Celeste gives you upon accepting this quest because you'll need it to complete the relevant objective. How to complete Greasing Her Palms in Arc Raiders You'll need to visit three specific locations across three different maps for Greasing Her Palms, which'll take you quite some time.

In a post on Reddit , user Retrotom explains the steps they followed to get Nvidia's DGX Spark to natively run Cyberpunk 2077. The little 'AI-supercomputer-in-a-box' sports a GB10 APU, which has a 20-core Arm CPU and a Blackwell-based GPU with 6,144 shader cores. Cyberpunk 2077 runs on DGX Spark from r/nvidia The latter is, to all intents and purposes, the same GPU that's in a GeForce RTX 5070 . Same number of shaders, TMUs, ROPs, ray tracing units, tensor cores, and L2 cache. Where they differ is in VRAM and power. While the GB10 sports 128 GB of LPDDR5x unified memory across a 256-bit wide memory bus for 273 GB/s of bandwidth, the GB205 in the RTX 5070 is home to 12 GB of GDDR7.

This week, Collins Dictionary posted a blog celebrating and explaining its choice for the Word of the Year (via The Register ). Vibe coding is relatively contentious in itself. Generative AI has been widely criticised for flagrantly ignoring copyright and for its adoption by investors declaring it's the next big thing in games, movies, or whatever art form you hold dear. And that's because there are productivity gains to be made in skipping through all the manual work of creative labour. Of course, that comes with its own set of problems. An overreliance on the black box that is generative AI can make coders less able to actually fix their own problems when they inevitably pop up.

Trials provides more challenges for players to complete during excursions, like damaging Hornets, searching new wave husks, or destroying Ticks, Fireballs, and Pops, alongside the quests that different raiders from Speranza give you. For each challenge, there are three milestones at 1,000 points, 2,500 points, and 4,000 points, and each milestone will reward you with a better mystery prize. (Image credit: Embark Studios) At first, I thought that these were easier quests that I could simply tick off my to-do list without thinking too much about it, and while challenges at the lower levels aren't too difficult, it often takes a dedicated run to complete them. This is because you don't gather progress over multiple runs, you have to complete the challenge in one go. \"Raider Trials have raised a few questions, so here's the 101,\" an official Arc Raiders social media post says. \"Progress only counts per single sur…",

Case in point: on Tuesday colony builder Generation Exile dropped on Steam to a total of three user reviews, despite a seasoned indie team behind it. Studio founder Nels Anderson was previously the lead designer of masterful stealth game Mark of the Ninja before co-founding Campo Santo to make Firewatch. Generation Exile's team also includes Karla Zimonja, designer on Gone Home and Tacoma, and Niamh Fitzgerald, lead designer of hit traffic sim Mini Motorways . Oh, and a soundtrack from FTL and Into the Breach composer Ben Prunty!? Maybe the problem is the Steam page doesn't mention that the game's got capybaras in it .

For studios planning a November 2026 launch, that nightmare became reality today when Take-Two announced a new delay . GTA 6 was originally slated to release on consoles in Fall 2025—around now!—before its initial delay to May 2026. If you look at the major games releasing in May 2026 as of now, you'll notice there's basically nothing because everything is shambling to escape Rockstar's orbit. And while it's true that May isn't usually a busy month for blockbuster game releases, in 2025 we saw Doom: The Dark Ages and Revenge of the Savage Planet hit PC, both of which would be cremated alive in a battle against GTA. Speaking anonymously to The Game Business on the announcement of GTA 6's first delay , the \"boss of one of the world's biggest game publishers\" admitted that Rockstar sucks a lot of money and time out of the market and that \"we don't want to be anywhere near that.\" Another anonymous s…",

It clarified a few basic things, like being able to buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance (and therefore with in-game gold via WoW tokens) and that it intends to keep the catalog small compared to what you can earn by playing the game. \"Housing items tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop,\" it says. \"Thematically important decor that players know and love will also not appear in the shop.\" Then it went on to explain why it's adding a premium currency in the first place, especially when it already sells mounts and cosmetics for real money values. In addition to providing \"appropriate financial protections for both parties\"—whatever that means—Blizzard says it's to help players purchase multiple items at once. \"As an example, you may want a full set of chairs to place around a dining table, multiple …",

Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it. Tavern Keeper's tutorial is almost shockingly brief: after plopping you into a rundown pub in a gloomy swamp, you run through the basics of how to buy kegs of booze and serve them to customers, hire workers and assign them jobs, and order supplies that can be cooked into meals.

Reading a recent blog by longtime Windows developer Raymond Chen, I realized that when '80s computer geeks used the term, its meaning was completely flipped. \"The term 'online' originally meant 'immediately available on a computer,\" Chen wrote, explaining why Windows 3.0 (which was released in 1990) included WinHelp, a program built for browsing \"online\" help files.
