Before we entered the building, we were already discussing one of the products yet to be announced, the Steam Frame. For many, this announcement will not come as a complete surprise, as intrepid detectives glean information from even the slightest breadcrumb left by Valve in the months ahead of the launch. This time, a trademark for the name 'Steam Frame' gave away the Deckard project's real name ahead of our visit, but Deckard rumours have been rife for years. Some more accurate than others, but generally not miles off when you piece it all together. But is this some sort of clever scheme by Valve to drum up support or test out the popularity of ideas on dedicated fans? No, apparently not. That's right from the horse's mouth, too, and if you take this as further proof of some sort of grand plan, I have a bridge to sell you. Stood in a room surrounded by Valve engineers that drew the short straw in having to talk to press, I raised the question, how do they feel when someone gets near-definitive proof of something like the Steam Frame early?

It sounds like a medical issue but I assure you, it's all about ensuring the Steam Frame's wireless connection is strong, stable, and appears high quality. The Steam Frame offers a few ways to play games, both locally on its own Arm chip and streamed from a nearby gaming PC. As the name suggests, foveated streaming is used during the latter. \"So, a lot of people might have heard of foveated rendering,\" Jeremy Selan, an engineer at Valve working on the Steam Frame, says. \"That's where you use the direction you're looking at to optimise what the device is doing. So it only has to do a lot of work in that area. We are doing something similar to that dedicated to the streaming process.\" Foveated streaming requires the Steam Frame's new eye tracking feature. This uses two cameras embedded just above the wearer's eyes, through which Valve can very quickly monitor where a user is looking at any one time. The clearest patch of your vision, that's thanks to your fovea, hence the name. Connecting to a PC via its own wireless adapter and a dedicated 6 GHz connection, the Steam Frame h…",

However, it's also a sign that times are changing, as systems running on Arm are receiving much greater support from Valve. Valve has been largely focused on x86 processors over the years. These chips from AMD and Intel are the dominant player in PC gaming, so it only makes sense as to why. But in recent months, Arm support is seeping into Steam in a variety of ways. SteamOS will receive Arm support with the launch of the Steam Frame sometime next year. I don't suspect you'll be able to take that ISO file and load it onto any old Arm-based device right away, like a modern mobile phone, and have it just work. It's still not possible to stick SteamOS on any gaming PC and have it just work, but it is improving in that regard. The chip powering the Steam Frame isn't unique to the headset, however.

Valve sees the Steam Frame as both an accessory and a gaming PC. It's right to do so.

Valve's hot hardware (Image credit: Future) Steam Frame : Valve's new wireless VR headset Steam Machine : Compact living room gaming box Steam Controller : A controller to replace your mouse But that's fundamentally missing the point. With this new ecosystem launch, Valve has just pried Microsoft's last little finger off the previously vice-like grip it once had on PC gaming. No-one needs Microsoft to play PC games anymore—not you, not the devs, not the manufacturers of gaming rigs. Heck, with SteamOS coming to Arm, you may not even need x86 CPUs, either.

Speaking to IGN , design director Justin Wiebe assured players that the studio is \"always listening\". \"As soon as the game launched, we had people kind of looking at all forms of player communication, and taking notes and saying, ‘OK, well, we had planned to do this in live service, but we're hearing that this is a problem for the community',\" Wiebe explained. \"If it's a problem for the community, then let's talk about it.

The idea behind the Steam Controller is that it allows you to interact with your PC while on your sofa or away from a desk with the accuracy of a mouse, without actually requiring one. This is, and always has been, a good idea. Where people differ is on whether the original manifestation of the Steam Controller, first released in 2015, was any good or not. I never used it for long enough to get to grips with it—which was, in large part, the problem with it. Some here at PC Gamer own the controller, but rarely, if ever, used it. Others here actively despise it. I imagine that represents a pretty good cross section of the wider PC gaming community.

I'm wandering around an abandoned building as headcrab zombies shuffle around me. The other people in the room understand this experience all too well—this is Valve HQ and I'm testing out the company's new VR headset for the first time. I'm wearing the Steam Frame. The new standalone headset marking a \"fundamental shift\" in how Valve tackles virtual reality. It includes a system-on-chip and runs SteamOS natively, allowing players to run games without the need for a secondary PC. The Steam Frame is no longer an accessory for a gaming PC. It is the gaming PC. For this demo, however, Half-Life: Alyx is running on a PC nearby. Each frame being rendered on the PC is being streamed over the Steam Frame's dedicated wireless connection. \"To remind you, this is wireless,\" Jeremy Selan, an engineer at Valve who works on the Steam Frame, tells me. I realise I have to remind myself of that as I'm playing. I've tried wireless VR before to mixed success. Sometimes it works pretty flawlessly, other times not so much. The worst experience I had with it was sitting inside a makeshift Fa…",

I've been a part of this weird and wonderful PC gaming world for the better part of three decades at this point, and the one prevailing trend that continues to develop almost exponentially year-on-year is the PC gamer's desire to customize things to exactly how they want them to be. To what's right for them. It started with custom PCs, moved on to keyboards, and is now spilling over into almost every area imaginable in this humble little hobby of ours. This isn't the first time we've seen custom mice; ones with swappable plates and grips have existed before the Pathfinder, but no other comes even close to matching what Orbital provides with this setup. It's utterly astonishing. Is this the best wireless gaming mouse of 2025? Honestly? Probably.

As PC Gamer online editor Fraser Brown said in his review , the \"good, sometimes even great\" bite 'em up \"is a sequel in name only, and it never really enthusiastically embraces being an RPG.\" Regardless, developer The Chinese Room has begun updating the game with fixes and features as teased in a roadmap that debuted in a blog post today. Today's patch, which kicks off the roadmap schedule, includes some welcome polish: a save on exit feature, a crash fix, and two dozen or so assorted bug fixes. The rest of the roadmap stretches beyond a Christmas-themed winter update and into next year, though it's a little light on details; there's a Valentine's Day update, and two DLCs due for the latter part of 2026. In the meantime, the future looks a bit scant. The next major patch will pack a few features that, while nice, aren't exactly glamorous points on a roadmap.

Set in 2002, Agefield High: Rock the School sees you play as Sam, a new student looking to make friends, win over his dream girl, and generally leave his mark on the school social hierarchy. Like Rockstar's 2006 game, Agefield High is set in a school campus and a surrounding slice of open-ended suburbia, with a day/night cycle and a school itinerary you can choose to follow or flaunt. Developer Refugium Games just released a new trailer, showing off in-game cutscenes and mechanics like Sam getting into fistfights, riding a bicycle around town and, well, that's about it, to be honest.

His primary fire can heal allies and damage enemies, like most hitscan Strategists.

    "body": "This might sound ludicrous, but I've never been so happy to see a new gaming laptop release. I was a big fan of the original Framework 16 machine, bringing with it the possibility of a genuinely modular gaming laptop that could grow over the years in the same way a normal desktop rig can. And now here is the theoretically inevitable upgrade, bringing Nvidia's RTX Blackwell architecture as a slot-in option for Framework's 16-incher. I say 'theoretically inevitable' only because that was effectively the promise Framework made upon launch of the original Framework 16 . Yet no other company has managed this feat, with such luminaries as Dell/Alienware being the most notable of failures . So, there's been a little niggle at the base of my brainstem since launch that maybe it might not happen this time, either. Released at the start of 2024, things looked relatively rosy for the Framework 16, with AMD onboard, helping create the modular Radeon 7700S GPU that was to form the backbone of the first graphics expansion bay. Then the red team just kinda gave up on mobile graphics cards for laptops, and that looked more than mildly worrying for the future of this modular gaming notebook. Indee…",

That's been ingrained into my brain ever since the heyday of online forums. So I'm more than a little interested in cyberspace.online , a social media site that is \"how the internet was supposed to be\" (via Hackaday ). The most immediately striking thing about it is its aesthetic, which is pulled straight from my childhood dreams of what hacking would probably be like: green terminals and lots of '@' usernames. You can theme it with any colours and border sizing you like, but it comes with some pre-mades, including C64 , VT320 , and green Matrix options. Personally, while I don't know if I could stand it long-term, I like the VT320 one because it reminds me of Hacker: Evolution .

We got to peep a new trailer showing off Bowser Jr (voiced by Benny Safdie) and the undisputed best princess in the Mario universe Rosalina (Brie Larson) alongside the return of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and a miniature Bowser—who was shrunk at the end of the first movie, if you forgot. Bowser seems to have taken to a bit of a Rapunzel lifestyle, chilling inside a toy-sized castle and painting diabolical works of art where he's a jacked-up hot bro. For whatever reason Bowser Jr.'s debut gets hit with the Prowler sound effect from Into the Spiderverse, and it looks like he'll be replacing his papa as the sequel's antagonist.

Not because he would have made the game differently, but because he hated the term so much, he wanted to change it. Speaking on the Shooter Monthly podcast (via TheGamePost ), Bungie's former director of product management Chris Sides said that he thought about collaborating with the studio's marketing team to come up with a different term for extraction shooters, one that presumably would have been pushed in the runup to Marathon's launch. The reason for this, Sides says, is the vagueness of the term. \"The problem is Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it's not. The genre name is so bad. I hate the genre name of extraction shooter.

Essentially, it adds LLM-powered AI agents directly into Minecraft, which respond to your commands and play alongside you. This means you'll have a gaggle of Steves to boss around and ask to do tasks you simply cannot be bothered to do, or the ones you need some extra help with, like culling a bunch of sheep or mining for a specific resource.

They have everything you could possibly need to get through the day, from some of the best snacks you never knew you needed to delicious counter food like the renowned Famichiki. Last night's State of Play trailer for inKnobini: One store. Many stories renewed the excitement I felt after playing inKonbini's short demo over the summer. Set in '90s rural Japan, it captures the unique energy Japanese convenience stores have—there's a sense of care and reverence to truly provide a service to the community. I wouldn't want to do a Tesco simulator , but this, I like. As someone who works in customer service, it's not something you'd think I'd want to replicate in my downtime—that being said, I took a busmans holiday in Two Point Museum this year and thoroughly enjoyed it—but Two Point has a knack for turning the mundane into goofy Aardman-style skits. You're not down on the ground dealing with customers, happily disconnected from the associated chaos that can bring. InKonbini takes a very different approach and changed…",

Each augment of this level also has perks attached to it, such as the Tactical MK3 Healing augment that releases a cloud of healing smoke once revived from being down, and is on a 30-second cooldown. (Image credit: Embark) But the one that stands above the rest has to be the Looting MK3 Survivor with a perk that lets players regenerate up to 75% of their max downed health while downed and stationary. This, in and of itself, is ridiculously strong, giving teammates ample time to come and revive you mid or post-skirmish, but some players have found a way to make it even stronger. \"MK3 augment is a lifesaver,\" bior12 says on the Arc Raiders subreddit . \"A very tense 15 minutes.\" The video alongside this post shows bior12 crawling across the Buried City map while being downed for 15 minutes all the way to an extractio…",
