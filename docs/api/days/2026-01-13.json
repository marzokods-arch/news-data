Joining Yoakam and his band during the Grammy week show will be Charley Crockett, Marcus King and Lukas Nelson , with more guests to be announced. Both Crockett and Nelson are nominated for Grammys for best traditional country album at the Feb. 1 ceremony. Double Grammy winner Yoakam, who will perform a full show with his band, is presenting the concert, along with Billy Bob Thornton and director/producer McG, who will emcee the event. The concert is borne out of Yoakam and his wife Emily’s own time spent at CHLA several years ago when their son was checked for a potentially serious medical issue by the hospital’s senior vp and surgeon-in-chief Dr. Mark Krieger that led to a healthy outcome. Yoakam had just participated in a live-stream benefit for the Ronald McDonald House located across the street from CHLA and his wife had previously volunteered at Vanderbilt Children’s Hospital in Nashville and they were eager to find a way to give back. “When you walk the hall…",

    "body": "TL;DR Translate appears to be working on an AI-powered button that offers alternatives to what you’re trying to translate. The alternatives may convey slightly different meaning, or offer different levels of formality. Google could introduce this option alongside the “Understand” and “Ask” buttons we saw earlier. Many of us have spent the last couple years learning that modern AI does some things a whole lot better than others. While it sometimes misreports facts, “ hallucinating ” details, it tends to do a pretty decent job at stringing a few words together — even incorrect results don’t end up sounding like gibberish. That makes translation a pretty obvious target for AI’s skill set, and today we’ve spotted what looks like some new AI-powered functionality Google’s working on for its Translate app. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

The Pixel 10a is rumored to be launching in the next few weeks. We first saw unofficial renders of the Pixel 10a published by Android Headlines back in October . Today, the outlet is back at it with a leak of what it says is the first official render published of Google’s upcoming midranger. There’s nothing surprising in the render itself, but the timing of the leak does line up nicely with a rumor from earlier this morning pointing to a 10a release in the coming weeks. The render Android Headlines published today shows a purported Pixel 10a that looks nearly indistinguishable from last year’s Pixel 9a at a glance, though size and layout of the camera cutout, flash, and Google G lettermark are all subtly different. The phone in the render is sporting some considerably thick bezels, a notable difference from previous (unofficial) CAD renders, which featured a thinner border around the phone’s display.",

You can still pre-order from Batch 2 at the early-bird pricing, with shipments starting on January 15. The move follows similar RAM-related issues affecting other Android gaming handhelds. Another day, another Android handheld feeling the squeeze from rising RAM prices. This time, AYN has confirmed that its dual-screen Thor will get more expensive when the next batch of pre-orders opens later this month. The good news is there’s still a brief window to lock in the current pricing, if you’re quick. According to an update shared on AYN’s Discord (via NotebookCheck ), the company will raise prices when Batch 3 pre-orders open on January 20. AYN directly attributes the increase to higher memory costs. As a result, the Base model will go up by $10, while the Pro and Max variants will each see a $20 bump.",

You’ll see a special animation if you search for terms related to the anniversary, like “America’s 250th.” This Easter egg will stay around until July 4, 2026. Google often likes to celebrate special occasions by sneaking Easter eggs into Search. So if you happen to search for something that’s related to the Easter egg, you just may be treated to a fun little surprise. For example, back when Wicked was released, you could see your search results float away if you searched for the movie. Now Google has a new surprise waiting for users interested in America’s independence. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The good news is that all the unlockable characters are now available without any extra effort. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",

However, one of the most important factors is customer support, as the last thing you want is poor service in the event of an issue. Unfortunately, Redditor Competitive-Split584 recently outlined their horrible Google Pixel customer support experience. The user claimed that their Pixel 8 Pro developed a hardware fault related to Wi-Fi, so they contacted customer support. Google’s own system apparently showed that the device was still under warranty. The user was apparently promised an “advanced exchange,” but the ordeal is still ongoing after four weeks and 22 different customer support representatives. Agents even purportedly claimed that the user received “incorrect” information in the first place.",

While the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled in favor of AT&amp;T, the 2nd Circuit ruled in favor of the government over Verizon. The Supreme Court is now being asked to step in and make a final ruling that will apply to both, though the decision won’t likely arrive until the summer of 2026. After it determined Verizon and AT&amp;T had willfully violated the law by failing to protect customer location data, the FCC previously ordered AT&amp;T and Verizon to pay roughly $57 million and $47 million, respectively. While both companies paid the fines as expected, they also opted to sue over the matter independently. Now the Supreme Court is getting involved as well, as reported by The Hill .

The multiple systems can offer a combined power output of 90kW. As part of its CES 2026 showcase, Anker’s sub-brand SOLIX gave us a preview of its new integrated home backup solution, the SOLIX E10. Following up on its preview last week, the company is now disclosing details about the products. SOLIX says the E10 is the world’s first “smart hybrid whole home backup system.” While the other bits are self-explanatory, hybrid here refers to its ability to run on multiple fuel options.

AYANEO has been a trailblazer in retro gaming handheld designs, but when it comes to customer service, it lags far behind the competition. Crowdfunded products are frequently delayed for months with little to no communication, and after-market support is both slow and often ineffective. Things came to a head in the past few weeks, with many fans and popular reviewers such as Retro Handhelds , Retro Game Corps , and others openly criticizing the company’s practices and even threatening a boycott.

I keep going back for another bite at the apple, hoping to find the one pair that finally works for me. This time, that meant trying on Viture’s new flagship, The Beast. Based on their specs, I figured these might be the XR glasses I’d been waiting for, so I headed to the Venetian, ducked behind a door, and ended up in the world of Pandora. Here’s how it went.",

    "body": "TL;DR Apple finished 2025 as the world’s top smartphone brand in terms of units shipped, extending its lead over Samsung thanks to faster year-on-year growth. Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",

A new report has revealed when you can actually get your hands on these phones. Dealabs reports that the Galaxy S26 phones will be released in Europe on March 11, which means you can visit a store on this date and pick them up. The outlet adds that this date applies to other regions as well. It also corroborated earlier leaks of a February 25 unveiling.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has been using the same camera sensors on its Galaxy S Ultra devices since 2023. This could change next year with the Galaxy S27 Ultra, slated to feature an upgraded sensor. Latest leak says that while the camera will have the same format, it will pack newer technologies, though details are rife at the moment. Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy S26 series soon, most likely in the last week of February. But even with weeks remaining for one of Samsung’s biggest unveilings of the year, leaks and rumors about Samsung’s next generation of flagships are already gushing in. While Samsung has slept on upgrading the hardware, specifically the camera, over the last few generations of its Galaxy S series phones, the Galaxy S27 Ultra may finally bring some improvements. Last week, we leaned into the possibilities of these upgrades, suggesting that three of the four rear cameras on the Galaxy S27 Ultra could be upgraded to newer sensors . And today, we’re learning a bit more about the primary camera sensor. According to the leaker Ice Universe , the Galaxy S27 Ultra will be stocked with a new camera sensor, which is expected to be called …",

Even the early beta catalog gave me access to far more music than I could ever hope to fit on my iPod Nano, and, more importantly, made discovering new artists and exploring new genres unbelievably easy. Many of us probably owe a huge debt to streaming platforms for shaping our musical tastes and expanding our libraries. While the music streaming space has grown with both bigger libraries and a variety of new players, many of today’s top streaming platforms are quickly morphing into the very antithesis of the formula that made them such a game-changer. Unsurprisingly, it’s driven by that most modern of problems: AI slop.",

They’ve stood for the best of the smart features and AI capabilities the smartphone world has ever seen, and have often led from the front. Compared to the AI features Pixels have been offering for years, like Magic Eraser, Apple Intelligence barely holds ground. I was mighty impressed by the Pixel 10 that launched last year, and I genuinely think it’s a better phone than even the Pro model. Yet, I still feel the Pixel 10 series just wasn’t enough. There’s only so much Google can do to improve the Pixel 10 series through software updates — and to be fair, it does quite a lot. But as we enter 2026, my hopes are firmly placed on the Pixel 11. We still have a few months before the next Pixel launches, but I want to use this time to share my wishlist with Google.",

The first is that some of these apps simply don’t serve me anymore, whether due to a lack of functionality or a price point that’s become too high. The second is that switching to a new app I’ll use regularly is actually a fun process for me. It gives me that boost of energy I need to kick off the year on the right note.",

Between years of data archives, larger photo files, and even larger 4K video-first content capture being the norm, for many of us, it has morphed into a significant monthly bill that we aren’t really in a position to cancel. Over here at Android Authority , we’ve talked about Network Attached Storage, or NAS , as a solution for the privacy-conscious or the tech-savvy enthusiasts who want to de-Google their lives and reduce their cloud dependence. We’ve even talked about data sovereignty and actually owning your files in a world that desperately wants you to rent them.

Most smart glasses aren’t explicitly made to be accessibility tools, but it’s easy to imagine ways they could be used to that end.

The feature was announced months ago, but now, it’s rolling out in a limited test.

The V1TAL is easily the most polarizing of the two, so let’s start there.

We now have our first visual proof that Perplexity AI is Bixby’s new brain. A new Bixby Live interface hints at real-time AI conversations, mirroring Gemini Live capabilities. Samsung’s Bixby has spent the better part of the decade being the assistant we love to disable, but the new One UI 8.5 update could make that decision harder. Rather than competing directly with Google Gemini, Samsung is reportedly following Apple’s lead by bringing in stronger AI support . We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ). In these images, Bixby sends complex questions to Perplexity instead of using its own limited knowledge. The responses look more like well-researched answers, complete with citations.",

And one of its priorities is likely to build a folding inner screen without a visible crease. In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands.
