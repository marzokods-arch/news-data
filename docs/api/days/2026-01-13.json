    "body": "On December 10, 2025, Rockstar added a long-requested feature to GTA Online, and one that most fans feel is a trial run for an even more detailed rollout in the next iteration of the sandbox: a mission creator. Allowing players to \"design and publish\" their own missions within GTA Online, creators can set and tweak objectives, characters and mechanics to create their own scenarios, and then share them with the wider playerbase. An omnipresent hazard with community creation tools is content created in bad taste, and soon enough Rockstar had an absolute all-timer on its hands. One player used the tools to put together a mission called \"We are Charlie Kirk\", in which players recreate the assassination of the rightwing political commentator and content creator Charlie Kirk. Kirk was making a public appearance at Utah Valley University in September last year when he was shot and killed. His alleged killer is in custody and awaiting trial, with prosecutors intending to seek the death penalty. To briefly explain the GTA Online mission: the player spawns on a roof overlooking a crowd and a small tent, which approximates the layout seen at Utah Valley University.

It's an extraction shooter, and if you get one of those off the ground, it'll continue to be popular. Its largest impact on the industry has been the conversation around AI . The game's developed by Embark Studios, creators of The Finals , and has routinely dipped its toes into hot water over the usage of generative AI to produce voice lines. Statements have sometimes even contradicted each other. For example, in the story I just linked, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund was quick to emphasise that the studio wasn't using it to \"replace people\", even though replacing work you'd otherwise need a voice actor to come in and record is, uh, doing that. He then goes on to talk effusively about how Embark couldn't have made its two games without it, which strikes me as strange—either you replaced work that would've cost money you didn't have, or you didn't do that. I digress: You might think that after gathering some success, Embark would keep banging that drum. But in a recent interview with PCGN , …",

Amistech hasn't been resting on its laurels since then, though. While PC Gamer was taking its big holiday nap, My Winter Car launched in early access. Videogame sequels usually come with the caveat that it's totally OK to skip the original. Even if doing so actually seems a bit absurd, like a direct follow-up to a story-driven RPG. It makes sense: devs don't want to give people too many reasons not to pick up their new game. But My Winter Car is a sequel to a game that was specifically advertised as \"not fun\". It's not going for mass appeal. Instead of the challenge level starting from scratch, it's meant to build on the trials and tribulations you faced in the original game. It features \"added challenge for those who can master the original game,\" the Steam page warns. Given the complexity of My Summer Car, this means you're probably going to have an absolutely horrible time, which for games like this is absolutely a selling point.

Trump said his administration is working with AI companies in unspecified ways to ensure this does not happen. (Image credit: Donald Trump) He also revealed that Microsoft will be the first such company to announce measures later this week entailing non-specific \"major changes\". The President emphasised the importance of AI companies but said they must nevertheless pay their own way when it comes to energy. \"We are the 'HOTTEST' Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must 'pay their own way,'\" Trump said. Trump also called out the previous Biden administration and \"Radical Left\" for a claimed 30% spike in energy prices for average American households.

But, if you're just going about Minecraft as normal, you might feel as if you haven't been making the most of all these shiny new features. Fortunately, the Dungeon Descent Add-On may be the thing to change that, adding even more features to the game to help test your new spear-wielding skills. If you're an avid fighter, the randomly generated dungeons this DLC adds to Minecraft are bound to be the selling point. These will challenge you to use every attack the spear offers, pitting you against multiple mobs in different rooms but offering some valuable loot in exchange. According to the official blog post announcing the DLC , mining out of these dungeons \"won't be easy\" either, so you really should focus on brushing up your skills. To coincide with this new challenge, training dummies are available as part of the DLC too. So, you won't be entirely left to your own devices to master the art of the spear before plunging into a dungeon or being tasked with leaving your base at night to take down hordes of enemies. These dummies come in four variation…",

SK Hynix is one of Nvidia's leading suppliers of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for its AI accelerators. The planned chip packaging facility is set to begin construction this April, but won't be able to address demand until after work is complete in late 2027 (via Bloomberg ). This follows news last year of the company committing an additional $500 billion to building four new memory fabs , with the first of these aiming for a similar 2027 completion window. Chey Tae-won, the chairman of SK Hynix's parent group, SK Group, recently spoke during a keynote speech at the SK AI Summit in Seoul, saying, \"We have entered an era in which supply is facing a bottleneck. We are receiving memory chip supply requests from many companies, and we are thinking hard about how to address all demands.” With the limited flow of memory now actively restricting how many data centres can be built, it's not the only company announcing pla…",

    "body": "كيف أنهى ريال مدريد عقد ألونسو دون أعباء؟ كشفت تقارير صحفية إسبانية عن تفاصيل مالية مهمة في عقد تشابي ألونسو مع نادي ريال مدريد، بعد إعلان إقالته من منصبه، عقب خسارة لقب كأس السوبر الإسباني أمام برشلونة. وبحسب ما أوردته إذاعة COPE، فإن ريال مدريد كان قد أدرج بندًا واضحًا في عقد ألونسو، ينص على أن النادي غير ملزم بدفع قيمة العقد كاملة الممتد لثلاث سنوات، في حال إقالته خلال الموسم الأول، على أن يحصل المدرب فقط على راتبه عن هذا الموسم. وأوضح التقرير أن إدارة ريال مدريد ستكتفي بسداد مستحقات ألونسو الخاصة بالسنة الجارية فقط، دون أي تعويض إضافي عن العامين المتبقيين، وهو ما يعكس السياسة الصارمة التي يتبعها النادي في تعاقداته مع الأجهزة الفنية. ويأتي هذا التطور بعد ساعات من إعلان ريال مدريد رسميًا إنهاء ارتباطه بتشابي ألونسو، عقب الخسارة أمام برشلونة بنتيجة 3-2 في نهائي كأس السوبر الإسباني، الذي أُقيم في المملكة العربية السعودية. وكان ألونسو قد تولى تدريب ريال مدريد في الصيف الماضي، خلفًا للإيطالي كارلو أنشيلوتي، الذي غادر لتولي قيادة منتخب البرازيل، وسط آمال كبيرة ببدء مرحلة فنية جديدة، إلا أن تذبذب النتائج وغياب الاستقرار، إضافة إلى خسارة الكلاسيكو في مباراة نهائية، عجّلت بإنهاء التجربة. وفي السياق ذاته، لم يترك ريال مدريد مجالًا للتكهنات، وأعلن مباشرة تعيين الإسباني ألفارو أربيلوا مدير…",

To that result, I say: \"Rigged!!\" Okay, not rigged. But I believe I'll be vindicated by history in declaring this miraculous detective game, designed largely by a single mind over the course of eight years , as the game of 2025. I fought hard for Blue Prince to get PC Gamer's top GOTY honor, because I really don't think there's anything else like it out there.

In a Steam news post titled \"AI is bad, game will be deleted 30.1,\" Rakuel developer Eero Laine says his roguelike rock-paper-scissors game Hardest, which features AI-generated art and music assets, will be delisted from Steam at the end of the month. Since releasing the game in July 2025, Laine says his attitudes about AI asset generation have changed enough that deleting the game is \"ethically\" the only rational choice. Laine explains that he used generative AI for Hardest's development \"because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free.\" \"But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment,\" Laine says. His game's mere existence, he says, could be used to help justify investment in AI companies—companies that he says \"bene…",

Originally planned to roll out in December, the DIY microtransactions didn't end up going live until January 9 , immediately after which things started going sideways. Steal the Brainrot, one of the most popular third-party games on Fortnite, moved very quickly to take advantage of the new policy once it went alive, and it was not especially gentle in its approach. As noted by IGN , Steal the Brainrot now offers a \"Present Rot\" bundle for 4,900 V-Bucks—that's $37, if you buy a bundle of 5,000 V-Bucks. (Image credit: Epic Games) You can also, if you like, spin a virtual wheel for a shot at various in-game effects or small amounts of cash—for 100 V-Bucks a spin.

Now, breaking ground on a new fab to actually manufacture memory chips might be a bit beyond the wit of even the most enthusiastic DIY'er. But where there's a will... The modder, who goes by the handle VIK-on, used a pair of 16 GB DDR5 laptop SODIMMs as a starting point. The next step was to source a compatible PCB with the aim of combining all 32 GB onto a single homebrew DIMM. Reportedly, the total cost of the build was $218, about a third of the going rate in Russia for a 32 GB DDR5 stick. Nice. VIK-on also looked into using even cheaper 8 GB sticks to source memory chips, but it seems the chip packaging raises problems when it comes to creating 32 GB sticks.

Which is fair, works in progress are, indeed, works in progress . It'll really depend on which direction Larian swings the needle—D&D's action economy has a heavy reliance on crowd control, given you only have one action per turn (alongside a bonus action and movement). While DoS2 was also crowd-control heavy, you also had a bunch of action points to spend—which, via certain abilities, could be refreshed, allowing for some …",

Anyway, over the weekend (Sunday, to be exact), Steam broached the 42 million concurrent user limit, hitting a new record of 42,042,778 users online at the same time (per SteamDB ). Not a bad way to kick off the year, if you're a titanic videogame storefront. Which, yes, on the one hand, is hardly a surprise. Steam's growth has been relentless and undaunted for ages. It hit 41 million in October , 40 million in March , and 39 million in December 2024 . I suspect I will see you back here in a few months when it hits 43 million. On and on it goes. But!

Huang reflects on the AI naysayers in a recent interview with No Priors (via Business Insider ). The Nvidia leaders and No Priors hosts Elad Gil and Sarah Guo venture down a lot of paths during the nearly 80-minute conversation, including what happens to jobs under an AI future, and when we might see a 'god AI'. One key point is the various narratives around the ethics of the machine learning tech. Huang argues the world of the future is one where AI leads to more jobs: \"People say, 'gosh, all of these robots that we're talking about. It's going to take away jobs'. As we know very clearly, we don't have enough factory workers. Our economy is actually limited by the number of factory workers we have.\" Huang therefore argues that robotics will lead to a huge repair industry, and that will naturally lead to more jobs.

Even then Anthem had its diehards, and the patches and updates that followed addressed some of its more significant flaws. Not enough to save it unfortunately, but enough to guarantee a small but dedicated community of Freelancers who have suited up and returned to Fort Tarsis for the final day before EA pulls the plug on Anthem for good . Our Lauren Morton is one of the players who logged on to say goodbye. \"It's not empty,\" she says, \"but it is quiet.\" There are Twitch streamers running missions until the end, and high-level veterans \"waving and jumping and emoting\" around the Launch Bay.

But there is one specific bird sound, a tremolo warble that I know from Age of Empires, which I seem to hear more than anything else. Mostly it's in pop songs. It plays repeatedly over the outro of Anaconda by Nicki Minaj , and you can hear it in Babylon by Lady Gaga . It's in Pacific State by 808 State and Animals Beat by Skrillex . It's in multiple tracks by Aphex Twin. I think it's in Michael Jackson's Thriller, but that might be a different sample of the same call, and I'm halfway convinced it's been used in heavily processed form in Lana Del Rey's Million Dollar Man . According to Who Sampled , it's in at least 190(!) tracks. Basically, anywhere someone wants things to sound a bit wild and maybe like you're in the jungle, this is the go-to bird cry.

Between you and your target is an army of pipe-wielding, pistol toting goons desperate to wrap their lips around the barrel of your shotgun.

Various reasons have been aired for these problems, ranging from overeager profit chasing, to mismanagement and the malign influence of private equity, alongside broader market influences like audiences playing fewer new games . But former Assassin's Creed director Alexandre Amancio thinks the problems are more fundamental than these influences. Indeed, he believes they go right to the heart of how gaming's biggest studios are currently structured. Speaking to GamesIndustry, Amancio, who directed both Assassin's Creed: Unity and Assassin's Creed: Revelations , said that the sheer size of modern development teams makes both sustainability and innovation extremely difficult: \"There's this theory that says whenever humans create something that surpasses a hundred people, it completely changes the dynamic of it.

It seems Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse are keen to maintain that momentum in 2026. In a Steam update , Hooded Horse's CEO Tim Bender provided a detailed rundown of what's coming to the management sim this year. The most immediate planned change is a new upgrade level for the Burgage Plot—Manor Lords' basic homestead that can be expanded and tailored to a variety of uses. Burgage plots currently have three upgrade levels, but Slavic Magic is adding a new level, which exists between 2 and 3. \"Its goal is to more smoothly bridge the gap between early and late-game housing\", Bender explains. Alongside this, Slavic Magic is also considering shifting certain workshop progressions to later in the game, tying baker extensions to level 3 Burgage Plots to encourage use of the early-game communal oven, and also doing the same with cobbler ext…",
