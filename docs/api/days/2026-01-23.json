We’ve been less than impressed with Now Brief , finding that it rarely has anything of use to show you. On a recent work trip to London, I decided to put some effort into making it useful, and to my surprise, I was successful. Now Brief tries to be a travel companion Of all of the things Now Brief is supposed to be able to do, I wanted it to show me ETAs for upcoming events. The idea is simple — Now Brief looks at calendar events with a tagged location, checks where you are, and then works out when you should leave to get there on time. If that sounds familiar to you, that’s probably because that’s one of the many useful things that Google Now did back in the day.",

Epic will pay Google for services; Google gets deeper access to Unreal Engine and will help promote Epic’s products on Android. Judge James Donato questioned if this deal diluted Epic’s fight for broader Android reforms. After years of heated antitrust battles , Google and Epic Games have shocked the tech world with a secret, massive partnership now coming to light. The surprise was revealed during this week’s court hearing, when it emerged that the two rivals had agreed to a $800 million, six-year strategic partnership, The Verge reports. Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney even hinted at the news on X , calling it “spicy details from the Epic v. Google settlement hearing!”",

The malware is found on certain games distributed through inappropriate app stores, but some have also been found in Xiaomi’s GetApps app store. AI is designed to make our lives easier, but it’s also adept at making them more difficult. AI-powered tools are becoming increasingly popular among hackers , who can now launch sophisticated attacks that stray from established patterns. One such malware has been detected in a few Android games, and it can be used to commit fraud or attack others through your device. Researchers at Dr. Web (via Bleeping Computer ) have identified a class of trojanware that uses AI to click on ads. According to the researchers, the so-called “clickjacking” malware uses Google’s open-source TensorFlow.js library to run machine learning models to interact with ads inside certain apps or games. Ads are common in free-to-play casual Android games, and some developers may resort to using trojanware to artificially inflate click-through rates, thereby increasing the revenue they generate f…",

For the creation of his third and most recent project, How Did I Get Here? , Louis Tomlinson had lashings of both. On Thursday night, Jan. 22, the British pop singer stopped by NBC&#8217;s The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to discuss the new album, and perform a song from it. “This is the record where I felt really comfortable with it. And I felt really comfortable making it, I really enjoyed the process,” he told the talk-show host. “I even enjoyed doing the promo, which is a new thing for me.” Some of the promo for How Did I Get Here? was accidental. Lucky, even. With the release of its first single “Lemonade,” Tomlinson played the cryptic game. His easter eggs, however, were inadvertently collected by Swifties. “It’s good watching people scramble for that stuff,” he remarked. “Another thing that was cool about it was Taylor Swift’ s fans seemed to get a bit confused, thinking somehow it was related to her album. So, I got free promo.” Tomlinson also reflected on his heady days with One Direction , and how those supercharged moments helped the kid grown into the man he is today. “Every moment, ev…",

The company has reportedly agreed to cover the cost of the phone, medical bills, and cleanup, and has offered $500 per person for pain and suffering. We’ve verified the user’s claims, including the report from the local fire department and Samsung’s offer. Samsung has also shared a statement with Android Authority, stating that its analysis concluded that external force was the cause of the incident. Update: January 23, 2025 (1:36 AM ET): Samsung has now shared an amended statement with us, attributing the incident to “external force.” Since the fire department’s investigation concluded that a thermal runaway event occurred, and per the user’s testimony, the phone was simply charging when the incident occurred, it’s unclear what the company means by referring to external force as the cause of the incident. Here’s the full, amended statement Samsung shared with us:",

Idols had previously peaked at No. 4, following its released in June 2025.

We first previewed this update late last year, and it’s now generally available. Back in October, we got an early look at a new device setup workflow in Google Home. The revamped workflow gives you more ways to connect to third-party devices, letting you search by brand name to find both apps and devices to connect to Google’s smart home platform. Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured. With this new workflow, if neither of those are an option, you can type out the name of the specific device you want to get online to initiate pairing.",

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud. Stephen found that focus particularly useful for building his confidence to practice in the real world.",

An overview video published by Nintendo today explains what the Talking Flower can do. The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button. It seems, well, annoying — and if you’ve played Wonder, you’ll know that’s a faithful adaptation of the character.",

ExoMiner++, a recently updated open-source software package developed by NASA, uses artificial intelligence to help find new transiting exoplanets in data collected by NASA’s missions. NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI) Scientists have discovered over 6,000 planets that orbit stars other than our Sun, known as exoplanets. More than half of these planets were discovered thanks to data from NASA’s retired Kepler mission and NASA’s current TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission. However, the enormous treasure trove of data from these missions still contains many yet-to-be-discovered planets. All of the data from both missions is publicly available in NASA archives, and many teams around the world have used that data to find new planets using a number of techniques. In 2021, a team from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley created ExoMiner, a piece of open-source software that used artificial intelligence (AI) to validate 370 new exoplanets from Kepler data.

If you miss or decline a call, Take a Message can automatically spin into action, informing the caller that you’re unavailable and asking them to record a message. While it sounds like voicemail, the feature uses AI to transcribe the message and automatically store it in your Pixel’s call history, where you can revisit it later. While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well.

The option will likely be under Settings &gt; Location &amp; Privacy, and accessing it will remove the association between your submitted reports and your account. Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports. That could soon change, as Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code suggesting Google could soon let users delete all their contributed reports across incidents, road conditions, transit, and trip issues.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile is increasing its monthly bill by $0.50 per line for certain users. The increase is part of T-Mobile’s Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee, which is now $4.99 a month. This is the second hike of $0.50 since last year, but you’ll be spared if your monthly plan already includes federal taxes and telco fees. If you’re a T-Mobile customer in the US , your bill just went up overnight. That’s because the carrier is adding an auxiliary charge, separate from your monthly payment plan. As of Wednesday, January 21, T-Mobile is increasing its “Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee” to $4.99 per voice line and $2.10 per mobile data line. That’s a $0.50 increase compared to before this date, when the fee per voice line was $3.99. If you have multiple lines in your plan, the total should reflect on your bill starting this month. T-Mobile updated its bill breakdown support page (via Droid-Life ) to reflect the new prices.",

Like Hydra, the platform appears to regenerate as quickly as one of it’s somains is cut back. Earlier this month, shadow library Anna’s Archive, infamous for scraping 300TB of Spotify’s most played songs , suddenly lost its main .org domain. At the time, the site’s operator downplayed the situation, saying that domain takedowns for sites like theirs happen often .

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

After a week with AWOL Vision’s Aetherion Max, it became clear that I don’t have a room with a wall large enough, or a layout flexible enough, to fully take advantage of what this projector can do. And if a review unit can genuinely make you contemplate the whole layout of your home to try and keep it in use, that’s a really good sign. If you have the room, the Aetherion is one of the most technically impressive projectors I’ve used.",

On Android, however, I struggle to find apps with uniquely designed experiences. As long as the app technically does what it’s intended to do, it gets a passing grade for most people.

To get the ball rolling, our own Hadlee Simons gave his breakdown when we ran the poll, ranking major Android brands from worst to best based on how their 2025 played out. He obviously considered the hardware side, but also things like software support, strategy, and whether the brand actually seemed to be moving in the right direction. He ultimately concluded that no OEM deserved the top spot, but second and third positions went to Samsung and OnePlus, respectively. More on the latter of those a bit later, but first, let’s see how closely (or not) you agreed with Hadlee’s analysis by looking at the outcome of that poll.",

When the user asked the assistant why it turned on the light, it falsely claimed the user asked for the light to be switched on. Despite having no record of a recent voice command, the assistant continued to claim that a request had been made. As a perk for Prime members, Amazon recently began upgrading Alexa users to Alexa Plus . While not the case for everyone, some users did not appreciate the forced update. Why would users get upset about a free upgrade? There are various reasons why you may want to stick with the original assistant.

Yesterday, we saw a leak that said Apple’s next flagship phone, the iPhone 18 Pro, might tuck its Face ID sensor under the display, in the process shrinking the now-trademark Dynamic Island cluster and shifting it to the left. Today, another leak corroborates part of that story while contradicting another. Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels. Contrary to yesterday’s leak, though, this one claims that the visible Dynamic Island cutout will stay in the middle of the display.",

Bixby hasn’t seemed like much of a priority for Samsung lately, but it looks like that’s changing with the upcoming One UI 8.5 update. Earlier this morning, Samsung announced a beta for the latest version of its assistant, “upgraded to operate as a conversational device agent” that leverages Perplexity to answer complex questions. Samsung, oddly enough, has since removed its announcement, with its URL currently pointing to a Page not found error. According to the announcement’s text as preserved by Droid Life , the new Bixby will let you control your device’s settings and features by making requests in natural language. For questions about topics other than your phone itself, Bixby will connect to Perplexity to pull info from the web.",

Until Google makes up its mind, users can stop the unintentional rotation by disabling system-wide auto-rotate. Back in September 2025, users began getting annoyed when their phone calls switched to landscape orientation while using the Google Phone app. As it turns out, the Google Phone app had just started supporting landscape UI for calls , and users with auto-rotate enabled on their phones were seeing the intended behavior but mistakenly thought it was a bug. Users are complaining once again that the Phone app is turning to landscape, and, as before, it might still be intended behavior. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Customers may be flagged internally, prompting reps to offer the card proactively via SMS during a visit. You’re still under no obligation to apply, but don’t be surprised if the card comes up quickly and unprompted. If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",
