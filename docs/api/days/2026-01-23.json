The new game is in the hands of Forza Horizon studio Playground Games, which has very little in common with the old Lionhead except for—perhaps crucially—its Britishness. In an interview published by Xbox, Fable game director Ralph Fulton discussed how the studio dealt with taking on a storied series from a once-venerated studio. \"One of the things I said to the team was, ‘Look, we’re not Lionhead—we can’t try to make a Lionhead game.’ This has to be a Playground game because I’m a really firm believer that the personality and the character of a team is visible in the work they do and the games they make.\" Fulton went on: \"And I think you can see Lionhead in that original trilogy. It would be pointless, I think, for us to try and ape that. And that’s really at the heart of the reboot question, right? It felt imperative to me that this was a reboot because we’re starting again as Playground Games, and making Playground’s Fable.\" One sacrosanct part of the Fab…",

Pump the brakes a bit, though: over on Reddit, the new necromancy system wasn't well-received, and many Hytale players took the update as a sign that Hytale's magic and mana system, which is not in the game yet, may be cause for concern. The backlash was loud enough that Hypixel CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme hopped onto Twitter to calm everyone down. \"Just want to add a note, the grimoire is NOT the magic system at all,\" Collins-Laflamme posted . \"Seeing reddit go full panic mode thinking this is what we have in mind for magic is kinda insane, this is just a random drop fun item, it will evolve over time,\" he said.

In DreadBound's first trailer, I clocked instantly deploying spike traps, oil slicks to trip enemies (or set them on fire), Ravenholm-style circular saw projectiles that you can embed in walls and use as platforms to reach high places, and an homage to my favorite quick melee in all of gaming, the Dark Messiah kick. Rather than the handcrafted levels typical of immersive sims, DreadBound will feature \"a cursed city that changes every time you die.\" That gave this Roguelikephobic gamer some pause, but roguelike and immsim, when attempted in the past, have often proven to be a chocolate and peanut butter genre combo.

Does that clear things up for you? Okay, maybe not, so let's recap. The whole thing began when New Blood honcho Dave Oshry said the studio's stealth FPS Blood West saw a 200% increase in sales on Steam while it was available for free on the Epic Games Store over the holidays: \"Turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!\" In response, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney took the high road, saying sometimes Steam comes out on top, sometimes Epic does, \"but one thing is constant on every transaction: gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals.\" That sparked a reaction from Larian Studios publishing chief Michael Douse, who retweeted Sweeney to say that although Epic fully funded the development of Alan Wake 2, keeping the game off of Steam may have done more harm than good in the long run: \"This altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial…",

A reviewer by the name of Bad Wolf kicked off the bit about a month ago, saying that while \"everything is great\" about the hotel, \"the only issue is that players sometimes spawn just 10 meters away from me.\" In the weeks since, all but one review—left by guests who enjoyed a \"ski-related stay\"—have been Arc Raiders references, ranging from the simple \"Hey, Raider!

It's a bit of a drive-by in which Turbodriver only briefly touches on topics like being compensated for modding, access to adult content online, and whether he finds his mods controversial. The details about himself he's willing to share (his identity not among them), mostly boil down to not seeing himself as an educator or an activist.

Beast of Reincarnation was first unveiled last June, and its unique visual identity really speaks to me. The beautiful Japanese countryside, mystical elements, and samurai protagonist (complete with wide-brimmed kasa ) remind me of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, but the postapocalyptic world is also suffused with overgrown, rusted megastructures and gangly automatons that call to mind Square Enix's beloved Nier series. And let me be clear: Nier is beloved to me . The NieR connection isn't just visual: Beast of Reincarnation is similarly set thousands of years into Earth's future, where humanity is struggling against a plague of evil magical plants, as well as a distinctly Yoko Taro-flavored race of transhumanist robots gone wrong. \"The Golems are beings created when former humans transferred their souls into mechanical b…",

The series was \"a big pivot\" for Bethesda, best known for the high fantasy of The Elder Scrolls, says lead artist Istvan Pely, who was responsible for much of the game's look: \" It started with the box art .\" One crucial element of that look was the presence of firearms, from pistols to energy blasters, which in Fallout 3 have a kind of chunky and utilitarian feel to them. \"The Fallout guns are very exaggerated, they're almost like caricatures of guns in some qualities,\" says Pely. \"Usually, we try to stick with vintage pre-war realistic guns. But then there's a whole class of the more futuristic stuff, like the energy weapons.\" One of Pely's first designs was the power armour, which turns its wearers into hulking mini-mechs, and this would also feed into how Pely thought about the weapons. \"The assault rifle from Fallout 4 originally didn't start out as an assault rifle, it was meant to be a gun that was scaled and suitable for a guy in massive power armor,\" says Pely. \"In…",

The idea behind it is that everything is player-led. You can set up a market stall full of goods you've made yourself, from armour to flowers, and trade with other players. There's also dungeon diving, where you'll rummage up the gold you need to buy wares from community merchants, and you can join clans and form villages and even castles if you've got enough people playing with you. Despite my preference for solo experiences, the emphasized focus on community building is so far off what I usually go for that it's swung around to interesting for me, and the fact the game is free to play until Monday, January 26 means I'm tempted to dip into it this weekend and see if I gel with it.

After spending a lot of time with this particular mouse, I can confirm this is certainly the market for these mice. But despite me thoroughly enjoying using the Pulsar X2 CrazyLight, it probably won't be the best option out there for many competitive FPS gamers. If you aren't familiar with the company's line-up of gaming mice, looking at Pulsar's product pages can be very confusing. Even just looking at the X2 series , there are a whole bunch of different models there. There are 'A' versions which are ambidextrous, 'H' versions which have a bigger 'hump' to them, and so on, plus different size variations. It's the medium-sized X2 CrazyLight that I've been spending time with, although I have also tried the CrazyLight X2H in mini sizing. Apart from being a little too small for my hand, I also found the hump in the latter too pronounced for my liking and a little distracting, so I've stuck to considering the regular one for this review.

Lucy finally got to the Vault-Tec facility where her dad's cooking up something terrible, more Coop flashbacks, and we finally got a Super Mutant cameo. What's better, he's voiced by none other than Ron Perlman. It's a pretty short scene, the Super Mutant actually rescues the Ghoul from a nasty fate after getting punched out of a window and impaled on a pole, and then drags him to an unknown location, supposedly where other Super Mutants are living. The mutant then asks the Ghoul to join his cause of going after the Enclave. After Coop refuses, he gets knocked out and dragged away from the hideout. (Image credit: Prime Video) That's all the time I needed. I had thought we'd see a Super Mutant at some point in the show, especially after FEV was properly mentioned in the last episode, but I didn't expect they'd get Perlman to voice it. For those unfamiliar with Perlman's previous Fallout work, he voiced the iconic line \"war never changes\" in almost every Fallout game and voiced Butch Harries in Fallout 4—despite his first role in the series paying just $40 and a sandwich .

I am delighted to report, however, that D&D Beyond is doing something unequivocally neat in its partnered content program, and looks set to continue doing neat things with it without screwing up. In case you're unfamiliar, D&D Beyond is a digital tabletop version of the TTRPG that Wizards of the Coast bought in 2022. The content partner program, which has been in effect since 2024, allows folks to integrate their work into D&D Beyond while being compensated for their craft.

No, literally. \"TR-49 is our best launch, ever, in 14 years,\" Ingold writes on Bluesky . \"I admit I'm surprised! Made in nine months, mostly as an experiment to learn Godot, and an excuse to play with some actors.

Ingold was a mathematical consultant on The Imitation Game, the movie about Alan Turing inventing the first computer to break the Enigma code in World War 2, so this seems right up his alley. The reveal that TR-49 was made in just nine months is very impressive on its own. The fact that it's also the best launch Inkle has ever had makes it even more so.

Eventually, towards the tail end of 2025, the situation resolved, and you could pick up all kinds of GPUs for considerably less than their MSRPs. Now, thanks to the global memory supply crisis, graphics cards sporting 16 GB or more of VRAM are all shooting back up in price. In November of last year, you could bag yourself a 16 GB RTX 5060 Ti , RTX 5070 Ti , or RTX 5080 for $400, $745, or $990, respectively. Today, those same graphics cards are, at best, $450, $829, and $1,268. That might not seem particularly bad, especially in light of just how expensive they were at launch, but those prices are the very best around. For example, B&H's cheapest 16 GB RTX 5060 Ti is $630 , and should you want an RTX 5070 Ti from Best Buy , you'll need to hand over $1,199.

That should broaden support and reduce the number of existing PC games that won't run on Arm PCs.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves: Update 2 is currently available in pre-release testing (enable this via the launcher's settings menu), and if all goes well, it should be in everyone's hands come Friday or Saturday, suggests Collins-Laflamme. The standout feature of Update is no doubt its improved mining experience. Pickaxes have been reworked to make higher-quality picks mine faster (frankly, I was baffled that wasn't how they worked initially). Building on that, while WorldGen V2 still isn't here, Hypixel has changed how ores are spawned. Namely, major ores are better distributed between the tiered zones, and there's much more ore overall, especially in the Devastated Lands. I still think Lucky Mining is one of the best Hytale mods , but these changes go a long way in making mining and gear progression feel more rewarding. Another major…",

The best Arknights: Endfield characters are strong either because they're great at a very specific role, such as how Xaihi is the meta Cryo support character, or they're super versatile, like how Ardelia and Akekuri will work in basically any team comp. Still, there are team combos for each art which are very strong when put together. Some of these are more free-to-play friendly than others, with Electric and Physical/Cryo making for great free teams, while mono-Physical squads are currently among the most costly if you want them to perform at peak. Whatever you choose and whoever you pull, hopefully this will give you an idea of some of the best comps for each art.

Players have been used to comprehensive and game-warpingly powerful combat addons for over 20 years at this point, so of course it's kicking up a fuss. Game director Ion Hazzikostas, who talked to PCG contributor Heather Newman recently , has spent a lot of his time dutifully reassuring players, reiterating intentions, and trying to disarm panic. Now the conversation's shifted in another direction: Has Blizzard gone soft on addons, by walking back some of the changes and specifics? No, says Hazzikostas, that was always the plan. As a matter of fact, when Midnight went into alpha testing, the strategy was to first go scorched-earth and see how much broke. \"I was surprised, and I learned a lot about exactly how many of our add-ons are written in the first few weeks of alpha … We realized pretty quickly that a ton of these add-ons were written …",

Turns out, if you build an entire game around requiring 12 separate WeakAuras (programmable UI elements) and nameplate mods, that's not the best experience for anybody. Even as an experienced player, I spent ages futzing around to get my WeakAuras just-so.

Turns out they vary from absolutely awful to still-kinda-potatovision-but-better-than-you'd-probably-guess, if that's not an unforgivably excessive use hyphenation and compound adjectives. Anywho, to go lower than 720p, for starters you actually have to edit Red Dead Redemption 2's config file. 2kliksphilip first tried 120p base resolution, then 90p. At this point, text and menu controls get very hard to read even given those elements are rendered at the upscaled resolution, which is double the vertical pixel count but still very low.

There are 10 different themes to pick from, each with four skins for various heroes (besides Royal Flush and Futuristic Athleisure, which only have three skins), which you can see below (thanks for collating them, Overwatch Cavalry ): Image 1 of 10 Seven Deadly Sins (Image credit: Blizzard, via Overwatch Cavalry) Image 2 of 10 Street Rollers (Image credit: Blizzard, via Overwatch Cavalry) Image 3 of 10 Neon Pantheon (Image credit: Blizzard, via Overwatch Cavalry) Image 4 of 10 Juice Bar (Image credit: Blizzard, via Overwatch Cavalry) Image 5 of 10 Pirate's Journey (Image credit: Blizzard, via Overwatch Cavalry) Image 6 of 10 G…",

    "body": "World of Warcraft 's pre-patch for the Midnight expansion has introduced a stat squish—in case you're unfamiliar, it's basically required for any long-form MMO. Every so often, Blizzard has to put the clamps on damage numbers and turn everything down, because numbers getting too high is bad for everybody. The idea is that proportionately things stay the same—you're not actually getting any weaker. However, WoW is a 21-year-old game, and sometimes things get a little skewiff. For example: There are now healing potions in World of Warcraft, potions that a first-time player might conceivably pick up, that do literally nothing. As spotted by one user on the game's subreddit , a Minor Healing Potion at the time of writing currently reads: \"Use: Restores 0 health.\" Not one for letting threads fool me, I decided to hop onto my character to verify and, surely enough, there are multiple healing potions and food items that currently restore zero, or \"-0\" health. Dalaran Sharp, Wolf Meat, even my beloved Cactus Apple Surprise. None are safe, left completely devoid of any nutritional value.

    "body": "Creating an Arknights: Endfield tier list isn't quite as difficult as you'd think. Sure, we don't really know who performs best in the endgame yet, and won't until after launch, but similar to Zenless Zone Zero, the usefulness of characters is primarily dependent on which type of team they perform best in. A character can be good because they're versatile and free-to-play friendly, or because they're currently the meta DPS or support for a specific art. Since Arknights: Endfield features elemental arts and combo skills which activate upon fulfilling specific conditions, such as reactions, team comp is the be-all and end-all. Currently, the top-tier teams are cryo and heat (though the latter has far fewer characters), though neither is free-to-play friendly, since they require six-star characters to shine. On the other hand, electric and cryo/physical hybrid teams are very free-to-play friendly, since most of the characters you need are four or five-stars. I'll rate each character below based on how valuable they are in their best team comp, or based on the fact that they're very strong and versatile, slotting into most teams, such as Gilberta, Ardelia, and Akekuri. I'll also give …",

There was a moment where I thought Gryphline wouldn't release any freebies for players on launch—hell, despite having code redemption systems, some games straight-up refuse to hand out freebies on PC release (I'm looking at you, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance). Thankfully, though, we've got four whole codes to redeem this time, including a PC exclusive one. The valuable currency you'll get from these is Oroberyl, which will let you 'headhunt' operators, which is to say, pull for characters, though there are other items and currencies included, such as T-Creds. Below, I'll explain how to redeem Arknights: Endfield codes and unlock the code redemption system, plus I'll update the list whenever new codes drop, so you can quickly redeem your freebies for a little extra currency.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Last year I made a quiz all about recognizing a game logo from just a single letter —and yes, I did all 26 letters of the alphabet. While I was laboriously putting that quiz together I noticed something interesting: a lot of games use a very stylized letter A in their logo. There are several logos where the A has someone standing inside it, a few with eyes or a face, and some shaped like an element from the game itself. I guess it's just a just a pleasantly flexible letter that designers can have a little fun with. So, I put together another letter quiz, and this time it's all about the letter A. I'll show you an A from a game logo, you type in what you think the game's name is. Don't worry, there aren't 26 of them this time. Let me know how you did in the comments!",
