Jackson, the only daughter of Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe, has been open about her recovery journey and mental health struggles in recent years. “Getting sober ain’t always the indication that life is perfect,” Jackson wrote. “A few years in, it all got very, very hard for what felt like an eternity.” She continued, “I didn’t have the same survival skills I was used to having to cope. I had to learn to live life on life’s terms.” Jackson also addressed the mental health challenges she has faced during her sobriety, naming several conditions in her post. “Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder is a b&#8211;ch, so is PTSD and OCD,” she wrote. “If you’ve got this s&#8211;t or anything of the sort, you’re not alone.

It drops the ugly ribbon cable and forced soundbar of the original version using the Zero Connect Box to deliver an almost cable-free wall-mounted setup. With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung may finally upgrade the primary, ultrawide, and front camera sensors on the Galaxy S27 Ultra. The telephoto camera is expected to remain largely the same, though the periscope zoom could receive a wider aperture. These rumored changes follow years of criticism regarding Samsung’s minimal hardware evolution in its flagship imaging systems. Samsung’s flagships have undergone minimal hardware evolution over the years, particularly in the camera department. The upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to disappoint with the same camera hardware, and super early leaks for the Galaxy S27 Ultra also painted the same picture. However, a new leak suggests that Samsung might finally stop being so lazy and actually provide us with a camera upgrade in the Galaxy S27 Ultra. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This Android phone has an integrated physical keypad, along with enthusiast extras like a headphone jack and 3.5mm port. The Clicks Communicator has a recommended price of $499 and an early bird price of $399. The Clicks Keyboard was one of the more notable accessories released in recent years, attaching to your smartphone to give you a compact, if awkwardly oriented, physical keypad. Now, the company is back with a smartphone. Say hello to the Clicks Communicator. The Clicks Communicator is a full-fledged Android smartphone, featuring an integrated physical keypad and a nearly square 4.03-inch OLED screen (1,080 x 1,200 pixels). Clicks explains that the phone can be used as a standalone device, but added that it was also designed for people who use two phones. In fact, the company says it envisions the Communicator as a communication-focused device (surprise) while your other phone is focused on entertainment and content capture.",

It could be Motorola’s first book-style foldable phone. The device is said to feature big displays, AI features, and an advanced camera system, with more details expected to come later this year. Trusted leaker Evan Blass has shared what appear to be screenshots from an internal Lenovo presentation, and one of the slides reveals something big — a new device called the “Motorola Razr Fold.” If this leak is accurate, Motorola may be getting ready to compete directly with Samsung, Google, and others in the book-style foldable space instead of only selling flip-style Razr phones as it has for the past few years.",

It features “unlimited object recognition,” powered by a new AI foundation model (NarGPT) and dual RGB cameras. It also comes with specialized modes for households with babies. Narwal is using CES 2026 to show how far robot vacuum cleaners have come. The company has announced the Narwal Flow 2 Ultra, a successor to the Narwal Flow we reviewed last year . While the original Flow already impressed us with its precise navigation, self-cleaning base station, and more, the Flow 2 pushes innovation even further by doing something robot vacuums traditionally struggle with: understanding what they’re looking at, not just avoiding it.",

SwitchBot also revealed the Lock Vision series smart lock, the AI MindClip recorder, an E-Ink Weather Station, and the OBBOTO AI desk light.

The program gives developers early access to Even Hub, the software platform that powers Even Realities’ glasses, along with hands-on support from the company’s own software team. It’s just a small pilot scheme to start out, with a limited number of developers brought in to help shape how the platform evolves.",

XREAL also announced the XREAL Neo, a combination battery pack and video hub, to go with the XREAL 1S. XREAL is a big player in the burgeoning AR glasses space, and today, ahead of CES, the company’s announcing a “mid-generation refresh” for its XREAL One glasses from late 2024. The new XREAL 1S glasses improve on the older pair in a lot of little ways, all while shaving a few bucks off the previous model’s price tag. Like the XREAL One, the XREAL 1S glasses plug into anything with USB-C video output, showing that output on micro-OLED displays just behind the glasses’ lenses to create a sort of virtual display. Compared to the older model, the 1S comes with better resolution 1200p per eye (up from 1080p); a wider, 52-degree field of view; and brighter micro-OLED displays that are now 16:10 rather than 16:9.",

The page reveals that Privacy Display will be located in the Settings app, in the Display section. An animation showing how the feature works was also spotted on the page. Samsung has been developing a new feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra called Privacy Display. This feature is designed to dim or hide the display when viewing the screen at an angle, preventing strangers from taking unwanted peeks. Back in September 2025, we spotted code within an alleged build of One UI 8.5 that provided some details about the feature. The following month, more information was revealed when the potential UI for Privacy Display leaked . Another leak has now dropped, and it shows us how this function will work. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It has a larger 1.3-inch display with slimmer bezels, up to 14 days of battery life, two microphones, and step/sleep tracking. Pre-orders begin today for $199, with shipping starting in May. 2025 was a surprisingly big year for Pebble fans. Last March, former Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky unexpectedly launched two new Pebble smartwatches : the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

The phone adds Proton apps inside a locked-down Vault, while still allowing wider app access through a Wild Web section. Pricing starts at €699 with one year of service included, followed by a paid subscription for AphyOS features. Swiss phone maker Punkt is back at CES 2026 with a familiar message and a slightly more refined pitch. The company has unveiled the MC03, its latest privacy-focused smartphone, aimed at people who want more control over how their phone behaves and how much data it shares. All without completely abandoning modern apps and services. The MC03 builds on the idea behind the earlier MC02 , but Punkt says this new model is more clearly split into two areas. There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows. It’s a cleaner way of formalising something many privacy-conscious users already do manually by keeping safe apps separate from e…",

It’s a fair question. After all, the most transformative AI tools — from ChatGPT to NotebookLM — run in the cloud. There is currently a split between “visible AI” (the chatbots we communicate with) and “invisible AI” (the magical features many don’t realize use AI), but the heavy lifting is often done remotely. This split has contributed to AI fatigue, as users see high-end NPUs as expensive overkill for features that require an internet connection anyway.",

That same situation applies to smartphones and the chips powering them. Every year, we see companies like Qualcomm introduce their latest silicon, trying to wow us with performance metrics that make the previous generation’s chips look positively glacial in comparison.

The device will “likely” be built by Foxconn in either Vietnam or potentially the US, the tipster says. We first heard that Apple hardware design veteran Jony Ive was working with OpenAI to create some kind of AI-powered device more than a year ago, but we haven’t heard much about what that device will actually be. Today, a new report includes some key details about the project, which could be some kind of AI-integrated pen. According to a tweet from industry tipster Smart Pikachu , OpenAI’s forthcoming gadget will “likely” be produced by Foxconn, the contract manufacturer that assembles products like the iPhone and recent Pixel phone models. The tweet goes on to say that the initiative could take the shape of “a pen” and/or “a ‘to-go’ audio device.”",

Today, though, a new leak is giving us a good idea of what the phones’ finalized hardware will look like. According to a couple of posts by OnLeaks on Twitter , the Galaxy S26 series will look more than a little like the Galaxy S25 series.

The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers.

Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",

That might mean actively sitting down to watch for some people, or just letting it run in the background for others. But between ads and general visual clutter, the experience doesn’t always feel especially focused on the video itself. That’s what prompted Andy Walker to dig into the best ways to watch YouTube without ads and interruptions . He laid out a range of approaches that he has tried, from browsers and third-party apps to straight-up paying for YouTube Premium . Within that piece, Andy posed a poll question to you to see which of these options our readers actually rely on in real life and how divided opinions really are when it comes to tolerating YouTube as it is. The results are presented below and make for curious reading.",

These upgrades allow Bixby to access real-time information from the web and offer more relevant and detailed responses. The upgrade appears to be a part of the One UI 8.5 beta. Even after years of being outclassed by other rivals, Samsung refuses to give up on its smart assistant, Bixby . Now that all smart assistants are being upgraded with AI, Samsung has similar expectations for Bixby, too. But instead of developing a solution in-house, the tech giant is partnering with an OpenAI rival to execute complex commands given to Bixby, in a similar fashion to how Apple has integrated ChatGPT into Siri . Samsung has seemingly begun experimenting with Bixby powered by Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT rival that takes a research-first approach, accessing the web and blending other LLMs for responses. This integration was first mentioned last month by a leaker and now appears to be taking form. Based on a screenshot shared by user @achultra on X (via SammyGuru ), Bixby appears to be delivering some responses powered by Perplexity.",

If you prefer classic OnePlus design elements or are simply looking to save money, there are still plenty of older OnePlus devices worth considering, even as we head into 2026. Of course, not all older OnePlus phones are still worth your time. For example, you’re almost always better off with either a new mid-range Nord device over a used one.

Since Turbo is expected to be limited to China, the naming reinforces the likelihood that it will be rebranded as the Nord 6 for a global release.
