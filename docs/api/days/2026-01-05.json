Users can quickly switch between display modes through the NXTPAPER button, including a monochrome option. Other hardware details include a 50MP main camera, Dimensity 7300 SoC, and up to 512GB storage. Screens on modern phones have become so nice that it’s easy to take them for granted. But while we’ve got our pick of options with big, bright, high-refresh-rate panels, some manufacturers are trying a different approach. TCL has found success with its NXTPAPER tech , prioritizing eye comfort with matte-finish screens that offer a pleasant alternative to the shiny, glossy displays everyone else uses. And this week at CES 2026 , the company is showing off its latest NXTPAPER-based phone. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Today at CES, XREAL took the wraps off another new pair of glasses: the ROG XREAL R1, a gaming-oriented pair of AR glasses made in partnership with Asus. The R1’s gaming focus comes through mainly in its refresh rate. The micro-OLED displays under the ROG XREAL R1 clock in at a blistering 240Hz, and XREAL says that the glasses have a low latency of just three milliseconds.",

Pre-applied screen protectors are still the norm, and while they’ve gotten better, there will come a time when you need to replace them. Manufacturers want you to bring the phone back and have a professional do the job. But when the screen protector on my Galaxy Z Fold 4 gave up the ghost, I embraced my inner Jeremy Clarkson and asked: “How hard can it be?” The problem with foldable screen protectors",

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR Samsung may reportedly raise the prices of the Galaxy S26 series in its home market, South Korea. This hike comes as a result of the increasing prices of internal components, especially DRAM and NAND modules. The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series. So the next obvious step is to speculate on prices, but confusion prevails on that front as well.",

Samsung users in the US can already redeem a year’s worth of Perplexity Pro through the Galaxy Store. The company has also integrated Perplexity within Bixby on some of its smart home appliances. Samsung Galaxy phones are also expected to get a Perplexity-powered Bixby experience with One UI 8.5 , and the Galaxy S26 series could even come with pre-installed Perplexity .

It drops the ugly ribbon cable and forced soundbar of the original version using the Zero Connect Box to deliver an almost cable-free wall-mounted setup. With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

It could be Motorola’s first book-style foldable phone. The device is said to feature big displays, AI features, and an advanced camera system, with more details expected to come later this year. Trusted leaker Evan Blass has shared what appear to be screenshots from an internal Lenovo presentation, and one of the slides reveals something big — a new device called the “Motorola Razr Fold.” If this leak is accurate, Motorola may be getting ready to compete directly with Samsung, Google, and others in the book-style foldable space instead of only selling flip-style Razr phones as it has for the past few years.",

SwitchBot also revealed the Lock Vision series smart lock, the AI MindClip recorder, an E-Ink Weather Station, and the OBBOTO AI desk light. By conventional definition, smart home products excel at one task, and they do it expertly. However, there is also a need for more generalist products.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority Modern smartphone cameras are impressive beasts, as many camera phones combine cutting-edge hardware with advanced image processing capabilities. Some of the more notable innovations in recent years include periscope cameras, 200MP sensors, and all-pixel autofocus. However, one of my favorite hardware features arrived in 2022: one-inch camera sensors. Unfortunately, adoption of this tech has seemingly stalled in the last year or so, and it doesn’t look like we’ll see much of it in 2026. What went wrong?",

The models I’ve been testing deliver a genuinely enjoyable viewing experience even in lighting conditions that used to send me scrambling for blackout curtains. Built-in Google TV also strengthens the projector push. It helps turn what used to be an obnoxious setup process into something refreshingly TV-like, especially since features like autofocus and auto keystone correction handle fine-tuning.",

The page reveals that Privacy Display will be located in the Settings app, in the Display section. An animation showing how the feature works was also spotted on the page. Samsung has been developing a new feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra called Privacy Display. This feature is designed to dim or hide the display when viewing the screen at an angle, preventing strangers from taking unwanted peeks. Back in September 2025, we spotted code within an alleged build of One UI 8.5 that provided some details about the feature. The following month, more information was revealed when the potential UI for Privacy Display leaked . Another leak has now dropped, and it shows us how this function will work.

Pre-orders begin today for $199, with shipping starting in May. 2025 was a surprisingly big year for Pebble fans. Last March, former Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky unexpectedly launched two new Pebble smartwatches : the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

Most of these headlines were expected, such as Samsung’s conservative Galaxy S25 series and the well-received Pixel 9a . However, 2025 also saw more than its fair share of headlines that were simply hard to believe. So with that in mind, we’re taking a look at some of the most unbelievable stories of the year.",

The phone adds Proton apps inside a locked-down Vault, while still allowing wider app access through a Wild Web section. Pricing starts at €699 with one year of service included, followed by a paid subscription for AphyOS features. Swiss phone maker Punkt is back at CES 2026 with a familiar message and a slightly more refined pitch. The company has unveiled the MC03, its latest privacy-focused smartphone, aimed at people who want more control over how their phone behaves and how much data it shares. All without completely abandoning modern apps and services. The MC03 builds on the idea behind the earlier MC02 , but Punkt says this new model is more clearly split into two areas. There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows. It’s a cleaner way of formalising something many privacy-conscious users already do manually by keeping safe apps separate from e…",

The Freestyle+ sticks with the same compact, self-contained design as previous models, complete with a cylindrical body and 180-degree rotating stand. The flexible setup still allows the projector to throw an image onto walls, floors, or ceilings, and it’s still easy to move from room to room without much effort.",

After pushing back its deadline for installing the Bluetooth firmware twice, today is looking like the last official day you’ll be able to use Google’s flashing tool. Even after Google takes its tool offline, third-party efforts have preserved the Bluetooth firmware and allow you to host the flashing tool yourself. Cloud-based gaming is bigger than ever right now, whether you’re using services like Xbox Game Pass or just streaming games on your Switch . But despite this clearly being a viable business model, Google just couldn’t figure out how to make it work, and now we’re quickly coming up on the three-year anniversary of the company shutting down Stadia . While that was a very public failure for Google, the company still tried to make the best of the situation by giving Stadia hardware a new lease on life — and if you haven’t taken advantage of that yet, there’s an important deadline we’re running up against.

The Galaxy S26 series will have camera bumps that look quite a bit like the ones on Galaxy Z Fold phones. The new year is right around the corner, and that means we’re coming up on Galaxy Unpacked. The event is expected to take place a little later this time, with the Galaxy S26 reveal reportedly pushed back a few weeks. Today, though, a new leak is giving us a good idea of what the phones’ finalized hardware will look like. According to a couple of posts by OnLeaks on Twitter , the Galaxy S26 series will look more than a little like the Galaxy S25 series. One notable difference, though, is that the forthcoming phones’ camera bumps will look like the ones on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones, with three individual camera lenses enclosed in a pill-shaped camera bump.",

    "body": "TL;DR The Samsung Galaxy A17 5G and Galaxy Tab A11+ both arrive in early January. The previous Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone of Q3 2025. The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers. We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",

Rather than competing head-on with minimalist E-Ink tablets or fully fledged tablets, it’s designed to be faster and more flexible than E-Ink, but still easier on the eyes than a typical LCD slate.
