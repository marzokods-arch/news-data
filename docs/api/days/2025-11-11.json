Exoskeleton maker Dnsys is the partner in this enterprise and worked with Kojima Productions art director Yoji Shinkawa on the design. The exoskeleton is based on an existing Dnsys model but altered to fit the Death Stranding aesthetic, with things like lights that show the battery level dotted on the frame. \"We designed this exoskeleton with the same passion and precision as if it were built for the world of Death Stranding,\" says Shinkawa . \"Every detail was refined to bring the game’s futuristic vision into reality, creating something Sam himself might wear. Wearing it feels as if the world of Death Stranding has come to life, where imagination and reality finally connect.\" Then we get to the claims of what this thing does.

And not everyone was convinced a story-driven open world was going to work. \"That was the biggest challenge back then,\" Adam Badowski, CD Projekt's joint CEO, tells us. \"Because you know, right now, it's pretty obvious for us that we can combine storytelling and a cinematic experience with the open world, but back then, it was huge. I mean, for us, for the industry. And for some people, they really didn't believe it was possible.\" The studio had already shown everyone it could craft an RPG with a strong story, but The Witcher 3 was aiming for something more. \"Our offer was different,\" says Badowski. \"We will create something big, in the open world, but with solid and very cinematic storytelling.

If only I'd fallen into literally any of the massive bodies of water available, I would have survived. And it would have all been thanks to CD Projekt's joint CEO Adam Badowski. \"I remember the moment when I asked a very difficult question [that felt] obvious to me,\" explains Badowski, \"there's water, [but] where's swimming? The whole room was quiet.\" The team's main concern was that \"they thought we'd need to cut something, so we didn't need to have swimming\". Thankfully this wasn't the case. (Image credit: CDPR) Swimming is often quite a contentious mechanic , you either loathe it or deal with it, and I personally think it's only truly enjoyable when it's a game's sole focus like in Abzu.

    "body": "From vital crafting materials to random item quests, you need to grab a whole bunch of odds and ends in Arc Raiders . So much that it's often overwhelming and confusing, leading you to lug back a rucksack full of junk, hoping that at least something in it will come in handy. Simply put, I got fed up and decided to get to the root of the issue; I jotted down all 62 unique items I needed to find for quests, Scrappy and workshop upgrades, and the Expedition Project , which adds up to a staggering 1,195 materials you need to haul back to Speranza. Here's hoping my math skills haven't let me down. Nevertheless, in tallying this all up, I noticed a few interesting things. Firstly, you need to loot the drivers of every single Arc robot in the game right now besides a Queen. As you'd imagine, you generally need more of the basic Arcs' parts compared to the tougher ones, though you need six Bastion and Bombardier Cells, six Surveyor Vaults, and eight Leaper Pulse Units. I think it's safe to say we all hate fighting Leapers , and Surveyor drones are so skittish that they're hard to actually put down. So, if you get any of these items before their relevant upgrade task, hang on to them, or y…",

    "body": "Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida reckons that increasing confidence among Korean game developers is at least partly in thanks to Stellar Blade. Shift Up's soulslite did pretty well for itself when it hit consoles last year, with a further boost when the game made its way over to PC in early 2025. I had a good amount of fun with Stellar Blade myself— even if I found it a little uninspired in the face of similar concepts. But when it comes to Korean developers breaking out beyond niche MMOs and mobile games, I can't deny that Stellar Blade is one of the forerunners in broadening the region's reach. (Image credit: M Bowles via Getty Images) It's something that Yoshida agrees with, and even reckons that the game's success has bolstered spirits among Korean game developers, particularly when it comes to developing console games. As spotted by GamesRadar (via MiniMap ), the ex-PlayStation boss sat down with press ahead of game development conference G-Star to chat about the Korean indie scene, the role larger corporations play in helping them to thrive, and other console-y related bits. When asked about how the collaboration with Stellar Blade came about, Yoshida said: \"I visited …",

How do you measure that? Well, you take into account \"the frequency of a given patent being cited as a basis for the rejection of another company's patent\"—if one company's patent carries more weight, similar ideas are more likely to be rejected. While Bandai Namco was in the top three last year, it has moved up past mobile game developer Gree and taken SIE's crown, leading the way with 245 patents and a score of 8,565.2—which is a significant lead. Here are the patent scores for the top three: Bandai: 8,565.2 Sony Interactive Entertainment: 6,631.0 Gree: 5,121.9 The list is dominated by several familiar giants of the industry, such as Sega, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company.

At the time of writing, Fallout 4—Creations Bundle sat at a \"Mostly Negative\" Steam rating with 124 reviews—quite a lot for what is essentially an asset pack. While some of the reviews complain about the price and the pack's content—which is apparently a repackaging of items that were already available on the Creations Store—the bulk of the complaints lament that the pack doesn't actually work. \"Game absolutely refuses to let you attempt to install anything involving the Creation Club and freezes upon launching and quitting the game to the point where you can't even use Task Manager or Steam to force close,\" writes Steam user HemlokGaming .

The only problem is that everyone else in the game also has access to them, so you have to get ahead of the loot locusts by discovering some more obscure locations full of great resources. One of my favourite spots is in the Raider Outposts in Dam Battlegrounds. There'll usually be great loot in there as is, some blankets or medical supplies, alongside crafting materials and sometimes a gun case just sitting on the ground floor of the Outpost. Then there's a ladder outside leading to the roof, where there'll occasionally be some crates to break into. But the best place in the Raider Outposts to loot is actually in the ceiling.

Yup, this 27-inch, 1440p gaming monitor packs the very latest 4th gen Samsung QD-OLED panel technology. A new generation of OLED panel is always exciting, but how much of an upgrade is it over the best currently available OLED monitors ? Does it fix OLED's full-screen brightness limitations? What about QD-OLED's specific problems with ambient light and font rendering? What does a 500 Hz OLED actually look like set to full reheat? Hold those thoughts while we cover off this new display's various speeds and feeds. Along with the lofty 500 Hz refresh and 2,560 by 1,440 native resolution, you get OLED's characteristic uber-low response times, which come in at a claimed 0.03 ms. No question, this thing is built for speed. It's also engineered to be brighter than previous displays that rely on Samsung's QD-OLED technology. Right at the beginning of the year at the CES show, Samsung unveiled the next step in its QD-OLED roadmap . It's taken a little while for that to show up in PC monitors as opposed to TVs, but it's finally landed at PCG towers. MSI MPG 271QR X50 spec…",

While there are arguably more ergonomic options on the market, or simply ones with more gaming features, the Freestyle Edge is a near-perfect blend of comfort, performance, and price tag. Well, it's back again, this time in the form of a small update: the Freestyle Edge RGB Plus . When I say small, I really do mean small, because Kinesis Gaming has only changed a handful of aspects of the original package. First up are the key switches, which have been swapped from Cherry MX to Gateron Pro v1. This was probably done for cost reasons, but the good news here is that whatever money Kinesis has saved by using different mechanical switches, it's spent it on the lift kit (which tents the keyboard) and Apple Mac modifier keycaps. These used to be optional extras (and quite pricey, too), but now they're included in the box.

Arc Raiders is an intentionally hefty shooter that rewards positioning and stealth over lightning-quick reflexes, but players are still finding techniques that speed you up or assist a daring escape. If you want to add a little spice to your raids, you can and should learn the ways of the ledge grab . By holding spacebar as you fall, your raider will catch any nearby ledge and hoist up. The timing is generous, and it doesn't seem to matter how far or fast you're falling before you grab the ledge. With a little practice, and an eye for what is and isn't a valid ledge, you can confidently start jumping off somewhat large gaps without worrying about fall damage. String a few grabs together and you can even quickly descend a tall building . The tricky part is that chaining grabs together requires letting go of a grab before you climb the ledge. Of course, you can also take it to extremes by leaping off a cliff, crossing your fingers, and aiming for something to grab—like in this clip below, where a street light turns into a quick-descent elevator. There's so much sick movement tech in this game! The po…",

Something I didn't get too deeply into when I gushed about Tavern Keeper last week is its item design tool. There are all sorts of objects to build in your tavern, from useful furniture like tables, chairs, and beds to decorative items like bookcases, paintings, and rugs—but that's just the start. Tavern Keeper also invites players to modify existing items or create their own with its in-game design tool and share them with other players. I've only done some basic modifications so far, like decorating countertops with items like gold coins, goblets, playing cards, and perhaps a dagger half-buried in the wood of a table. Typically fantasy set dressing. But the item design tool in Tavern Keeper is so flexible that players have been creating some shockingly imagin…",

    "body": "The most notable thing about this year's list of PC Gamer's highest review scores is what doesn't appear on it. Many of the games that are in the running for one of our Game of the Year awards aren't represented, including Elden Ring Nightreign, Battlefield 6, Europa Universalis 5, Arc Raiders, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Those games all received favorable scores by our standards, just not quite favorable enough to pass the bar I've set here, which is 89%-and-up. Clair Obscur received what was probably our most controversial score of the year at 70% —still a recommendation for the French RPG, though not the shining praise it got elsewhere. (Including from some of PCG's other writers.) Reviews aren't a measure of popularity or an attempt to arrive at the average opinion, so I don't consider these notable absences a bug. There's a lot to appreciate about the two most-played new games right now, Battlefield 6 ( 82% ) and Arc Raiders ( 86% ), but to get a really high score, a game has to inspire an individual reviewer to go out on a limb and champion it, perhaps even pushing back on editors whose responsibility it is to ask, \"OK, but is it actually a 92%?\" As 2025 draws to a clos…",

That also means that the current season, or league, will be ending in a few weeks and everyone's characters will be sent to live on the standard version of the game before the new update hits. It's a short post for what will likely be a big patch.

Another expert noted that its tone resembled \"a high-school drama club's Elizabethan improv night.\" That sounds pretty bad. As a result, Silksong's Steam rating briefly fell to \"mostly negative\", and ever since a fan group called Team Cart Fix has been working away in the background to improve the Chinese translation. The fruits of their labour have been available as an unofficial mod for a while, but now, in Silksong's new Patch 4, the work of Team Cart Fix has been officially implemented in the game. \"Their translation builds from elements of the original Silksong translation, retaining existing names for most characters and places, except in instances where the original translation was incorrect, or inconsistent with Hollow Knight,\" Team Cherry writes . \"Most importantly, this is a translation by fans who are well-v…",

Blizzard released a roadmap at the start of the year and pretty much everything on it has come and gone. A few things have shifted around—like leaderboards coming earlier than expected next season—but the new expansion for 2026 still hasn't been announced. In a recent interview with Diablo 4 streamer Rob2628 , the developers gave a pretty clear hint on when the expansion news will finally arrive. Rob brought up an image recently datamined from the game that reads December 12 in Chinese, which happens to be the same day (taking time zones in account) as this year's The Game Awards show. He asked associate game director Zaven Haroutunian and lead live game designer Colin Finer if Diablo fans should watch it. Haroutunian, leaning close to his webcam and smiling, replied, \"Everyone should be watching it. We're all gamers, we're gonna watch it.\" I think that's about as close to an official tease as you're going to…",

As promised by DICE lead producer David Sirland last week, the quality-of-life update will address the gun dispersion issues, incorrect vehicle spawns, the unstoppable lock-on missile , and most notably, the \"drone hammer\" bug that let players levitate on command. That last bug fix could be a particularly big ideal, as folks were using the levitation exploit to get high up on maps that have no air vehicles and land on out-of-bounds rooftops on Siege of Cairo. This is also the first major update for Redsec, Battlefield 6's free-to-play battle royale mode. That knocks a few big problems off the to-do list, though to be honest, my biggest gripes with Battlefield 6 are problems that will take a lot longer to address: the lack of big maps and the terrible UI. Sirland acknowledged both topics in his AMA last week, but gave no timeline or indicated they were huge priorities. The good news is we're getting one new big map next week: Eastwood .

Still, Arabella's patter with Withers is a charming, unexpected bit of writing that punches above its weight in shading more depth into both characters: Withers clearly has a soft spot for children, and Arabella has no problem chopping it up with an immortal watcher. Seeing more of that relationship is certainly welcome. After finding Arabella's dead parents but before telling her about their fate, she was supposed to have a brief back-and-forth with Withers at the party camp where she tweaks his nose and settles on the Bone Man nickname. \"I am not a 'skellie,' thou shalt call me Withers,\" the reluctant avatar of cosmic judgement peevishly intones. \"'Withers?'

According to the press release, you’ll be able to beat the blues by customising your pixel-art cafe across multiple rooms with \"hundreds of customisation items\", brew a variety of coffees, and create latte art.

One of the main things Bethesda learned is that cinematic, Mass Effect-style dialogue systems are a bad fit for Bethesda games. In an interview with GQ , Howard was asked what he thought the best game he'd worked on is. Responding diplomatically, Howard pointed to several features of multiple games, while also mentioning that some things \"didn't resonate\" with players. After a bit of coaxing, Howard revealed that Fallout 4's dialogue system was one of them. \"We spent forever on the dialogue system in Fallout 4,\" Howard said. \"'How do we do an interactive conversation in an interesting way?

But more likely than not, all you want to know is what's going on with The Elder Scrolls 6. Well, great news: in a recent chat with GQ , Bethesda big boss Todd Howard said that \"The Elder Scrolls 6 is the everyday thing\" that its devs are working on right now. Howard says likes to have a \"break\" between Elder Scrolls games—to avoid them becoming rote and predictable—but admits that while \"It’s also good for an audience to have a break—The Elder Scrolls has been too long.\" Boy, has it—it has been, for those not keeping track, a full 14 years since Skyrim first released, which was itself a mere five years after Oblivion. Howard says he recently oversaw a \"three-hour play test of The Elder Scrolls 6\" for fans who raised money for the Make-A-Wish foundation to get a character made (that'd be the UESP editors who recently visited Bethesda to create a memorial character for community member Loranna…",

As obvious as it sounds, it's worth pointing out that you get these Firing Cores from Arc Sentinels, which are sniper turrets attached to ceilings in just a few specific locations, and are different to the regular turrets you commonly encounter. You're less likely to run into these naturally compared to almost all other Arc types. With that in mind, tracking them down for their cores proves to be a time-consuming task.

The leak first appeared on X, where user Amethxst posted an image purportedly showing new, hidden symbols that have been added to the PlayStation store. One icon reads \"Cross-Buy\", while the second reads PS5/PC. \"New Symbols will be added soon (website & tool), but here [are] some nice new features from PlayStation\", Amethxst wrote. \"A kind of 'echo mode' 'PS5/PC games' and 'Cross-Buy'.\" While this initial post was difficult to verify, later, Amethxst followed this up with a video , in which they locate the symbols within the PS5's user menu, and it is much more convincing. Elsewhere, a French website Dealabs (via Gamespot ) provided further evidence of the symbols' authenticity, discovering the words \"crossbuy-tag\" within some CSS files on the PlayStation Store. Since the term \"Cross-Buy\" has been used by Sony since the PS-Vita days, Dealabs also checked when the new symbols were added to the store, and discovered they first appeared in June this year. Sony has yet to confirm the authenticity of these symbols. But PC/PS5 cross-buy would certainly fall i…",
