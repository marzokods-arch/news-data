At that time his character Tywin Lannister was a fan favourite for viewers of Game of Thrones, and hadn't yet been unceremoniously killed off while on the privy. Life was good. The announcement contained a quote from Marcin Blacha, lead writer on The Witcher 3, expressing that it was a \"dream come true for the team here at Red to be able to work with such an accomplished actor and magnetic personality.\" But according to CD Projekt's English adaptation director, Borys Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz, getting Dance on board was akin to diffusing a ticking time bomb. In a new interview with PC Gamer, Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz explained that they \"didn't really have a strong notion that Emhyr should be a AAA talent. But there was a point during the development and promotion process when we put a countdown up on our website [...] saying that some important announcement was pending [...] and then we decided not to mak…",

We want to establish ourselves as the new kings of RPGs.\" As for how Warhorse intends to achieve this, Stolz-Zwilling believes the studio is already on the right track, in the way KCD 2 blends detailed quest design with a reactive, open-ended world that recalls the emergent delights of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion . This, Stolz-Zwilling says, will carry through into whatever Warhorse makes next: \"We believe that we have our own formula here, and that we define them in a specific way, and our next project will go the same direction.

Once I was done, I was shocked to see Creative hog up half of the spots we've designated for different price points and use cases. It turns out that, despite competition from Blueant, Razer, OXS, and Majority, Creative is on a bit of a hot streak of late. Starting from the top, the Creative Pebble Pro is now our choice for the best budget PC speakers. For $70, this is a super capable set of speakers that have solid sound reproduction and come in a tiny little shell. If you have limited space, the Pro is a great choice, though the bass is a little lacking, and the Bluetooth is a pretty basic as it only supports the SBC codec. No lossless for you (at least wirelessly). If you aren't in the market for a budget set of speakers, the Creative Stage Pro has been named the best gaming soundbar , and for good reason. This soundbar plus subwoofer package absolutely thumps, with sound that might just wake your neighbors if you aren't careful. It's not just loud, though; it sounds great, has excellent connectivity and still comes …",

It's set in a walled corporate city in the aftermath of a mysterious cataclysm. Teen protagonist Luca loses her legs during the calamity and is left for dead, but fortunately it's not long before she's possessed by a demon called Rhem, who grants her some new insectile legs on the proviso they collaborate on an escape from the ruined city. As far as pacts with the devil go, it's pretty rational. The 20-odd hour metroidvania that ensues has a lot to admire about it, but doesn't buck nor create any trends. Before the fall, the corporate doyens of this walled city, Agradyne, siphoned a resource called Chroma from captured demons, which was used to power the batteries they sold.

Yet Phison's CEO Khein-Seng Pua says that in \"only three months\", NAND prices have doubled (via Digitimes ). What gives? Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, that's the cost of NAND, not the cost of an SSD. Phison buys NAND (flash) chips from suppliers—the three big ones being Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron—and then uses them to make their own enterprise SSDs or to make SSDs for other customers. So, if the TLC flash that Phison is buying has risen from about $4.80 for one Tb (128 GB) in July to $10.70, as Pua claims, NAND has doubled in price, but this has yet to ripple into the SSD market. It will, though; that's unavoidable. SSD makers like Phison aren't going to shoulder 2x costs just 'cause. Eventually, SSD prices will have to rise. The primary cause for the rise in NAND prices is almost certainly undersupply caused by high demand for AI servers , which has now knocked on to SSD manufacturers like Phison. The …",

Aerie was a formerly-winged elf who worked in a circus and had a great deal of personal trauma, which she worked out over the course of an extended courtship with you, the male player character. At some point, she would get pregnant, and the resulting child—named, in the blunt language of early CRPGs, \" Aerie's Baby \"—would hold eternal tenure in your already-limited inventory, in a space you might otherwise put a bundle of arrows or a longsword. This is a sequence of events which I now regard as having ruined all of videogames. (Image credit: BioWare) To be fair to poor, pinioned Aerie, she was not the only option in the game's ragbag of sweethearts, but she is the one that sticks in my memory, mostly because of the storage baby. But the shape of BG2's romances is the shape of so many RPG romances since. Swap out Aerie for Liara, Viconia for Lae'zel, Anomen for Alistair—decades later and we're still wooing the same hotties by different names. It does not work for me.

The perceived level of complexity that you're getting into can be challenging to overcome, but over the last decade more and more games in this vein have transformed from niche outliers to something more accessible. Baldur's Gate 3 remains one of the biggest RPG surprises of recent years. The franchise rose from a twenty year slumber, and through the power of nuanced storytelling emerged from the CRPG weeds as the undisputed champion of the genre—and, in some ways, of all genres . But prior to that, at the time of The Witcher 3 's release, the natural comparison was, of course, Skyrim, which had recently redefined the open world RPG—full of experimentation, freedom, and floating cheese. Skyrim may have had some decidedly dark elements, but The Witcher 3 leaned into it hard—a potentially risky move at the time.

The bad news is that Sedletz Monastery has gone into lockdown, its monks into seclusion, and the abbot has ordered you to stay put in the infirmary, and absolutely not go sneaking about investigating the source of the plague. But sneaking about you will go if you want to grab the necessary materials for the plague mask, so make sure to avoid guards and save often. If one does spot you, either try to sprint into a safe, non-private area, or simply ask them to take you back to the infirmary by replying.

The good news is that there's a very lucrative route through Buried City that'll often give you two, three, or sometimes even more rusted gears per run. The bad news is that it's not exactly quick, what with all the breaching you'll have to do. Below, I'll go over the route and specifically where to loot to stock up on rusted parts. And once you've got what you need, you'll be right next to a metro to extract. Where to find rusted gears in Arc Raiders (Image credit: Embark) You'll find rusted gears inside cars and generators , which are pretty common across all the maps. With that in mind, the best place to get rusted gears is to loot Warehouse, Marano Station, and Parking Garage in the northwest of Buried City.

Most notably, none of the decisions you make in the Witcher 3 are as momentous as the game-changing choice at the heart The Witcher 2, where choosing to help one of two characters in a fight led to a second act viewed from completely different perspectives. Roughly 90% of The Witcher 2's second-act strands are unique, each with its own locations, key characters, and quests. I've always wondered if CD Projekt will commit so wholly to an in-game decision again. But according to CD Projekt's co-CEO Adam Badowski, such an eventuality is unlikely. Speaking to PC Gamer, Badowski discussed the changes CD Projekt made between The Witcher 2 and 3, noting that the biggest of these was structural. \"In The Witcher 2, we had a very difficult structure of the game, because there are two paths. You can go one path and you won't see the other path,\" he says. \"From the production perspective it's a waste of resources. From [the] player's perspective, it…",

But when it comes to Korean developers breaking out beyond niche MMOs and mobile games, I can't deny that Stellar Blade is one of the forerunners in broadening the region's reach.

As spotted by GamesRadar (via MiniMap ), the ex-PlayStation boss sat down with press ahead of game development conference G-Star to chat about the Korean indie scene, the role larger corporations play in helping them to thrive, and other console-y related bits.

Patent Result values a company's quality over quantity and the strength of the ideas being brought to the table, so the ranking is based on both \"the quantity and relevance of their patents\". How do you measure that? Well, you take into account \"the frequency of a given patent being cited as a basis for the rejection of another company's patent\"—if one company's patent carries more weight, similar ideas are more likely to be rejected. While Bandai Namco was in the top three last year, it has moved up past mobile game developer Gree and taken SIE's crown, leading the way with 245 patents and a score of 8,565.2—which is a significant lead. Here are the patent scores for the top three: Bandai: 8,565.2 Sony Interactive Entertainment: 6,631.0 Gree: 5,121.9 The list is dominated by several familiar giants of the industry, such as Sega, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company.

At the time of writing, Fallout 4—Creations Bundle sat at a \"Mostly Negative\" Steam rating with 124 reviews—quite a lot for what is essentially an asset pack. While some of the reviews complain about the price and the pack's content—which is apparently a repackaging of items that were already available on the Creations Store—the bulk of the complaints lament that the pack doesn't actually work. \"Game absolutely refuses to let you attempt to install anything involving the Creation Club and freezes upon launching and quitting the game to the point where you can't even use Task Manager or Steam to force close,\" writes Steam user HemlokGaming .

One of my favourite spots is in the Raider Outposts in Dam Battlegrounds. There'll usually be great loot in there as is, some blankets or medical supplies, alongside crafting materials and sometimes a gun case just sitting on the ground floor of the Outpost.

In the Netflix promo material showing Elordi transforming into 'The Creature' for the role, we can see him busting out a Steam Deck to pass the time on, in addition to checking his phone and reading. Apparently, the transformation into Frankie's creature took 10 hours , so bringing a Deck to the makeup/SFX seat was certainly prudent.

Yup, this 27-inch, 1440p gaming monitor packs the very latest 4th gen Samsung QD-OLED panel technology. A new generation of OLED panel is always exciting, but how much of an upgrade is it over the best currently available OLED monitors ? Does it fix OLED's full-screen brightness limitations? What about QD-OLED's specific problems with ambient light and font rendering? What does a 500 Hz OLED actually look like set to full reheat? Hold those thoughts while we cover off this new display's various speeds and feeds. Along with the lofty 500 Hz refresh and 2,560 by 1,440 native resolution, you get OLED's characteristic uber-low response times, which come in at a claimed 0.03 ms. No question, this thing is built for speed. It's also engineered to be brighter than previous displays that rely on Samsung's QD-OLED technology. Right at the beginning of the year at the CES show, Samsung unveiled the next step in its QD-OLED roadmap .

Well, it's back again, this time in the form of a small update: the Freestyle Edge RGB Plus . When I say small, I really do mean small, because Kinesis Gaming has only changed a handful of aspects of the original package. First up are the key switches, which have been swapped from Cherry MX to Gateron Pro v1. This was probably done for cost reasons, but the good news here is that whatever money Kinesis has saved by using different mechanical switches, it's spent it on the lift kit (which tents the keyboard) and Apple Mac modifier keycaps. These used to be optional extras (and quite pricey, too), but now they're included in the box.

Arc Raiders is an intentionally hefty shooter that rewards positioning and stealth over lightning-quick reflexes, but players are still finding techniques that speed you up or assist a daring escape. If you want to add a little spice to your raids, you can and should learn the ways of the ledge grab . By holding spacebar as you fall, your raider will catch any nearby ledge and hoist up. The timing is generous, and it doesn't seem to matter how far or fast you're falling before you grab the ledge. With a little practice, and an eye for what is and isn't a valid ledge, you can confidently start jumping off somewhat large gaps without worrying about fall damage. String a few grabs together and you can even quickly descend a tall building . The tricky part is that chaining grabs together requires letting go of a grab before you climb the ledge. Of course, you can also take it to extremes by leaping off a cliff, crossing your fingers, and aiming for something to grab—like in this clip below, where a street light turns into a quick-descent elevator. There's so much sick movement tech in this game! The po…",

Something I didn't get too deeply into when I gushed about Tavern Keeper last week is its item design tool. There are all sorts of objects to build in your tavern, from useful furniture like tables, chairs, and beds to decorative items like bookcases, paintings, and rugs—but that's just the start. Tavern Keeper also invites players to modify existing items or create their own with its in-game design tool and share them with other players. I've only done some basic modifications so far, like decorating countertops with items like gold coins, goblets, playing cards, and perhaps a dagger half-buried in the wood of a table. Typically fantasy set dressing. But the item design tool in Tavern Keeper is so flexible that players have been creating some shockingly imagin…",

    "body": "The most notable thing about this year's list of PC Gamer's highest review scores is what doesn't appear on it. Many of the games that are in the running for one of our Game of the Year awards aren't represented, including Elden Ring Nightreign, Battlefield 6, Europa Universalis 5, Arc Raiders, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Those games all received favorable scores by our standards, just not quite favorable enough to pass the bar I've set here, which is 89%-and-up. Clair Obscur received what was probably our most controversial score of the year at 70% —still a recommendation for the French RPG, though not the shining praise it got elsewhere. (Including from some of PCG's other writers.) Reviews aren't a measure of popularity or an attempt to arrive at the average opinion, so I don't consider these notable absences a bug. There's a lot to appreciate about the two most-played new games right now, Battlefield 6 ( 82% ) and Arc Raiders ( 86% ), but to get a really high score, a game has to inspire an individual reviewer to go out on a limb and champion it, perhaps even pushing back on editors whose responsibility it is to ask, \"OK, but is it actually a 92%?\" As 2025 draws to a clos…",

It's a short post for what will likely be a big patch. Creative director Mark Roberts told PC Gamer in a recent interview that the developer wasn't expecting to rework the endgame experience, which is one of the reasons Path of Exile 2 won't have a full release this year. The first step in that rework already happened in a recent patch , but the bulk of the changes are still yet to come. The g…",

Another expert noted that its tone resembled \"a high-school drama club's Elizabethan improv night.\" That sounds pretty bad. As a result, Silksong's Steam rating briefly fell to \"mostly negative\", and ever since a fan group called Team Cart Fix has been working away in the background to improve the Chinese translation. The fruits of their labour have been available as an unofficial mod for a while, but now, in Silksong's new Patch 4, the work of Team Cart Fix has been officially implemented in the game. \"Their translation builds from elements of the original Silksong translation, retaining existing names for most characters and places, except in instances where the original translation was incorrect, or inconsistent with Hollow Knight,\" Team Cherry writes . \"Most importantly, this is a translation by fans who are well-v…",

A few things have shifted around—like leaderboards coming earlier than expected next season—but the new expansion for 2026 still hasn't been announced. In a recent interview with Diablo 4 streamer Rob2628 , the developers gave a pretty clear hint on when the expansion news will finally arrive. Rob brought up an image recently datamined from the game that reads December 12 in Chinese, which happens to be the same day (taking time zones in account) as this year's The Game Awards show. He asked associate game director Zaven Haroutunian and lead live game designer Colin Finer if Diablo fans should watch it. Haroutunian, leaning close to his webcam and smiling, replied, \"Everyone should be watching it. We're all gamers, we're gonna watch it.\" I think that's about as close to an official tease as you're going to…",

    "body": "The next Battlefield 6 patch is squarely aimed at its most annoying bugs. As promised by DICE lead producer David Sirland last week, the quality-of-life update will address the gun dispersion issues, incorrect vehicle spawns, the unstoppable lock-on missile , and most notably, the \"drone hammer\" bug that let players levitate on command. That last bug fix could be a particularly big ideal, as folks were using the levitation exploit to get high up on maps that have no air vehicles and land on out-of-bounds rooftops on Siege of Cairo. This is also the first major update for Redsec, Battlefield 6's free-to-play battle royale mode. That knocks a few big problems off the to-do list, though to be honest, my biggest gripes with Battlefield 6 are problems that will take a lot longer to address: the lack of big maps and the terrible UI. Sirland acknowledged both topics in his AMA last week, but gave no timeline or indicated they were huge priorities. The good news is we're getting one new big map next week: Eastwood . Update 1.1.1.5 arrives on November 11 at 9 AM UTC. Here are the full patch notes: PLAYER Fixed an issue where dispersion would be higher than intended when going from sprint t…",
