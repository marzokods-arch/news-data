Back then, if you wanted a world—a real world—there was only one place to go: Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs).

Along with a fix for the Depth level increase bug, this patch will also give you an option to voluntarily decrease your Depth level and add Depth level demotion protection for level three onward.

While I can't exactly say I've missed walking sims—there's been no shortage of other games to keep me occupied in the meantime—I certainly wouldn't mind a luscious, whimsical first-person narrative adventure to saunter around for a few hours. Fortunately, after years wandering through the wilderness, the walking sim has decided to pay us a visit. And it's all thanks to Arctic Awakening , a new and exceedingly pretty sci-fi narrative thriller developed by GoldFire Studios. Set in the near-future, Arctic Awakening sees you play as Kai, a bush pilot en-route on a supply run to a remote Alaskan town when his plane is downed by a sudden, violent storm. Dragging himself from the wreckage, Kai embarks upon a mission to find his missing copilot Donovan, braving harsh weather and exploring weird sci-fi structures in the process. Kai is accompanied on his adventure …",

The series, created by animator Krinkels, was a sort-of cultural after-dinner mint for fans of The Matrix. Madness' fast-paced, hyper-violent shorts involve grey, cross-faced people blasting each other to smithereens. Central to the series' appeal was how its action scenes grew more impressive and elaborate with every passing episode, and it was always fun to see how far Krinkels could push things when a new entry dropped. I haven't thought about Madness for a long time (though the series hasn't gone away, as I'll get to shortly). But those memories came flooding back when I spied Somewhere in Hell , a Doom 2 mod that goes to impressive lengths to recreate Madness' flashy, bloody action in id Software's shooter sequel. Somewhere in Hell basically replaces Doom's weapons and enemies with goons and firearms from Krinkels' animations. But what's impressive is how modder Recurracy 2 has infused the mod with the speed and vicious lethality of Krinkels' animations. The legions of monochromatic foes you face move across the …",

It is with open arms, therefore, that I welcome The Lift , a \"supernatural handyman simulator\" that takes the core premise of House Flipper but switches out its crumbling bungalows and mouldy condos for a massive, Soviet-core scientific facility. It's basically Abiotic Factor for DIY sickos, and I am already buckling up my neglected toolbelt in anticipation.

For those unfamiliar with the art of medieval beermaking, Ale Abbey tasks players with founding a monastery in a boozy slice of Middle-Ages Europe, transforming it into the finest monkish brewery in Christendom. Your Fermentine order is founded on familiar management-sim mechanics, like building new rooms for your monastery, recruiting new brothers and sisters, and maintaining their general health and happiness. But Ale Abbey adds its own citrusy twist to this formula in the form of an elaborate brewing system. Instead of making pre-set beers, you create your own beverage through choosing a style of ale, picking what equipment you'll use to brew it, and adjusting variables like the quality and quantity of your grain, the temperature of your mash, and how long you choose to age it once barrelled.

I will, however, show you this freakishly adorable baby Seikret minion revealed with the collab rewards and walk away. Whatever happens after is not my business. The baby Seikret (along with a Vigorwasp minion) is headed to the MMORPG in October when FF14 kicks off its collaboration with Monster Hunter Wilds. I know some of you are disappointed it's not a Palico, and I get it; they're cute. But we already got one when Rathalos landed in Stormblood's crossover with Monster Hunter: World, and you can still unlock the Palico (or Poogie) to this day. Anyway, look at this guy. An absolutely useless, flightless little chunk of a bird with not a thought behind those eyes. I'll fight Arkveld all by myself to get one. Computer, enhance.

The kids are with us! But the kids aren't necessarily playing the kinds of games I grew up on: You may have heard of that excruciatingly popular platform called Roblox where kids are pressured to spend their parents' money in games like \"Steal a Brainrot.\" (Which, to be fair, does sound like something you'd find on Newgrounds circa 2000, so maybe we're not all that different.) Earlier this week, I spoke to Newzoo director of market intelligence Emmanuel Rosier about what young gamers are up to, and two aspects of his perspective stuck out to me the most: Gen Alpha doesn't care if it can run Crysis.

It can be upgraded, too, which makes it more effective and able to latch onto enemies, pull them toward you, and knock them down. Unfortunately I can't just point you to a spot on the map like I did with the Dying Light: The Beast's Sawblade Launcher , because the grappling hook is a reward for completing a story quest, and it's a quest you probably won't advance to until you're a little more than halfway through the game. If you simply don't want to wait, you can rush through the story quests one right after another, but I would recommend doing at least a few sidequests along the way, too.

We got the first screenshots and pitch for Penguin Colony back in June: A reimagining of H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness, told from the perspective of a penguin. The original story centers on the discovery of an impossible lost city in the Antarctic and, it must be said, is told from the perspective of a Miskatonic University guy who goes crazy from all the alien stuff, not a penguin. Miskatonic U. faculty were some of Howard Philips Lovecraft's favorite guys to drive cuckoo, you see. The game's narrator, Howard Blakely, is a new character played by Brown, speaking to the penguin protagonist over vast distances⁠—though he's still a Miskatonic man. \"Our narrator is part of an expedition which has gone horribly wrong,\" Penguin Colony's Steam page explains. \"Having been called by the old ones, his brain no longer experiences time linearly.

I can't think of a time when I was solely obsessed with a singular FPS. Even at the height of a 2,000+ hour, multi-year relationship with Rainbow Six Siege, I still regularly played some Call of Duty and Overwatch with friends. That lack of focus probably explains why I was good but never great at Siege, but it's all part of a healthy FPS rotation. That's a thing we all have, right? A handful of shooters we bounce between throughout the year? Maybe you do it for your favorite singleplayer campaigns, or perhaps it's not even a conscious exercise, but it's natural to ebb and flow between familiar shooters that scratch different itches. Earlier this year, I started keeping track of my FPS rotation. I used Backloggd —a journaling site that's basically Letterboxd for games—to make a living list of the shooters I'm always playing, but never at the same time. Right now, my FPS rotation is at 10.

The game's set of licensed songs, which will be heard on vehicle radios, leaked when players like jackfrags managed to get a sneak preview of the game's credits, and let me tell you, it's a doozy. “Awake” – Godsmack “Bodies” – Drowning Pool “Break Stuff” – Limp Bizkit “Can’t Stop” – Red Hot Chili Peppers “Domination” – Pantera “Got Each Other” – The Interrupters ft. Rancid “Hey Man, Nice Shot” – Filter “Invaders Must Die” – The Prodigy “Making Love to Morgan Wallen” – Limp Bizkit “Master of War” – Bob Dylan “Nuthin’ But A G Thang” – Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg “Pain” – Chalk “You’ll Never Guess Who Died” – The Kinison “Battlefield: The After-party” by Henry Jackman & Limp Bizkit \"Can't Stop\" may be the name of a hit song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but it also seems like a worthy label for the level of discipline on display in this selection.…",

Blevins began his career as a pro gamer, and achieved some success, but was a relatively low-level streamer until 2017/18, when his fondness for Fortnite coincided with the game exploding in popularity. This led to some incredible numbers for Blevins, who became synonymous with the game on Twitch: thanks to team-ups with stars like Drake and Travis Scott, some streams were pulling in just under 700,000 live viewers. He was so big that in 2020 Epic added Ninja skins to the game. These days Blevin is still huge: the third most-popular streamer on Twitch, with over 67 million followers across platforms. But those kinds of numbers are now beyond him (or most anyone), and elements of the internet won't let him forget it. Blevins says every time he streams the \"haters\" are straight in to \"berate\" him for his lower viewership numbers: \"I think I'm the only streamer on the planet who was pulling 100,000 viewers [per stream] consistently, but now I get like seven or eight thousand across Twitch and YouTube,\" said Blevins. \"So that's somet…",

If you were a goth kid in the '90s, you are going to feel completely at home. Between two preview builds, I've now played about three hours of Bloodlines 2, and in terms of its authenticity, I'm sold. From the moonlit streets, to the moody fashion, to the derelict mansions and art deco apartments, it couldn't feel more like a world where sexy-cool vampires would be at home. And there's no shyness about taking the tabletop lore seriously—concepts like the Camarilla and the Masquerade aren't just background, they're core to the story. (Image credit: Paradox Interactive) It can feel a bit like Proper Noun Overload, and there is something inherently stuffy about a lot of the bloodsucker politics.

It's called Hyperfunk, and Team Reptile says it's \"2 seconds per second of evolved funkstyle.\" Based purely on Steam page description, the developer has achieved a 100% funkstyle increase since Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. I don't know if they do Nobel prizes for that kind of thing, but I think they should consider it. (Image credit: Team Reptile) If you don't find \"evolved funkstyle\" a particularly informative bit of phraseology, let me put it in more digestible terms. Team Reptile says Hyperfunk is \"an extreme trick and graffiti game from a bright future\" where graffiti crews battle \"with style and ideology of how to interpret this new world.\" To do that, they need to go fast. To go fast, they need to do tricks for boostpack energy. More combo, more speed. It's simple science. And judging fro…",

During a press conference yesterday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explained: \"The two technology teams have been discussing and architecting solutions now for probably coming up to a year, and the two architecture teams—well, it's three architecture teams—are working across, of course, the CPU architecture, as well as product lines for server and PCs.\" Why did we not know about these teams working together for the past few months? Simple, they kept schtum: \"There were no communications with anybody else, except between [Intel CEO] Lip-Bu, myself, and the technical teams that were working on this partnership, and we kept it really quiet.\" The partnership involves a $5 billion buy-in from Nvidia, and is expected to centre mostly around AI but we're hoping there's at least a smidge of gaming goodness to come from it.

Of course, you ideally need a beefy graphics card to game at 4K and certainly for today's big releases with spangly ray-traced visuals. But what if you don't have one but still need a big, high-resolution screen for work? Well, you can just run your games at 1080p, but then it'll look all blurry. One solution is the current in-thing in the world of displays: dual-mode monitors. These are natively 4K in resolution but, at the touch of a button, they switch to 1080p. To counter the inherent blurring this normally produces, manufacturers employ a host of clever pixel blending tricks, and our current recommendation for the best 4K dual-mode monitor, the Alienware AW2725QF , does a very good job of it all.

    "body": "The dust is beginning to settle on yesterday's Nvidia and Intel announcement , in which the two companies declared a collaboration to make new chips for both the data center and consumer markets. In a press conference yesterday evening, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang firmly stated that the Trump administration \"had no involvement in this partnership at all\", but there's evidence to suggest this may not be entirely the case. The announcement also broke the news of a $5 billion investment by Nvidia into Intel's common stock, at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. According to sources speaking to The New York Times , the Trump administration approached Nvidia in January and asked it to invest in the chipmaker. The US government has since made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel itself, which is now estimated to be worth $13 billion as a result of Intel's share price rising by near 23% off the back of yesterday's news. Writing on Substack, US semiconductor industry analyst Alex_Intel notes that Intel's chief financial officer stated that the company wasn't seeking any more stake sales at a recent Goldman Sachs conference. This could potentially be an indication that Intel paused its recent…",

I mean, who would have thought a few years ago that Intel would become financially unstable, dropping projects and thousands of staff , and then randomly announce a sizeable investment from Nvidia and a plan to collaborate on new chips ? Not many folks, that's for sure. Likewise, I should imagine only die-hard Team Red fans at the start of the decade would have predicted that the best choice for a new CPU , regardless of price point or use scenario, would be an AMD processor. And yet, all of the above have come to pass, and in the case of the last point, we've decided it's time to change our recommendation for the best budget gaming CPU. That honour used to go to Intel's Core i5 13400F , but no longer, as AMD's Ryzen 5 7600X is the sensible choice. (Image credit: Future) There's nothing actually wrong with the 13400F, as such, it's just that the 7600X is simply a better option. It's faster in games, and because it uses AMD's AM5 processor socket, you get far superior upgrade options. With the Core i5 13400F, all you can do is replace it with a 13th Gen or 14th Gen Core i7 or i9 chi…",

This came through most strongly from my discussion with Tiago Sada, chief product officer at Tools for Humanity . This company makes 'Orb' iris scanners for World , a Sam Altman co-founded company that's looking to create a global network of verified humans. The idea with proof-of-human/liveness detection is to, well, detect and prove that you're human, the goal being to combat bots on online services—even services such as gaming. Sada thinks that having some form of this tech across the board is inevitable: \"I think, if you look far ahead enough, let's say, like, five or 10 years, I have a lot of conviction that every single thing we do on the internet—whether it's a game, an app, a website—it will require proof-of-human.

Naturally, such a strange occurrence has led people to question just how it will affect current product roadmaps—especially Intel Arc. On that front, thankfully, Intel says things are business as usual. An Intel spokesperson has supplied a statement to the media saying that: \"collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings\" (via PC World and Hot Hardware ). That's pretty unambiguous, at least for the short term. Intel's roadmap, to be clear, currently includes at least two new generations of processor containing its Arc Xe3 iGPUs: Panther Lake and Nova Lake. The former should launch relatively soon, will be mobile (ie, laptop)-only, and will at least in part be made using the company's new 18A node—although early yields apparently aren't looking too promising . The latter will arrive later and should have both desktop and mobile options, just like current-gen Arrow Lake, and looks to be made on TSMC's N2 node.

Adventure of Samsara , which released on September 4, was more fated to obscurity than most, despite being published by an ascendant Atari. Because September 4 was also the day Silksong released. Few were going to make time for a handsome but orthodox pixel art metroidvania when the joys and indignities of Pharloom beckon. Except me: I needed a break from Silksong earlier this week, mostly because I was getting my ass kicked, but also because a small detail on the Adventure of Samsara Steam page piqued my interest. This is actually a spiritual sequel of sorts to the 1980 game Adventure , which was probably the most cryptic and sprawling Atari 2600 cart on the market. Adventure gave me nightmares as a child. Whereas most Atari 2600 games were cheerfully straightforward one-screen arcade games or scrolling shooters, Adventure had designs on being a full-blown, well, adventure, and it displayed some proto-metroidvania qualities to that end. You explore a same-ish labyrinth as a dot, collecting color-coded keys to unlock color-coded doors, avoiding bats and dragons, and using tools—such as a magne…",

The writer and director of 2022's Barbarian and this year's Weapons now has two solid horror hits under his belt, and is in pre-production on his next one: a Resident Evil movie planned for 2026. That's good news for Resident Evil fans who might otherwise be a bit wary about yet another new Resi movie—the film franchise was already rebooted once, just four years ago, with the thoroughly mid Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Cregger's track record, though based on a small sample size (at least when it comes to feature films) is a good reason to be optimistic. And for those wondering which game and characters this new Resi movie will be based on, it looks like the answer is: none of them. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Cregger confirmed that while the 2026 film will take place in the Resident Evil universe, \"It's an entirely original story,\" instead of being based on any one specific game. Cregger is also steering away from major Resident Evil characters like Leon S. Kennedy. \"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story. I think that would be presumptuous,\" Cregger told EW . \"But I respect the games enough where I'm gonna tell a Resi…",

Thanks to the efforts of a Tokyo contributor who was able to review the case file for the ongoing Pocketpair lawsuit, videogame patent law site Games Fray (which broke last week's Nintendo patent story) reports that part of Pocketpair's defense against Nintendo's lawsuit aims to invalidate Nintendo's patent claims based on the existence of prior art in mods. (Image credit: Pocketpair / Toasted Shoes / The Pokemon Company) As IP attorney Kirk Sigmon told PC Gamer last September, demonstrable prior art—meaning preexisting work resembling the invention described in a patent's claims—is bad news for patent holders, because it means they shouldn't have been granted the patent in the first place.

Despite the YouTuber's predilection for katanas and Sekiro, Ongbal only favored the Sekiro-parrying samurai character, Executor, early on, with his videos quickly transitioning to focus on Wylder gameplay.
