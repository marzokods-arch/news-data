The new “Gaming Copilot” feature was announced just last month and, as of Thursday it's already beginning its full beta roll-out to PC and coming to the Xbox mobile app in October. As the name suggests, it’s a gaming-specific version of Copilot that Microsoft calls “your personal gaming sidekick.” You can use Gaming Copilot to ask for tips, suggestions, summaries, info on achievements, and the like. It can analyze what’s on your screen for context, such as identifying an NPC you’re talking to (although their names are usually on screen anyway). You’re able to access this assistant directly through the Xbox Game Bar⁠—by default, pressing Windows+G on a keyboard or the Xbox button on one of the company's controllers. There’s also a voice mode and a \"mini mode\" for pinning the AI to your screen. While I can see how some gamers might find this useful, it's hard to see how it's more than an AI version of simply pulling up a guide on your phone or via the Steam browser. It also raises concerns about the potential for cheating in online games. After all, being able to ask an AI for live, personaliz…",

Along with a fix for the Depth level increase bug, this patch will also give you an option to voluntarily decrease your Depth level and add Depth level demotion protection for level three onward. You gain points toward promotion for winning runs, and lose points when you fail, meaning it's possible to be demoted, similar to competitive multiplayer ranks in other games. This new protection feature effectively gives you a second chance to hang on when you would otherwise get demoted starting at Depth level three. You then get two extra chances for levels four and five each. Lastly, this patch will also allow Steam players to return to an ongoing session if they get disconnected due to Steam server issues. The voluntary demotion, meanwhile, lets you turn down the heat if you need more practice or want to better accommodate lower-ranked friends. If you've tried the new Deep o…",

Even Giant Sparrow, the creator of What Remains of Edith Finch, hasn't released a game since. While I can't exactly say I've missed walking sims—there's been no shortage of other games to keep me occupied in the meantime—I certainly wouldn't mind a luscious, whimsical first-person narrative adventure to saunter around for a few hours. Fortunately, after years wandering through the wilderness, the walking sim has decided to pay us a visit. And it's all thanks to Arctic Awakening , a new and exceedingly pretty sci-fi narrative thriller developed by GoldFire Studios. Set in the near-future, Arctic Awakening sees you play as Kai, a bush pilot en-route on a supply run to a remote Alaskan town when his plane is downed by a sudden, violent storm. Dragging himself from the wreckage, Kai embarks upon a mission to find his missing copilot Donovan, braving harsh weather and exploring weird sci-fi structures in the process. Kai is accompanied on his adventure …",

The series, created by animator Krinkels, was a sort-of cultural after-dinner mint for fans of The Matrix. Madness' fast-paced, hyper-violent shorts involve grey, cross-faced people blasting each other to smithereens. Central to the series' appeal was how its action scenes grew more impressive and elaborate with every passing episode, and it was always fun to see how far Krinkels could push things when a new entry dropped. I haven't thought about Madness for a long time (though the series hasn't gone away, as I'll get to shortly). But those memories came flooding back when I spied Somewhere in Hell , a Doom 2 mod that goes to impressive lengths to recreate Madness' flashy, bloody action in id Software's shooter sequel. Somewhere in Hell basically replaces Doom's weapons and enemies with goons and firearms from Krinkels' animations. But what's impressive is how modder Recurracy 2 has infused the mod with the speed and vicious lethality of Krinkels' animations. The legions of monochromatic foes you face move across the …",

It is with open arms, therefore, that I welcome The Lift , a \"supernatural handyman simulator\" that takes the core premise of House Flipper but switches out its crumbling bungalows and mouldy condos for a massive, Soviet-core scientific facility.

For those unfamiliar with the art of medieval beermaking, Ale Abbey tasks players with founding a monastery in a boozy slice of Middle-Ages Europe, transforming it into the finest monkish brewery in Christendom. Your Fermentine order is founded on familiar management-sim mechanics, like building new rooms for your monastery, recruiting new brothers and sisters, and maintaining their general health and happiness. But Ale Abbey adds its own citrusy twist to this formula in the form of an elaborate brewing system. Instead of making pre-set beers, you create your own beverage through choosing a style of ale, picking what equipment you'll use to brew it, and adjusting variables like the quality and quantity of your grain, the temperature of your mash, and how long you choose to age it once barrelled. The 1.0 update adds eight new …",

Unfortunately I can't just point you to a spot on the map like I did with the Dying Light: The Beast's Sawblade Launcher , because the grappling hook is a reward for completing a story quest, and it's a quest you probably won't advance to until you're a little more than halfway through the game.

If you're wondering what's so unprofessional about the overview, he goes on to freestyle a few facts about the game, like how its ambient soundtrack is \"kind of subtle and cool and interesting, unlike anything you've ever played,\" before transitioning to what feels like the end of his spiel. \"Are you interested in novelty? Are you a novelty-seeking person? I don't know. You just want to play the same thing over and over again, maybe. Maybe you like League of Legends, that's fine. You're probably not going to buy this game … Alright. Hope you buy it. Goodbye.\" After this is said, there are seven minutes left to go in the video. Cuzzillo notes that he's \"not going to do the edit\" and then just… starts over and reintroduces \"the first fact\" about Baby Steps. This happens a few times, but there are some insights to be gleaned here. For instance…",

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. I can't think of a time when I was solely obsessed with a singular FPS. Even at the height of a 2,000+ hour, multi-year relationship with Rainbow Six Siege, I still regularly played some Call of Duty and Overwatch with friends. That lack of focus probably explains why I was good but never great at Siege, but it's all part of a healthy FPS rotation. That's a thing we all have, right? A handful of shooters we bounce between throughout the year? Maybe you do it for your favorite singleplayer campaigns, or perhaps it's not even a conscious exercise, but it's natural to ebb and flow between familiar shooters that scratch different itches. Earlier this year, I started keeping track of my FPS rotation. I used Backloggd —a journaling site that's basically Letterboxd for games—to make a living list of the shooters I'm always playing, but never at the same time. Right now, my FPS rotation is at 10.

Blevins began his career as a pro gamer, and achieved some success, but was a relatively low-level streamer until 2017/18, when his fondness for Fortnite coincided with the game exploding in popularity. This led to some incredible numbers for Blevins, who became synonymous with the game on Twitch: thanks to team-ups with stars like Drake and Travis Scott, some streams were pulling in just under 700,000 live viewers. He was so big that in 2020 Epic added Ninja skins to the game. These days Blevin is still huge: the third most-popular streamer on Twitch, with over 67 million followers across platforms. But those kinds of numbers are now beyond him (or most anyone), and elements of the internet won't let him forget it. Blevins says every time he streams the \"haters\" are straight in to \"berate\" him for his lower viewership numbers: \"I think I'm the only streamer on the planet who was pulling 100,000 viewers [per stream] consistently, but now I get like seven or eight thousand across Twitch and YouTube,\" said Blevins. \"So that's somet…",

In one of his first addresses to cardinals, Pope Leo said AI is \" another Industrial Revolution .\" In this latest interview, the Pope returns to the theme of human rights and dignity. \"If we automate the whole world and only a few people have the means with which to more…",

Playing through a new hands-on demo showing off more of its dark vision of Seattle, I'm struck by how much it nails the atmosphere of the original tabletop RPG. If you were a goth kid in the '90s, you are going to feel completely at home. Between two preview builds, I've now played about three hours of Bloodlines 2, and in terms of its authenticity, I'm sold. From the moonlit streets, to the moody fashion, to the derelict mansions and art deco apartments, it couldn't feel more like a world where sexy-cool vampires would be at home. And there's no shyness about taking the tabletop lore seriously—concepts like the Camarilla and the Masquerade aren't just background, they're core to the story. (Image credit: Paradox Interactive) It can feel a bit like Proper Noun Overload, and there is something inherently stuffy about a lot of the bloodsucker politics. But that's punctured nicely by the two playable characters—Phyre, an ancient vampire awoken from over hundred years of slumber, and Fabien, a disembodied 1940s vampire detective who lives in their head (for slightly tangled reaso…",

Of course, you ideally need a beefy graphics card to game at 4K and certainly for today's big releases with spangly ray-traced visuals.

One solution is the current in-thing in the world of displays: dual-mode monitors. These are natively 4K in resolution but, at the touch of a button, they switch to 1080p. To counter the inherent blurring this normally produces, manufacturers employ a host of clever pixel blending tricks, and our current recommendation for the best 4K dual-mode monitor, the Alienware AW2725QF , does a very good job of it all.

Included in this drop are over 10 million people leaving the PC platform entirely. Consoles, handhelds, and mobile all offer compelling value for the budget-limited gamer.\" It's not all down to people upping and leaving, though: \"A few million entry-level defectors are not actually leaving the PC platform but are migrating to the more expensive hardware tiers of midrange and high-end PC hardware.\" JPR seems to put at least some of this down to the impending ending of support for Windows 10 : \"Never before in the history of the Microsoft Windows operating system has there been a forced hardware migration requirement.

The benefits for the two companies are clear enough. Nvidia needs processors for GPU-accelerated server racks, and despite its best efforts to buy Arm, that fell through, dashing any hope of becoming a fully-integrated hardware company with it. Intel needs a helping hand in a few ways. The company is struggling with a falling share price and recently struck a deal with the US government to buy a share of the business, and getting an in with one of the richest companies on the planet isn't a bad get. Though supercharging its processors with more capable and powerful graphics chips has a few big benefits, too.

The announcement also broke the news of a $5 billion investment by Nvidia into Intel's common stock, at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. According to sources speaking to The New York Times , the Trump administration approached Nvidia in January and asked it to invest in the chipmaker. The US government has since made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel itself, which is now estimated to be worth $13 billion as a result of Intel's share price rising by near 23% off the back of yesterday's news.

Not many folks, that's for sure.

(Image credit: Future) There's nothing actually wrong with the 13400F, as such, it's just that the 7600X is simply a better option.

An Intel spokesperson has supplied a statement to the media saying that: \"collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings\" (via PC World and Hot Hardware ). That's pretty unambiguous, at least for the short term. Intel's roadmap, to be clear, currently includes at least two new generations of processor containing its Arc Xe3 iGPUs: Panther Lake and Nova Lake. The former should launch relatively soon, will be mobile (ie, laptop)-only, and will at least in part be made using the company's new 18A node—although early yields apparently aren't looking too promising .

Few were going to make time for a handsome but orthodox pixel art metroidvania when the joys and indignities of Pharloom beckon. Except me: I needed a break from Silksong earlier this week, mostly because I was getting my ass kicked, but also because a small detail on the Adventure of Samsara Steam page piqued my interest. This is actually a spiritual sequel of sorts to the 1980 game Adventure , which was probably the most cryptic and sprawling Atari 2600 cart on the market. Adventure gave me nightmares as a child. Whereas most Atari 2600 games were cheerfully straightforward one-screen arcade games or scrolling shooters, Adventure had designs on being a full-blown, well, adventure, and it displayed some proto-metroidvania qualities to that end.

That's good news for Resident Evil fans who might otherwise be a bit wary about yet another new Resi movie—the film franchise was already rebooted once, just four years ago, with the thoroughly mid Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Cregger's track record, though based on a small sample size (at least when it comes to feature films) is a good reason to be optimistic. And for those wondering which game and characters this new Resi movie will be based on, it looks like the answer is: none of them. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Cregger confirmed that while the 2026 film will take place in the Resident Evil universe, \"It's an entirely original story,\" instead of being based on any one specific game. Cregger is also steering away from major Resident Evil characters like Leon S. Kennedy. \"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story.

Thanks to the efforts of a Tokyo contributor who was able to review the case file for the ongoing Pocketpair lawsuit, videogame patent law site Games Fray (which broke last week's Nintendo patent story) reports that part of Pocketpair's defense against Nintendo's lawsuit aims to invalidate Nintendo's patent claims based on the existence of prior art in mods. (Image credit: Pocketpair / Toasted Shoes / The Pokemon Company) As IP attorney Kirk Sigmon told PC Gamer last September, demonstrable prior art—meaning preexisting work resembling the invention described in a patent's claims—is bad news for patent holders, because it means they shouldn't have been granted the patent in the first place.

Despite the YouTuber's predilection for katanas and Sekiro, Ongbal only favored the Sekiro-parrying samurai character, Executor, early on, with his videos quickly transitioning to focus on Wylder gameplay.
