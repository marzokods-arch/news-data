The latest Sora model launched today alongside a dedicated app , with its key social pitch being features that allow you to remix your friends' creations and upload your own likeness into AI-generated videos. Altman claims there are in-app mitigations against the misuse of someone's likeness.

    "body": "EA went private in a Saudi-backed $55 billion deal earlier this week, and pretty much no one with a net worth south of $100 million is happy about it. Least happy of all? The staff of EA's myriad studios, who now have to wonder if their jobs are going under the guillotine to make Mohammed bin Salman and Jared Kushner's pocketbooks a little happier. With EA now on the hook for a $20 billion debt to JP Morgan in the wake of its leveraged buyout, frantic cost-cutting (and, joy of joys, AI ) seems inevitable. Especially worried are the staff at BioWare, which hasn't chalked up an unalloyed win since 2021's Mass Effect Legendary Edition and which hasn't chalked one up with an actually new game since 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. In a chat with Insider Gaming , anonymous staff at the RPG developer sound like they're just waiting for the axe to fall. \"I’ve been doing it since last year, but I’m making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,\" said one source, who added that it \"Kind of feels like a matter of time\" before things turn dark for the studio.

    "body": "Minecraft has shared some details about its fourth game drop of the year, Mounts of Mayhem. As always though, the first round of information includes some exciting additions the game can expect, but doesn't expose a lot of details like a release date. Luckily the official blog post about the drop, alongside the announcement at Minecraft Live 2025, has still given us plenty of information to dissect. As the title suggests, this update is all about adding new mounts to the game and a few items to improve the experience you currently have with mounts. As it stands, you're only able to ride horses, donkeys, mules, camels and pigs in Minecraft, so it'll be nice to shake things up and get new mounts to help you traverse open stretches of water as well as just land. Especially now you can craft a saddle. Here's everything we currently know about the Mounts of Mayhem update. When will the Mounts of Mayhem update be released in Minecraft? The Mounts of Mayhem update doesn't have a release date yet, and seeing as the Copper Age drop just launched, it will be a few months before we see the next update rolled out. With that said, this update has been referred to as the fourth drop of 2025, so…",

    "body": "Honeycomb is the only way you'll be able to wax your copper crafts and prevent them from oxidising in Minecraft , so knowing where to find honeycomb is pretty important. Especially if you have copper golems sorting out your base, or you've decorated floor to ceiling with various copper items. Luckily, it's not too challenging to gather as long as you've got the right tools and know where to look. A good way to start your hunt for honeycomb is by looking for bees, which spawn most frequently in meadow biomes. Venture to your nearest one, and you can start following them to their hive. But, you won't just be able to walk up to it and harvest honeycomb like you're using a chest. Here's what you need to do instead. Where to find honeycomb in Minecraft The key to gathering honeycombs is by locating a bee nest. But, rather than any old nest, you're looking for one that has already been pollinated and is filled with honey . This is indicated by the spots on the side of the hive, which are usually brown and dark, appearing golden and honey coloured. When you've found one, walk up to it and use shears, and up to three honeycombs will drop. Shearing a nest or hive will anger the bees inside…",

The clip (embedded above) shows Call of Duty pro Simp using one of Blops 7's new killstreak rewards, The Gravemaker, a sniper rifle whose wielder can see, and snipe, through solid walls. The go-to joke is that Activision has given up on combating cheaters and decided to just put wallhacking into the game. I sort of get the indignation, because it doesn't look fun to be on the receiving end of a bullet that was fired through two layers of concrete by someone you never could've seen, but I also sort of don't get it, because aren't all Call of Duty killstreaks like that? How is this less fair than someone calling in an attack helicopter or carpet bombing part of the map? In some of these games you can call in a tactical nuke. A nuclear bomb! Granted, the specific post I've shared is directed at the pro scene—\"GA\" refers to a \"gentlemen's agreement\" not to use certain guns or abi…",

There were the hosts, overflowing with excitement for Black Ops 7's meager alterations to CoD's current form. There were the hyped creators in attendance, many of whose livelihoods are directly intertwined with the success of Call of Duty. And there was Black Ops 7 itself, a back-to-back sequel that not even its developers appear to feel strongly about. It was the pinnacle of videogame marketing excess: loud, abrasive, and insecure. Between extended ad reads for Little Caesars Pizza, AMD, Monster Energy, and Herman Miller chairs, we were treated to Black Ops 7 multiplayer with live commentary that fluctuated between 3 am infomercial and awkward riffing over gameplay that could easily be mistaken for the last handful of games.

Crossroads of Ravens begins as it means to go on. Chapter two opens with a description of a peasant standing in fresh cowshit to keep his feet warm. It's a book about the mud and muck of its medieval world, one that jams its characters into moral quagmires as well as physical ones. It's a prequel to the Witcher series, set shortly after Geralt finishes his training at the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen under Vesemir and is let loose into the world. He's like a fresh-faced graduate right out of the education system suddenly having to deal with an adult world he isn't prepared for.

In a new AMA on Reddit , Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski said the whole idea of individual Witcher schools is based on a mistake, and it hasn't gone away because \"videogame people\" won't let it go. \"A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish,\" Sapkowski explained. \"I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never. \"However, that one sentence was enough.

However, translating that into Minecraft blocks took up a considerable amount of space.

Developer Mainframe Industries painted a vivid picture of clashing kingdoms, a player-run economy, and even the ability to become, essentially, the Pope. What we got initially was a pretty generic survival crafting game where simply making a pair of trousers took almost as long as it would in real life. Since then, the team's introduced player-to-player trading, a magic system, an expanded PvP area and a variety of tweaks and changes—including the world itself being transformed, to better facilitate more players and building projects. And now it's gearing up to leave early access, with the 1.0 launch set for October 16 . Unfortunately, the players never really took to it, outside of the diehards. Active players quickly tapered off following the early access launch, with only small spikes thanks to notable updates. But even that seems to have stopped. This month, a big PvP update went live , and it didn't move the needle at all. Since early July, it's been stuck under 1,000 concurrents, and this month it's been averaging around 300.

(Image credit: Hexecutable) It's shocking how many parallels I was able to draw between Jenny's experience and my own, both growing up and even now well into my adulthood. The self-deprecation, the ever-piling goals for what is ultimately an unattainable lifestyle, the not-too-subtle comments from family members. Accidentally making dieting your entire personality.

The Arctis Nova Elite launches today, September 30, for $600/£600/€650. Okay, if you're still with me, let's talk specs. The headset looks a lot like the $325 Arctis Nova Pro —from the swooped back earcups and placement of the ANC and boom arms, to the desktop hub included with both sets. SteelSeries says it teamed up with a designer here, Jakob Wagner, but the external differences appear to be mostly material. Literally—the Elite has a little more metal, including the control wheel on the side, which might explain the added weight. The Elite weighs 380 grams. The Pro, 338 grams. But under the hood, there are some changes. The Elite's drivers are touted as carbon fibre. Rated to the same frequency response as the Pro's 40 mm drivers, 10 - 40,000 Hz, the carbon fibre cans are more sensitive with a dBSPL of 101 to the Pro's 98.

In other words, I'm stuck with it until I get a better equivalent to drop. Unfortunately, it has the annoying trait of being…ummm…horny? Every 30 seconds or so, the Cindershelly will let out a moan, call you a worm, or one of many more rather promiscuous voice lines. You could be exploring a vault or listening to a quest—like, perhaps, the Timekeeper invading your friends' brains and threatening you —and your shield will randomly pipe up to put you in your place.

So, why did The Serial port then strap 12 dial up modems together, specifically ? To utilise Multilink PPP and attempt to stream YouTube over multiple 56 Kbps internet connections. After a little bit of maths, the creators worked out that they'd need at least a 182,286 bits per second connection to watch one of their own recent uploads at 240p resolution (YouTube's lowest video quality on desktop) without buffering.

EA Sports has been making football games since 1993's FIFA International Soccer, but FIFA and EA had a falling out in 2023 which led to EA striking out on its own with EA Sports FC 24. It was a strong entry, but felt incremental. EA Sports FC 24 felt like a FIFA game, rather than a significant step forwards.

As Grace and Alyssa search what looks to be yet another Spencer Mansion, they're plagued by unholy beasts and a crusty creep in a raincoat—typical Resident Evil shenanigans. All of which is enough to send me into a bout of anxious excitement, as I picture the mental toll some of these scares are going to have on my fragile psyche. But while I, and anyone else with a working amygdala, can see how terrifying Requiem is going to be, it turns out that the scares are kind of lost on the dev team. \"We've made so many of these that we can't tell anymore until someone else plays it,\" director Koshi Nakanishi says (via IGN ). \"There was actually a bit of a worry internally before we showed the Resident Evil Requiem hands-off at SGF and the first hands-on at Gamescom, was this actually scary?

You'll unlock UVH 1 automatically once you complete the campaign and the short introductory Ultimate Vault Hunter missions, which involve learning about Firmware, tracking down Maurice's Black Market location, and beating a Wildcard Mission. It's heavily tutorialised, but once that's out of the way, you're left to your own devices. So, here's exactly what you need to do to unlock Ultimate Vault Hunter 2 and beyond. How to unlock all Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode ranks in Borderlands 4 There are currently five Ultimate Vault Hunter ranks for you to progress through, with at least one more coming in the first Invincible Boss free content update at the end of the year.

If you're not familiar, OpenMW is an open-source engine reimplementation for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind that lets you run it on modern Windows, Linux, and macOS with a minimum of fuss and at modern resolutions. It's undoubtedly my go-to way to play these days, especially now this 0.50 release candidate has made the game way easier to play on a gamepad. Don't tell anyone, but my first exposure to Morrowind was its original Xbox version, with its uncharismatic sans-serif fonts and its tendency to slyly reboot your entire console to cope with its strict RAM limits. I still have nostalgia for its gamepad iteration and, hell, I just like being able to kick back on my sofa or play things easily on my Steam Deck. \"Despite the nice round number, 0.50.0 is a focused release,\" writes OpenMW's capo (that's their name, not their rank), \"its core highlight is…",

Riot says that offline mode will still work, so players should still be able to hit the lab, play local multiplayer, and face off against CPUs. Three-and-a-half days to do some tinkering behind the scenes is nothing in the grand scheme of things, especially when I think about other fighting games who took their betas offline and straight-up vanished for a year— looking at you, Multiversus.

Six months ago a single bitcoin was worth less than $100,000. Six years ago it was around $3,000. Qian is said to have received the bitcoin from large-scale fraud in China, with over 128,000 victims pouring their cash into Qian's investments.
