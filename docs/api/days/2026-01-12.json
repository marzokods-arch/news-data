    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google’s new universal checkout protocol aims to complete the purchase for you directly within a Gemini chat or AI search interface. Google built the Universal Commerce Protocol with input from major players like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair, with more than 20 partners already signed on. The new “Business Agents” also let brands answer shopper questions in conversational results using their own product knowledge. Imagine asking your phone for new running shoes, and instead of just getting links, an AI finds and buys them for you, so you don’t have to switch between tabs. That future is now much closer. Google has unveiled a new open-standard framework that aims to make autonomous, AI-led shopping a real part of how we buy things online. At the center of this change is a protocol called Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP). It serves as a common language, enabling AI agents to connect with retailers, payment systems, and shopping platforms without requiring custom connections.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has been using the same camera sensors on its Galaxy S Ultra devices since 2023. This could change next year with the Galaxy S27 Ultra, slated to feature an upgraded sensor. Latest leak says that while the camera will have the same format, it will pack newer technologies, though details are rife at the moment. Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy S26 series soon, most likely in the last week of February. But even with weeks remaining for one of Samsung’s biggest unveilings of the year, leaks and rumors about Samsung’s next generation of flagships are already gushing in. While Samsung has slept on upgrading the hardware, specifically the camera, over the last few generations of its Galaxy S series phones, the Galaxy S27 Ultra may finally bring some improvements. Last week, we leaned into the possibilities of these upgrades, suggesting that three of the four rear cameras on the Galaxy S27 Ultra could be upgraded to newer sensors . And today, we’re learning a bit more about the primary camera sensor. According to the leaker Ice Universe , the Galaxy S27 Ultra will be stocked with a new camera sensor, which is expected to be called …",

In a recent interview with Billy Morrison on SiriusXM, Jack Osbourne shared that he, his wife and his daughters have all independently experienced similar dreams involving the Black Sabbath frontman. “We all keep having dreams about him. In the dreams, he is laughing,” Jack Osbourne said. “And he is saying, ‘Just stop f&#8212;ng crying’. He’s laughing every time. Me and my wife, my daughters, all the same thing. We keep seeing him in our dreams, laughing.” Morrison, who was speaking with Osbourne during the broadcast, also said he had experienced a similar dream about Ozzy. “I’ve seen him. He’s good, Jack. He’s not in pain,” Morrison said, according to the interview. Ozzy Osbourne died in July 2025 at age 76 after suffering a heart attack. He had faced a number of health challenges in recent years, including Parkinson’s disease and coronary artery disease. His death came just 17 days after he played his final live performance in his hometown of Birmingham, England, a benefit concert that raised millions for children’s charities and…",

We’ve heard for months now that the Samsung Galaxy S26 series could get a 24MP shooting mode via the Camera Assistant app. Now, a trusted tipster has revealed more details about this capability. Twitter tipster Ice Universe posted more apparent information about this shooting mode, corroborating reports that it needs to be enabled in the Camera Assistant app first. Once you’ve turned on this feature, it’ll be available as an option in the Galaxy S26’s default camera app.",

Even the early beta catalog gave me access to far more music than I could ever hope to fit on my iPod Nano, and, more importantly, made discovering new artists and exploring new genres unbelievably easy. Many of us probably owe a huge debt to streaming platforms for shaping our musical tastes and expanding our libraries. While the music streaming space has grown with both bigger libraries and a variety of new players, many of today’s top streaming platforms are quickly morphing into the very antithesis of the formula that made them such a game-changer. Unsurprisingly, it’s driven by that most modern of problems: AI slop.",

The small satellite is now awaiting instrument calibration following a successful integration in Canada and rigorous testing by engineers at the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

This would provide valuable insight into such events, which are also detected through gravitational waves by observatories on Earth. These events are where most of the heavy metals in the universe, such as gold and platinum, are formed.

We now have our first visual proof that Perplexity AI is Bixby’s new brain. A new Bixby Live interface hints at real-time AI conversations, mirroring Gemini Live capabilities. Samsung’s Bixby has spent the better part of the decade being the assistant we love to disable, but the new One UI 8.5 update could make that decision harder. Rather than competing directly with Google Gemini, Samsung is reportedly following Apple’s lead by bringing in stronger AI support . We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ). In these images, Bixby sends complex questions to Perplexity instead of using its own limited knowledge. The responses look more like well-researched answers, complete with citations.",

We can build incredibly fast chips, but run them too fast, and they’re going to start to melt down. As a result, nearly every device we use has to make some sort of balance between performance and thermal emissions. This year at CES in Las Vegas , we’re learning about an innovative new way that xMEMS is trying to tackle that problem, giving even compact mobile devices another option for staying cool.

In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands.

While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation.

Then, I heard about Even Realities and its updated Even G2 design, and decided that I’d put my spotty history on the shelf for a day.

The NAD found some T-Mobile claims about competitor price hikes and satellite coverage to be exaggerated or unsubstantiated, while others were reasonable and supported. Unsurprisingly, T-Mobile has clarified plans to appeal the decisions it disagrees with. It’s no secret that AT&amp;T and T-Mobile’s rivalry has intensified significantly over the last half year or so. AT&amp;T not only unveiled an ad campaign around T-Mobile’s so-called Un-Truths late last year, but it also sued its rival over T-Mobile’s new Switching tool, and it even brought complaints of false advertising to the National Advertising Division (NAD). The NAD has now officially responded to the complaints, agreeing that T-Mobile might have gone a bit too far with some of its recent claims. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

To say that many of us were disappointed by what we saw — or what we didn’t see, to be fair — would be an understatement. Android 16 felt like Android 15.1, a minor upgrade with some interesting new features, but nothing more. A lot of what was promised with Android 16 didn’t come with that first release. Instead, it took a few months and a couple of quarterly updates, but it’s obvious to me now that Android 16 is the best Android version we’ve had in many years.",

And even if you went the robot lawn mower route before, installing base stations and perimeter wires is another complicated and tedious chore. Segway Navimow addresses both of these concerns and more with their latest robot lawn mowers. Navimow showed off five new lineups at CES 2026 – four ideal for residential use, while a new series marks the brand’s first foray into commercial lawn mowing. The i2, H2, X4, and Terranox series address very different yard types, from simple suburban lawns to complex, obstacle-dense landscapes and extreme terrain. And most importantly, they make lawn maintenance a breeze.",

Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.

The Palette 300 will become available in early Q2 2026, with pre-orders starting in early Q1 2026. As expected, CES 2026 has been full of unique and interesting product announcements, ranging from a fuzzy emotional support buddy to the world’s first wireless 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos system . One announcement that shouldn’t be overlooked involves a 3D printer that offers something you won’t find on other 3D printers. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Mammotion TL;DR Mammotion showed off two flagship robots at CES 2026 that aim to remove manual lawn mowing and pool cleaning almost entirely. The LUBA 3 mower combines all-wheel drive with upgraded Tri-Fusion Navigation, including 360° LiDAR, dual-camera AI vision, and NetRTK for ±1 cm accuracy. The SPINO S1 Pro pool cleaner features AutoShoreCharge, a robotic arm system that automatically lifts the unit out of the water and docks it for charging. Outdoor maintenance can be tough. Wrestling with a mower on a steep hill or pulling a heavy pool cleaner from the water makes the dream of a perfect yard feel like hard work. Mammotion wants to change that, and its CES 2026 showcase shows it’s almost there. The company is doubling down on its “true hands-free” philosophy, introducing two new flagship robots: the LUBA 3 lawn mower and the SPINO S1 Pro pool cleaner.",

You may not receive an alert if the “Notifications” permission is turned off or the app is terminated. Have you ever lost an earbud because it unexpectedly fell out of your ear?

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile is raising its Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee by $0.50 per line starting January 21. Combined with the $.50 hike in April of 2025, fees are up about $1 in less than a year. The vague fee structure continues to draw criticism, though grandfathered plans with taxes and fees included are unaffected. Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees. We’ve already seen the company increase its telco fees as recently as last April, but it looks like the company is doing it again. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
