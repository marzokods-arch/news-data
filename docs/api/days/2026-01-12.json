    "body": "TL;DR Apple finished 2025 as the world’s top smartphone brand in terms of units shipped, extending its lead over Samsung thanks to faster year-on-year growth. Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",

Samsung could update the sensors themselves and tweak other camera features. However, significant hardware upgrades aren’t expected. Samsung may reduce the phone’s weight from Flip 7’s 188g to just 150g with this upcoming model. Many recent leaks have been for the Galaxy Z Fold 8 and the wide Fold 8 , rather than the Galaxy Z Flip 8 . We’re still expecting an update to the foldable, and today, we finally have more information on what camera upgrades the Flip 8 could be packing.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR A Redditor has shared what appears to be a more sophisticated IMEI scam. The user claimed that a stranger with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses asked to make a call from their phone, but accessed the device’s IMEI number. It almost goes without saying that you shouldn’t let strangers use your phone for any claimed reason. All smartphones have an IMEI number , which is effectively the phone’s ID number. Unfortunately, cybercriminals and other bad actors often steal IMEI numbers to facilitate crimes. Now, a Redditor has outlined a rather crazy IMEI scam. Redditor Prudent-Vacation-581 reported that a person with Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses recently asked to make a call from their phone. The Redditor reported that the stranger instead dialed *#06#, which reveals the device’s IMEI number, gave the phone back, and “ran away.” The user received a pop-up on their phone the following day, noting that the device is now unlocked.",

Google built the Universal Commerce Protocol with input from major players like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair, with more than 20 partners already signed on. The new “Business Agents” also let brands answer shopper questions in conversational results using their own product knowledge. Imagine asking your phone for new running shoes, and instead of just getting links, an AI finds and buys them for you, so you don’t have to switch between tabs. That future is now much closer. Google has unveiled a new open-standard framework that aims to make autonomous, AI-led shopping a real part of how we buy things online.

Latest leak says that while the camera will have the same format, it will pack newer technologies, though details are rife at the moment. Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy S26 series soon, most likely in the last week of February. But even with weeks remaining for one of Samsung’s biggest unveilings of the year, leaks and rumors about Samsung’s next generation of flagships are already gushing in. While Samsung has slept on upgrading the hardware, specifically the camera, over the last few generations of its Galaxy S series phones, the Galaxy S27 Ultra may finally bring some improvements. Last week, we leaned into the possibilities of these upgrades, suggesting that three of the four rear cameras on the Galaxy S27 Ultra could be upgraded to newer sensors .

Even the early beta catalog gave me access to far more music than I could ever hope to fit on my iPod Nano, and, more importantly, made discovering new artists and exploring new genres unbelievably easy. Many of us probably owe a huge debt to streaming platforms for shaping our musical tastes and expanding our libraries. While the music streaming space has grown with both bigger libraries and a variety of new players, many of today’s top streaming platforms are quickly morphing into the very antithesis of the formula that made them such a game-changer. Unsurprisingly, it’s driven by that most modern of problems: AI slop.",

That’s when I realized it had a few things I actually hadn’t backed up. After all, the data on a temporary or secondary device is generally less important than the data on one that you used as a daily driver.

The small satellite is now awaiting instrument calibration following a successful integration in Canada and rigorous testing by engineers at the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

This would provide valuable insight into such events, which are also detected through gravitational waves by observatories on Earth. These events are where most of the heavy metals in the universe, such as gold and platinum, are formed. To date, only one such event has been observed simultaneously in gravitational waves and gamma-rays; StarBurst is expected to find up to 10 per year. StarBurst arrived at NASA Marshall in March 2025.

We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ).

It’s expected to launch in 2026 and will adopt a wider aspect ratio than most book-style foldables, so the iPhone unfolds into a layout somewhat similar to that of an iPad Mini. And one of its priorities is likely to build a folding inner screen without a visible crease. In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR OPPO is reportedly planning a dual-launch for 2026, featuring the Find N6 in February and a wider Find N7 in September. The Find N6 is expected to be a powerhouse with a 200MP primary camera, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and a 6,000mAh battery. The Find N7 will adopt a wider, passport-like form factor to directly compete with the anticipated iPhone Fold and Samsung’s wide foldable. Foldables are expected to receive more attention than usual this year, primarily due to Apple’s entry into the market with the iPhone Fold . This iPhone Fold is expected to feature a wider form factor than currently popular book-style foldables, and companies like Samsung are expected to launch their own wide foldable (alongside the regular Galaxy Z Fold 8) to compete. Samsung won’t be the only Android brand launching two book-style foldables this year, as it appears even OPPO will join the party with its own wide foldable.

Some Galaxy owners have recently complained that their phones are stuck on old Google Play system updates . Samsung has since outlined the reason for this issue, but it looks like a few Galaxy owners are now receiving fresher updates. GalaxyClub and some Redditors report that their Samsung phones are now receiving more recent Google Play system updates. It appears that these devices are receiving the November 2025 Google Play system update, although one Reddit user mentions that their device has received the January 2026 update.",

If someone hasn’t customized your card already, they’ll see your version when you call. Google introduced Calling Cards for Android last year. Just like iOS, Calling Card on Android lets you customize how incoming calls from friends and family appear on your phone. It’s a great feature, but has been lacking something big Apple offers with Contact Posters on iPhones since the feature came around. While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation. We found that Google is working on a new “My calling card” option inside the Phone by Google app to allow you to set up your own Calling Card that would appear for other users when you call them. At the time, the setting existed, but it didn’t actually do anything. Now, we can show you exactly how you’ll be able to set up your own calling card.",

This marks the global debut of their latest AR glasses, which were launched in China last year. With the Air 4 Pro, RayNeo aims to deliver a cinema-like experience in a lightweight wearable form factor. It claims that these are the world’s first HDR10 AR displays, offering brighter highlights, deeper shadows, and enhanced color and contrast within the AR experience. A Pixelworks-customized Vision 4000 chip offers real-time video enhancements, such as upscaling SDR content to HDR and converting 2D videos into 3D.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google might have begun working on navigation support for Android XR using Google Maps. Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.

From richer widgets to personalized wallpapers, the smartphone lock screen is becoming more personal, useful, and visually engaging.
