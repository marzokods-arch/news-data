In fact, only one feature has been revealed so far, and much like the Spring to Life drop from March 2025, it will change the appearance of mobs we're so used to seeing. Yes, it's baby mobs . But even though we've only seen this one feature so far, it's still worth getting excited about—especially if you're an avid farmer or general animal lover and tend to spend more time with the mobs in the overworld rather than the monsters underground. Here's everything you need to know about Minecraft's first update for 2026. When will the Minecraft baby mob update release? There is no concrete release date for the first Minecraft drop for 2026, though it's safe to assume it will roll out this spring.

And what with all the signs suggesting the memory crisis will get worse before it gets better , these are certainly desperate times. So, here's one solution: Make your own memory sticks. That's exactly what one Russian modder claims to have done ( via Videocardz ). Now, breaking ground on a new fab to actually manufacture memory chips might be a bit beyond the wit of even the most enthusiastic DIY'er. But where there's a will... The modder, who goes by the handle VIK-on, used a pair of 16 GB DDR5 laptop SODIMMs as a starting point. The next step was to source a compatible PCB with the aim of combining all 32 GB onto a single homebrew DIMM. Reportedly, the total cost of the build was $218, about a third of the going rate in Russia for a 32 GB DDR5 stick. Nice. VIK-on also looked into using even cheaper 8 GB sticks to source memory chips, but it seems the chip packaging raises problems when it comes to creating 32 GB sticks. Are laptop teardowns and RAM chip harvesting the future of desktop PC gaming...? (Image credit: Future) Of course, as you'd expect, this isn't an easy process.

This time, though, the company is responding directly to the idea that memory manufacturers like itself are to blame for rising consumer memory prices. Tech publication Wccftech asked Micron's VP of Marketing, Mobile and Client Business Unit, Christopher Moore, about this. Moore said: \"Our viewpoint is that we are trying to help consumers around the world. We're just doing it through different channels … What's going on right now is that the TAM [total addressable market] and data center is growing just absolutely tremendously. And we want to make sure that, as a company, we help fulfill that TAM as well.\" \"This is not a Micron issue, it's an industry issue, where us and our peers or our competitors are all rushing to service these segments as much as we can, and there's just not enough supply to go around … Memory manufacturers are scrambling to build newer production lines, yet constraints of the process eventually forces them to push the timelines ahead by several quarters, which means that for the average consumer, the DRAM shortages could persist for quite some time now, or at lea…",

While you may think AI is yet again to blame , data centres don't typically use consumer-grade kit, and are otherwise operating with an amount of hardware that pales in comparison to the millions of PCs consumers buy every year. No, something even more fundamental may be to blame here. The leaked missive is reportedly from Guangzhou Xinhongzheng Electronic Technology to its partners and claims price increases are the result of rising upstream raw material costs for copper, silver, and tin (via Videocardz ). The letter goes on to explain that new orders for CPU coolers will see a price increase ranging from 6% to 8%, and power supplies will be subject to an uptick between 6% and 10%. It's worth noting that the leaked letter has yet to be independently verified.

Notably, the Pulsar Feinman Noctua edition and NF-A12X25 G2 chromax.black have moved from the first quarter (Q1) of 2026 to Q2, and the Antec Flux Pro Noctua edition is now the only product set for release in Q1. The Pulsar Feinmann Noctua Edition, being a neat mouse with a fan in it , intrigued us last year, and a potential launch in Q2 means it will be here in time for the hottest months of the year. From Q2 estimations in the last roadmap, the 140 mm desk fan, USB fan controller and Seasonic Prime PX HPD Noctua edition have all moved back to Q3 this year. If the desk fan is anything like the 120 mm NV-FS1 , it will be pricey and very cool. I can't help but feel like there's a missed opportunity in not launching in the height of the summer, though.

Which is fair, works in progress are, indeed, works in progress . It'll really depend on which direction Larian swings the needle—D&D's action economy has a heavy reliance on crowd control, given you only have one action per turn (alongside a bonus action and movement).

The Seattle offices of Valve Corporation—a plucky upstart company co-founded by Washington businessman Gabe \"Gaben\" Newell—must have been abuzz recently, when its videogame storefront Steam pipped a steamy milestone in its concurrent user metrics. Sorry, I've written so many articles about Steam's concurrent user records that I decided to try talking about it like a local news channel covering a bake sale, just to see how it feels. Anyway, over the weekend (Sunday, to be exact), Steam broached the 42 million concurrent user limit, hitting a new record of 42,042,778 users online at the same time (per SteamDB ). Not a bad way to kick off the year, if you're a titanic videogame storefront. Which, yes, on the one hand, is hardly a surprise. Steam's growth has been relentless and undaunted for ages. It hit 41 million in October , 40 million in March , and 39 million in December 2024 . I suspect I will see you back here in a few months when it hits 43 million. On and on it goes. But! Credit where it's due: these are fairly bleak times for this whole PC gaming thing. Also, the entire rest of society, but let's stay focused. As you're no doubt excruciati…",

The AI boom has led to ever-increasing investment into the company, and so it's really in Nvidia's interest for the world to be all in on the potential benefits of AI. Huang reflects on the AI naysayers in a recent interview with No Priors (via Business Insider ). The Nvidia leaders and No Priors hosts Elad Gil and Sarah Guo venture down a lot of paths during the nearly 80-minute conversation, including what happens to jobs under an AI future, and when we might see a 'god AI'. One key point is the various narratives around the ethics of the machine learning tech. Huang argues the world of the future is one where AI leads to more jobs: \"People say, 'gosh, all of these robots that we're talking about. It's going to take away jobs'. As we know very clearly, we don't have enough factory workers. Our economy is actually limited by the number of factory workers we have.\" Huang therefore argues that robotics will lead to a huge repair industry, and that will naturally lead to more jobs. Huang elaborates that, under the new age of AI, tasks and jobs are different things. He clarifies t…",

Even after all this time, it's safe to say that there are a lot of people eager to check out what this crack team of Minecraft modders has been up to. Below I'll go over the Hytale launch times in your region so you know if you need to book the day off work or call in sick. When is the Hytale unlock time? Based on the official countdown , Hytale launches at 7 am PST on Tuesday, January 13 , finally letting everyone get their hands on the game after seven long years of waiting. It launches simultaneously across all regions (and there's no advanced access), but take note that Hytale's early access is only available on Windows PCs right now—Mac and Linux support is coming later.

That's because it's part of the Best of Platinum Collection on Fanatical, which is a real doozy. In case you're not familiar with how these deal bundles work, you can get three to four games for $3.33 a pop, five to nine games for $3 each, or over 10 games for $2.90—basically, your minimum spend is at least $10, but you are getting some solid value for some excellent games (prices in GBP are the same, which isn't how conversion rates work, Fanatical). The list includes: Fallout 76, which I hear is actually pretty good nowadays Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition, which is worth it by virtue of being Fallout: New Vegas Fallout 3, which I'm blood-pact obligated to tell you is inferior to New Vegas, but still worth playing Disco Elysium, a game PC Gamer absolutely loves to bits , myself included DOOM (2016), a real solid FPS by any metric Robocop: Rogue City, which caused our very own And…",

It conspicuously did not appear at the CES show , but it's now been spotted in an Intel Panther Lake driver package, keeping hopes just barely alive. As we understand it, somebody at the CES show rifled through the driver files of a laptop demo'ing Intel's new Core Ultra Series 3 chip and found references to the increasingly mythical G31 GPU . Someone downloaded the graphics driver for a Panther Lake laptop model and discovered that the folders include firmware for the BMG-G31Driver link: https://ftp[dot]hp[dot]com/pub/softpaq/sp165501-166000/sp165849.exe pic.twitter.com/S0Jr8v1AN2 January 10, 2026 We have, of course, seen what feels like countless references to B770 or G31 over the past year or so . But the card stubbornly refuses to make an official appearance. It could be that Intel has never been planning to release such a GPU for the consumer market, and all of these rumours and leaks are for nought. But if the B770 is real, why didn't it appear at CES?

Even then Anthem had its diehards, and the patches and updates that followed addressed some of its more significant flaws. Not enough to save it unfortunately, but enough to guarantee a small but dedicated community of Freelancers who have suited up and returned to Fort Tarsis for the final day before EA pulls the plug on Anthem for good . Our Lauren Morton is one of the players who logged on to say goodbye. \"It's not empty,\" she says, \"but it is quiet.\" There are Twitch streamers running missions until the end, and high-level veterans \"waving and jumping and emoting\" around the Launch Bay.

But there is one specific bird sound, a tremolo warble that I know from Age of Empires, which I seem to hear more than anything else. Mostly it's in pop songs. It plays repeatedly over the outro of Anaconda by Nicki Minaj , and you can hear it in Babylon by Lady Gaga . It's in Pacific State by 808 State and Animals Beat by Skrillex . It's in multiple tracks by Aphex Twin. I think it's in Michael Jackson's Thriller, but that might be a different sample of the same call, and I'm halfway convinced it's been used in heavily processed form in Lana Del Rey's Million Dollar Man . According to Who Sampled , it's in at least 190(!) tracks. Basically, anywhere someone wants things to sound a bit wild and maybe like you're in the jungle, this is the go-to bird cry.

They decided to stick around and support it a bit more when the game started selling like hotcakes, but co-creator Nick Kaman told Game File there's still a lot of value in a short, sweet development cycle. \"Peak for me has kind of proved that there are definitely different, but maybe better ways to make games,\" Kaman told Game File. \"My prescription is: don’t spend three years. Don’t toil away on the things that don’t really matter. Like, figure out what your game’s about and focus on that.\" He added that \"peop…",

While Baldur's Gate 3 is easily the studio's best in terms of sheer fidelity, Divinity: Original Sin 2 had a bit more personality—cannibal elves, playable skeleton versions of each race, and so on. Larian said in a Reddit AMA Friday that the upcoming Divinity game should have the best character creation in the series. \"We are planning to have an even better one [than Baldur's Gate 3]! More colors, more options, more control,\" commented Alena Dubrovina, Divinity's art director in response to a question from Suspicious_Force_890. Redditors quickly retorted with all sorts of requests for sliders, body types, and customizable origin characters. I understand their pain. I shudder to think about how much of my playtime in Baldur's Gate 3, which is several hundred hours to begin with, was spent in the character creator alone.

This stems from a realisation that there is a ceiling to how much you can do on PC and console when you are perceived as a mobile-first game, and that you make compromises both in product design and go-to-market strategies when mobile is your lead platform.\" The trigger for this was Monument Valley 3, which initially came out exclusively on Netflix, being removed from the service a mere half a year after launch. \"After working with Netflix for a few years developing Monument Valley 3, the game launched in December 2024 with a strong marketing campaign behind it,\" she said, \"and six months later they told us they wanted to take it off the service.

Where things break down is, you don't seem to realize or recognize that there's a lot of other people out there and they all want different things.

An example he gives in the video is RPG romance. Whether you loved or hated how horny Baldur's Gate 3 was, it's clear that romanceable party companions are as popular as they are polarizing—and Cain said he's been pressured to include them even though they aren't to his taste.

As Gamesradar noted in its report on this, there's a video on YouTube where games marketing consultant Chris Zukowski talks about Valve's coveted \"chocolate tier\": a special class of studios that, once they get up to around $800,000 in annual revenue, receive a box of fancy chocolates as a gift from Valve at the end of the year. That Gamesradar article mentions an interview Game File (readers may encounter a paywall) conducted with Peak developer Aggro Crab. Co-founder Nick Kaman confirmed Aggro Crab has been itching to join the chocolate-chowing inner circle since it released Another Crab's Treasure , its most successful game before Peak. The team didn't receive a gift from Valve in 2024 despite pulling in the right amount of cash from that game, which stung; when Kaman emailed Valve about it, he got an apology.

That being said, I have bad news, #SlorkNation: Valve has melted Slork's wet, slippery body into Sunday dinner. Let me back up. Slork was a hero concept first accessible via console commands in Deadlock's private test. He was later added to the hero labs, a feature where characters with placeholder art could be used to queue up for normal games during scheduled hours, assuming you had a certain number of games under your belt. At this point, Slork had been renamed to the decidedly less hilarious Fathom. Deadlock has spent the last year shifting forms like the MOBA version of an Animorph, and the hero labs mode was removed as the game became increasingly polished and all play was subsumed into a single ranked queue. Four of the eight hero labs characters were added to Deadlock's core roster permanently. The others, including Fathom, were simply removed.

    "body": "When Valorant launched back in 2020, it was pitched as Counter-Strike with added superpowers, a combination that proved irresistible for shooter expert Morgan Park in PC Gamer's Valorant review . Over the last few years, however, the emphasis has gradually shifted to the point where Valorant has turned into superpowers with added Counter-Strike. This problem came to a head last year, with Riot promising to cut back on supplementary utility powers to reorient Valorant back around gunplay. This initiative is set to continue through 2026, with Valorant's latest patch introducing a new gun as Riot promises more extensive weapon reworks in the future. That new gun is called the Bandit, a semiautomatic pistol designed to fill the gap between the silenced Ghost and Valorant's high-powered revolver, the Sheriff. The Bandit gives players a higher rate of fire than the Sheriff and superior damage compared to the Ghost, able to deal instant kills on headshots against lightly armoured players. Riot believes this should add some extra spice to those early, pistol-heavy rounds. While the Bandit's addition is the only major weapon change in the update, Riot says it's indicative of the studio's b…",

Digital Anvil's third-person space-sim was conceived by Roberts in the late nineties. But after blasting through both Freelancer's budget and its planned two-and-a-half-year development cycle, Digital Anvil was acquired by Microsoft. Roberts left the company shortly after the buyout—though he remained involved with Freelancer as a creative consultant. Freelancer eventually released in 2003, more than three years later than originally planned. Its cinematic, arcade space combat was generally well liked. But the game was also criticised for being simplistic compared to other space sims—a consequence of Microsoft scaling down the project following their acquisition of Digital Anvil. There's always been a cohort of fans who have wondered what Freelancer might have looked like if Roberts realised his initial vision. Now, a subset of that cohort has just released its own, unofficial sequel to Freelancer, developed over a timeframe that makes the original game's creation look rapid by comparison.

For a quick definition, I think \"save scumming\" is best understood as using a game's save/load feature for anything other than quitting the game and coming back later, or continuing from a game over⁠—no moral judgement here, mind you, just an observation of our tendencies. The incentive to save scum could be argued to be a design failure, or merely a natural function of games as wish fulfillment.

Blizzard calls it The Tower and it's coming in a patch on January 12 as a beta mode that promises to improve over time. It's basically a multi-level dungeon where you slay monsters for a high score, leveraging both speed and power to clear your way to a final boss. Diablo 3 players will recognize this format as an updated version of Greater Rifts, a super endgame mode for players who are pretty much done perfecting their builds. To even the playing field, there are pylons scattered throughout The Tower that give you a big boost in damage when you destroy them. We won't know until it comes out if they're worth playing around, but I think it's Blizzard's way of giving less-than-optimal builds a chance to compete with people who adhere to the meta.
