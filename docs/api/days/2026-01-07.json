I got back into Arc Raiders this week expecting disappointment. After a nice long break from PvP games in December, it felt inevitable that the unlikely chill that defined Arc Raiders' community at launch would have eroded to more cynical, typical skirmishes over two months later. Surely as a larger pile of peaceful players checked off their final quests, cultivated stockpiles of valuables, or reset their progress altogether, they would turn to ruthless PvP as a means for variety.

Does he think it's in a good place? Does it seem particularly interesting or innovative to him as a space? \"No, I don't think it is,\" said Blow. \"And I'm not sure why, because I do feel like there are quite a few really good games in the past that people could look at, if they're sitting down and making a puzzle game… there's enough games that have done really interesting things that you should be able to look at them and, really, go from there, but I don't feel like people do.\" The way Blow sees it, too many puzzle games focus on pure difficulty at the expense of tying their puzzles into something broader—some kind of overarching theme…",

    "body": "I'm not going to lie to you, SSD pricing is pretty dire right now due to the memory apocalypse. As such, the end of 2025 was all doom and gloom about how we may not see sensibly priced storage for who knows how long—even Micron killed off its own Crucial brand, which had provided some of the best SSDs for gaming previously. And yet, a Micron-made SSD survives in 2026. The company has just announced the Micron 3610 NVMe SSD , which it bills as \"the industry’s first PCIe Gen5 QLC client SSD, powered by Micron G9 NAND.\" This release suggests that not only is Micron keeping at least a toe in the consumer market despite what was implied mere weeks ago , but that the company may even help pave the way back to reasonable storage pricing. Historically, QLC isn't what you want anywhere near your SSD, due to its high bits per cell leading to sluggish performance and questionable reliability. But times are changing; last year, SK Hynix introduced 321-layer QLC flash memory chips that boasted 100% faster transfer speeds and up to 56% greater write performance than earlier QLC memory. Long story short, the greater NAND density afforded by QLC tech packing in the layers should eventually mean c…",

Huang says that is a possibility, and \"we could also bring the latest generation AI technology to the previous generation GPUs, and that will require a fair amount of engineering, but it's also within the realm of possibility. I'll go back and take a look at this. It's a good idea.\" AI technology here refers to techniques like DLSS, which renders games at a lower resolution and upscales them with the help of AI. It also refers to frame generation, which uses AI image generation and interpolation to create new 'fake' frames in between 'real' rendered ones. When the RTX 50 series launched, it came with MFG (Multi Frame Generation), which adds three frames for every one 'real' frame. Just this week , it was announced that figure will go all the way up …",

In a chat with The Game Business (via Eurogamer ), Baker said he's not scared of the tech, and suggested that when it all shakes out, a big impact of AI could be to renew people's interest in human-made art over machine-generated \"content\". \"AI can create content, but it cannot create art.

It's grim out there. And then there's Embark Studios, which has used AI in both The Finals and its latest and greatest hit, Arc Raiders . Both prominently feature AI voices, for example, which has once again sparked debate over the ethics of using AI to generate assets for games that used to be created individually by people, whether artists or voice actors. Perhaps to help clear the air, in a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund expressed, \"I think people have misconceptions about what [AI] means.

That said, PC gaming wasn't entirely ignored, as DLSS 4.5 was ninja-launched with the promise of '4K 240 Hz path traced gaming'. However, DLSS is still AI-based and in a Q&A session with members of the press, CEO Jensen Huang made it clear that artificial intelligence isn't just for improving performance, it's how graphics needs to be done in the future. This much we already know, as Nvidia banged its neural rendering drum starting at last year's CES and then throughout 2025, and it wasn't the only graphics company to do so. Microsoft announced the addition of cooperative vectors to Direct3D, which is pretty much required to implement neural rendering in games, and AMD's FSR Redstone is as AI-based as anything from Intel and Nvidia. So, when PC World's Adam Patrick Murray asked Huang, \"Is the RTX 5090 the fastest GPU that gamers will ever see in traditional rasterization? And what does an AI gaming GPU look like in the future?\", it wasn't surprising that Nvidia's co-founder avoided the first question entirely and skipped straight to the topic of AI. \"I think that the answer is hard to predict…",

At first, I thought it wasn't worth the investment , back before Embark revealed all the details about what we were getting, but once it announced the $5 million for five skill points and the unique skin, I came around to the idea of Presitiging despite a lot of community grumbling . Embark definitely should've announced the details sooner, but at least we all know in advance this season, so it's easier to grind that five mil if you feel inclined. Like many, I didn't have enough cash or time to get all five skill points (I only got three), but I wanted to experience the Expedition first hand. So I packed off my Raider, retired them to a nice farm upstate, and definitely didn't feel bad about effectively sending them to the glue factory for some tasty benefits.

The game's lead game designer Michel Nohra confesses that they might've gone a little astray, there, per an interview with Edge magazine for Issue 419 (thanks, Gamesradar ): \"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now.\" See, while it's a safe assumption that Clair Obscur lets you keep playing after the credits roll, it's also a safe assumption that you're meant to do a little exploring first—more than that, Nohra explains, most players keep the final boss as a motivating carrot on the end of a stick: \"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content.

The earbuds feature a \"breakthrough hybrid five-driver acoustic system paired with a sophisticated three-way electronic crossover.\" That crossover refers to a 10 mm dynamic driver, a 6 mm planar driver, dual balanced armatures, and a \"micro-planar tweeter.\" Presumably the whole \"three-way\" thing is excluding the latter tweeter, as that's just more planar gubbins. So, there's a mix of dynamic, planar, and dual balanced armatures here. We've seen plenty of triple-driver earbuds before, but not so many that are specifically mixing planar with dynamic. This combination is probably what helps the price stay so \"low\", as these are \"set to launch this Spring at $200.\" That's expensive, of course, but it's hardly the, err, $1,300 of the fully Planar Audeze Euclid .

There's also an X account that tracks them , cataloguing them via a website called is.xiv.up.

Peppered with bullet holes? Enjoy a crisp 10 frames-a-second, no matter your monitor and GPU. Which is all quite amusing, I reckon, but I think the part that most piques my interest is the game's upgrade system. There are new guns that do more damage and churn out more shots per second, sure, but it looks like the meat of the game's upgrades revolve around finding new and exciting ways to break the whole thing. Want more frames, and thereby more health? Try swapping out your 3D-modelled gun for a 2D sprite, try hacking apart the level geometry, try futzing with the whole thing so much you eventually break the game. It genuinely seems quite clever. For instance, one of the upgrades visible in the game's promo bumpf amps up your frames by 10 fps. How? By yanking out all the columns in the game's map, effectively obliterating most—perhaps all…",

It's called SmartPowerHDR. It works by analysing each frame's peak brightness in real-time, sending that data to the panel's Timing Controller (TCON), which then optimises the voltage sent to the panel based on how many pixels are active on-screen. More or less, it's adapting the voltage depending on what the screen displays. Today's HDR modes apply a fixed voltage. \"Traditional HDR modes remain locked at maximum brightness, resulting in excessive power usage even in standard scenarios,\" the press release reads. \"As a result, many laptops default to SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) mode despite the color and brightness advantages of HDR.\" The benefit, as reported by the two companies, is around a 22% power saving in general usage with SmartPowerHDR, or around a 17% reduction during HDR content. True HDR content is going to request a higher voltage more often, such as a game with HDR support. Whereas things like web browsing, finding files or typing in documents don't really need …",

Don't get me wrong, the mosaic mirrored panels are very snazzy but perhaps a little too attention-grabbing for any room I could realistically picture it in. With a base measuring 840 mm by 691 mm plus a height of 912 mm, it's not just these odd angles that present a practical placement challenge either. Buckle up, because the InWin Aeon PC case possesses one of the most extra opening mechanisms I've yet seen . First, you need to trigger the opening mechanism by swiping an RFID card across the PC case's base. Then, the case's back opens and is gently lowered to lie flat via a hydraulic mechanism. This is meant to afford easy hardware installation but it's a whole lot of fanfare just to open your PC case—Not to mention additional potential points of failure.

There are no wires in StarRupture, but all rails and floor pieces conduct electricity. Ideally, then, your base won't have any dirt visible by the end as you'll cover it all with walkways and machines to daisy-chain power.

The event itself was a two-hour long AI-athon, with very little let up. Oh, there were plenty of star guest speakers. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang turned up to talk about, you guessed it, AI innovations. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su, pretty much the same. AI Gigafactorys were revealed . An oddly-named AI assistant was given its first outing. But for us PC gamers, we mostly had to make do with a brief mention of... this FIFA-themed Lenovo Legion Pro 7i . Hey, I get it. AI is a big deal these days, and not every event needs to cater to those of us that prefer to use our machines primarily as gaming devices. Still, it'd be nice to get something more than what appears to be a pre-existing gaming laptop with a sports theme, but I'll work with what we've got.

Instead, they're in malfunctioning T-45 power armor (thanks, Bud), fighting on the Alaskan Front with sparks shooting out of their limbs. Coop radios in to complain about their armor and request a return to base. When that's denied he creatively reinterprets his orders to send Charlie back, promising he'll be right behind. As soon as he's alone though, Coop hears mysterious growling coming from the other side of some mysterious wreckage. We're finally going to see a living deathclaw. Walton Goggins spends a lot of time as Coop reacting to things that are shocking and it's a credit to his acting that, even after so many episodes of seeing him be surprised by awful stuff, he really sells the deathclaw as uniquely scary.

On the left was a monitor without G-Sync Pulsar, and it looked fine.

(Sony applied for the patent in 2023; these things take time.) The patent proposes an in-game interface that accepts \"natural language queries\" to identify which bit of the game you're stuck on, and then can either show you how to overcome the obstacle or take over and do it for you. I guess via possession? The \"ghost character\" who provides \"ghost assistance\" will be based on footage of other players, presumably scraped from YouTube by AI. There's already a Game Help feature on Playstation 5 that can bring up relevant videos when you're stuck, and this seems like a less jarring implementation of that. As far as throwing AI at videogames goes, it sounds pretty inoffensive to me. It's not costing anyone their job or, you know, devaluing the connection between artist and audience. If it means there's one less reason to splatter yellow paint telling us where to go all over videogames, this seems like a good thing. Of course, that's not how gamers have responded.

Launched at CES, this is actually Lenovo's second device to natively use SteamOS. The first was the superb Legion Go S , which just so happens to be the best handheld gaming PC you can buy right now. That said, the hardware inside is somewhat last-gen, and that's something the Legion Go 2 offers over the Go S. The newer model sports an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme , whereas the older device gets by with a Z1 Extreme. These are APUs—a single chip comprising a CPU and GPU—and while they both house eight processor cores (supporting 16 threads), the Z2 Extreme uses AMD's Zen 5 and 5c architectures (three of the former, five of the latter). However, handheld devices are rarely held back by their CPUs, as games are far more GPU-limited than anything else. That's another area where the Z2 Extreme edges over the Z1 Extreme: its GPU has 16 RDNA 3.5 compute units (CUs), whereas the older chip has 12 RDNA 3 CUs. …",

It's a respectable list, with a few familiar names both among the actors and the characters they'll be playing. Zip, Lara's tech guy introduced in Tomb Raider: Chronicles, will be played by Martin Bobb-Semple; Winston, the Croft family's long-suffering butler, will be played by Bill Paterson; Atlas de Mornay, Lara's uncle, will be played by Jason Isaacs. Having Uncle Atlas be played by the actor most famous as Lucius Malfoy in Harry Potter—though he deserves to be just as well-known for playing Field Marshal Zhukov in The Death of Stalin and Enver Gortash in Baldur's Gate 3—suggests he might turn out to not be a supportive family member.

In a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi , Embark founder Patrick Söderlund reflected on the decision, and said it was easier to cut against the grain of free-to-play after witnessing the success of other premium multiplayer games like Helldivers 2. \"It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like Helldivers and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'\" Söderlund said. \"We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game.\" Without ge…",

Fallout 4, Fallout: New Vegas, and even Fallout 3 and the original Fallouts have essentially doubled their daily concurrent players on Steam since Fallout Season 2 started airing on Prime Video in December. Via SteamDB , we can see that in the weeks leading up to the show's premiere in mid-December, Fallout 4 was typically averaging about 20,000 concurrent players, but as of Sunday that count had risen to over 40,000. Likewise, Fallout: New Vegas was pulling in roughly 8,000 concurrents a day, and that rose to nearly 20,000 last weekend.

In a new interview with Games Beat , Embark's CEO Patrick Söderlund went into some detail on how the studio built the game's maps, and the big surprise for me was how closely they hew to certain real world inspirations. \"[Dam Battlegrounds] is the second one we made,\" says Söderlund. \"To get the first iteration done probably takes weeks before it's playable but ugly and then it takes… I think we probably spent 6 months on this map to playtest it and make it playable.\" \"The real work is actually making sure the map plays well.

The E37T PCIe Gen5 controller may not sound like the sexiest hardware update, but I promise there's plenty about it that's at least eyebrow-raising. Basically, you can think of it as a great big step up from the Phison E31T, which features in our current budget favourite for the best PCIe 5.0 SSD for gaming , the Crucial P510 NVMe SSD . To make that short story a little longer, I'll borrow some of Phison's own words; the company touts the new E37T memory controller's ability \"to deliver competitive price-to-performance value for modern consumer workloads across notebooks and mobile devices.\" To cut through the marketing-speak, this memory controller should make PCIe 5.0 drives not only faster but just a little more affordable, too.
