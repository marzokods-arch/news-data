Phillippa Warr gave it an impressive score of 88 in PC Gamer's Heaven's Vault Review, stating it \"does a beautiful job of letting you unlock a language, and thus a dialogue of sorts, with the past, via a wonderfully engaging protagonist.\" Yet had Inkle's original plans come to fruition, Heaven's Vault would have been quite a different experience. This was revealed in a Bluesky post by Inkle's narrative director and writer Jon Ingold, where he stated that \"Heaven's Vault started out as a Doctor Who game\". Ingold revealed the full story in an interview with Eurogamer , explaining how Inkle was approached by multiple organisations about working with their licenses following the success of 80 Days . \"One of those was an approach from the BBC, who floated several different BBC properties for us to consider working on. As a lifetime Doctor Who fan, that was the one we jumped on.\" Inkle then spent roughly eight months working on a pitch called The Daedalus Ef…",

After listening to him suck up to Elon Musk on the Rushmore podcast (cheers TWIV ), however, it sounds like he might have lost his strong instincts. \"Elon truly would be the best owner of any game company,\" he said. \"No, he would. There's not a person who'd be more qualified to build and run a game company.\" Musk's videogame credentials largely amount to liking videogames. He might actually be quite good at Quake and Diablo 4 , too, though it's really hard to tell given his penchant for paying people to play for him. In January, he streamed some Path of Exile 2, but seemed confused by basic game mechanics, which would have been fine if he hadn't been boasting about his skills, or if he wasn't playing on a geared-up, high-level character.

I received the View 390 Air in its white variant for review. This being called 'Snow' and offering a suitably frosty finish across most parts of the case. Though there are a few colourways to choose from, including a delectable-sounding Butter Caramel (yellow) and, my personal favourite, Future Dusk (purple). Or just plain black if you're a bit boring. Upon opening the box, I had a feeling I might end up a little disappointed with the View 390 Air. The case doesn't make a good first impression, in large part thanks to the bag of loose screws hanging in the rear. This, I dare say, is the messiest bag of bolts ever called 'accessories' I've experienced with a PC case—a jangling selection of screws, zip-ties, and a roll of Velcro, looking like the world's worst party favour.

And they only had 30 employees at the company.\" Kotick didn't want to have to take the reins. \"We can't run your company,\" he told Notch.

The way Demonschool weaves old-school apocalyptic vibes with tactics-based combat brought out the beast. I devoured it in a matter of days, and it pulled off something no other RPG has managed before: make me fall in love with the ways of the isometric grid. Faye is very much your typical spunky, slightly boisterous heroine (hi that's me), a self-proclaimed demon hunter on her way to enroll in a school on the mysterious Hemsk Island (god I wish that was me). Why? Because the apocalypse is coming, of course, and the island promises to be a verifiable hub of demon activity. And I mean, hey, she's right.

    "body": "Overwatch 2 has finally confirmed who Hero 45 is going to be, and the statue in Stadium's Colosseo map was right: the next hero will be a female gladiator called Vendetta who goes by the name of La Lupa, The Wolf. Revealed in the Vendetta hero trailer , La Lupa shows off a couple of cool tricks that'll likely be part of her kit. While fighting a huge omnic in the Colosseo in front of a rowdy crowd, La Lupa uses her giant sword to take it down. She has a spin attack that launches an energy projectile, pierces its husk with a charged-up sword, and performs what looks like an ultimate as she cuts the omnic in half with a huge energy slash. But most of her attacks are melee, meaning this'll likely be her primary attack. Vendetta is unfortunately a DPS hero, which is great for DPS players who want another melee hero to master, but I'm still convinced that she should've been a Tank . Heroes like Junker Queen and Doomfist have already proved that tanks don't necessarily need to be huge or have shields, as long as they can make and hold space, and it seems like La Lupa would be able to do this. But the most interesting aspect of this hero was her brief flashback midway through the reveal …",

There are quite a few items to be had in this event, but the best by far is the Deadline mine. It first caught my eye as it is a pink, epic rarity item, but I hadn't paid it any more attention until I saw just how effective it is against arcs. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Over the last few days, I've seen videos of this mine one-shot a Bastion , kill a Leaper, and be integral in the fight against the Queen arc. It's truly the best item in the game right now for killing arcs. YouTuber Damood brought eight Deadline mines to his fight against the Queen arc and, alongside the help of other raiders and the electromagnetic cloak, managed to use them to take the Queen down in under 10 minutes, an impressive feat. While another player, LifelessOne, decided to see what would happen if they put a Deadline on a Leaper: \"The new mine is… strong.\" I'm just impressed they ma…",

However, the days of this vastly preferable third option may be numbered.

Online privacy nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation recently criticised this strategy, taking aim at Wisconsin's bill in particular, saying that blocking the use of VPNs is \"going to be a disaster for everyone.\" The foundation argues that due to lawmakers misunderstanding how the location-masking technology works, \"Websites subject to this proposed law are left with this choice: either cease operation in Wisconsin, or block all VPN users, everywhere, just to avoid legal liability in the state.

    "summary": "Fancy an OLED monitor this Black Friday?",
    "body": "OLED PC monitor sales are on the up, according to data outfit Trendforce . Compared to last year, sales are up by fully 65%. That's comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the same period in 2024. If you instead put this quarter up against the previous quarter in 2025, sales of OLED monitors are up 12%, with a grand total of 644,000 units. Trendforce is predicting 2.62 million units, total, for 2025 and over 80% growth versus 2024. For context, another analyst firm, IDC, is forecasting over 130 million overall PC monitor sales of all types for 2025 and around 25 million specifically gaming monitor sales this year. That latter figure is probably the most relevant. Currently, the vast majority of OLED monitors are aimed at gaming, with just a handful of models either engineered for content creation and other professional use or the premium consumer segment. That means OLED is predicted to have roughly 10% of the PC gaming monitor market in 2025. Incidentally, if you're wondering who the big noises in OLED monitors are, according to Trendforce, Asus has taken over the top spot from Samsung, with 21.9% market share in its latest figures. OLED TVs still make monitors seem pricey. (Ima…",

On that front, Valve explains that the company's upcoming machine is actually \"equal or better\" than 70% of Steam gamers' systems. Talking on YouTube channel Adam Savage's Tested, a Valve engineer said , \"Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at, in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home.

To be fair, he's got receipts. Navok summons the recent examples of Arc Raiders and the Roblox game Steal a Brainrot to back up his points. Arc Raiders, of course, makes prominent use of AI voices, which did little to stop it peaking at 480,000 concurrent players last weekend. Steal a Brainrot, meanwhile, \"had 30m concurrents or approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents,\" says Navok, \"and is named after/based on AI slop characters.

However, in the longer Gift FAQ, Epic clarifies that \"you can use your Epic Rewards balance toward a gift purchase\" which makes a lot more sense. As for what you can gift friends on Epic, the answer is most items on the store, but not everything. The exceptions are free games (for obvious reasons) pre-purchase offers, subscriptions, and in-game currency or other consumable items.

As discovered on the game's subreddit by user zero-sumgames (who collated the info, alongside u/serversamwinchester and u/bog_waif ), whether or not Invisigal stays a hero or becomes a villain is dependent on a modifier in the game's code called the \"RobertMentorCounter\" system, or RMC.

The news was shared to Bluesky by Heineman's friend, Heidi McDonald , while the most recent post on Heineman's GoFundMe is a goodbye message stating that her health was rapidly deteriorating, and she was entering palliative care. Heineman was 62, and the GoFundMe will remain live to help her family make final arrangements. Born in 1963, Heineman initially made a mark on the industry by winning a national Space Invaders tournament in 1980 in New York, becoming the first formally recognized US champion of any videogame. She went on to have a far-reaching career, being credited on 67 games according to MobyGames . Heineman co-founded Interplay in 1983 alongside Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell. The developer and publisher was the source of many foundational PC games, including Wasteland, Fallout, and Baldur's Gate. Heineman designed and programmed a number of games at Interplay, with her most prominent design credit being The Bard's Tale 3: Thief of Fate. Heineman's friend and colleague from Interplay, Brian Fargo, shared a remembrance of the developer on X. \"Rebecca Heineman sadly passed a…",

And yet, here we all are again, charging down the field with renewed gusto following Valve's big hardware announcements . Given how many times we've ended up flat on our backs behind an unkicked football, I cringe to say this, but it's not unreasonable to believe that a new Half-Life game will be announced within the next year or so. The recent excitement on the Half-Life subreddit is partially due to misunderstandings (reporter Jason Schreier does not in fact have insider information about an imminent announcement), but is at least somewhat justified by the facts: The idea that Valve might release a new Half-Life game is no longer in the realm of pure imagination, as it put out the VR-only Half-Life: Alyx in 2020 The Half-Life: Alyx ending (spoilers) very much leaves the door open for future Half-Life games Five years is enough time to have made a new Half-Life game (although barely,…",

Some crash and burn on day one while others are kept alive by players, modders, and community creators long after they might have otherwise slipped away. A few games, however, have lived on for decades, kept alive not just by passionate fans but by developers who have never thrown in the towel or dusted off their hands and said \"done.\" These games have, against all odds, managed to withstand the test of time. They're still being worked on after 20, 30, even 40(!) years. When we first wrote a version of this list in 2018, all of the games we included had been updated that year. Amazingly, seven years later they're all still alive, even if updates are a bit fewer and farther between. But almost every entry on this updated list has either been updated in 2025, or in the last couple years, with its development history making us pretty sure they'll still see another patch in the second half of this decade.

I love it so much. Demon King producer Andy Han got me in touch with Daifuku so I could find out how you make a game that sounds like literal hell. The answer, it seems, is some incredibly creative (and occasionally painful) sample work. \"Making the sounds was basically just layering, spectrally morphing and manipulating samples until I found something I thought sounded cool,\" Daifuku said. \"Most of the sounds I made were simply happy accidents, such as the Nure-onna gasping before she feeds, which was me accidentally eating very stale banana chips.\" Unfortunately, the exact scene Daifuku is referencing is not on YouTube, but I'm pretty sure you can hear the gasp in question (followed by some stomach-churning slurping) at the 57-second mark of this trailer for Labyrinth of the Demon King. \"I thought…",

The filing claims Kim went so far as to consult with AI to figure a way out of paying, but even ChatGPT told him he was probably stuck. The legal dispute between Krafton and Subnautica designer and director Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire has been dragging on since July, when all three very suddenly left their positions . While the departures were initially presented as amicable, it quickly became clear that it was anything but. Legal action was filed by both sides and it's gotten very messy: Krafton initially said the three were fired because of the state of Subnautica 2 and their insistence on releasing it before it was ready, but in September it seemed to drop that claim in favor of focusing on allegations the founders had \"deceived\" Krafton , including that they'd downloaded confidential informatio…",

Notorious for showing up right after a controversial balance patch last year , the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur has been released from its cage and it might be the reason WoW Tokens are currently sold out in the UK. The mount was extraordinarily popular last time. Players were crowding the streets with it, which led some other players to despair as this absurdly priced microtransaction seemingly got more attention than a botched patch. That's not exactly the case this time, but there are still people who hate that it even exists. Most of the fervor for the dinosaur mount is because it comes with an auction house and mailbox attached to it, unlike almost every other mount in the game.

The problem is they keep getting cancelled before anyone gets to see them. \"People often ask me why I don't make a sequel to Nier, or why I'm not working, but that's because I've had so many projects that have been discontinued lately,\" Yoko said via machine translation. \"Even though I was working, it wasn't released to the public.

Joseph O'Connor, now 26 years old, hijacked over 130 accounts, including those of Apple, Uber, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Kanye West. Alongside other hackers, three of whom have been charged, they then impersonated the companies / individuals in question and used the accounts to promote a classic \"double your money\" scam. The hijacked accounts would send tweets asking followers to send Bitcoin to digital wallets, promising that the money would be doubled and returned. An estimated 350 million Twitter users viewed these dodgy tweets and, over 15-16 July 2020, a total of 426 transfers totalling 12.86 Bitcoin was made to the wallets. This would have been worth around $110,000 in 2020: now the value would be more like $1.2 million. The hack itself, as they often are, was more down to social engineering than cyber genius.

    "body": "Silent Hill f recently received a big update that adds a casual difficulty, speeds up NG+ runs, and reduces the number of areas where players are forced to engage with combat. The patch seems like a sensible response to some general criticisms of the acclaimed horror revival. But fans of the series are convinced that the update originated from a much more specific source—the game's lead actor. Japanese actor and model Konatsu Kato lends her voice and likeness to protagonist Shimizu Hinako in Silent Hill f. But Kato has also been livestreaming her own playthrough of the game since October, fulfilling a promise she made to fans earlier in the month. Her streams have since gone viral, with the VODs of her streams receiving millions of views on YouTube . As reported by Automaton Media, part of the reason behind the popularity of Kato's streams is her specific journey with the game. More than just being about her reactions and opinions, Kato is not a regular gamer, so Silent Hill f has proved a bit of a baptism of fire for her. Viewers have watched her contend with the game and its peculiar combat system in real-time, leading to events such as her encounter with one particular monster …",

Even if you're a gigachad who's unruffled about finding a Leddy, picking it up in the tutorial could net you a cool two million rubles to kickstart the game. It's good enough that when I found it for myself during my tutorial for the game's PvP mode, I immediately reset my PvE account and went to grab it for myself. So, how do you get said LEDX? If you're about to start the Escape From Tarkov tutorial, or you are considering wiping your account just to grab it, here's what you need to do, plus some other handy items to grab during the tutorial: 1. Go through the tutorial (Image credit: Battlestate Games) You'll start the tutorial by dusting yourself off in the Terragroup Building in Ground Zero.

Patch 1.7 is a doozy—you can tell because it's one of those patches a developer puts out a video to mark—and it's out now. There are a few significant tweaks here, but the things that stand out to me are: yet more fixes for the game's A-Life system and a whole new difficulty. That's in descending order of importance, so far as I'm concerned. The A-Life fixes sound a lot more interesting than GSC's prosaic \"Fixes and improvements to the A-Life system\" makes it sound. If you're not familiar, A-Life is the name GSC gives to the systems in all its Stalker games that, more or less, let the games' beasts and NPCs pursue independent lives and objectives. It's always kind of an illusion, but it's an illusion that many felt was especially lacking in Stalker 2 at launch. The big change today? \"Factions can expand control over new territories.\" Which, let me be the first to say: hell yeah. \"This means they may also lose control over their lands if they fail to defend them.

Probably the biggest tribute I can pay Phasmophobia, though, is that it's still on my SSD. I don't play it all the time, but it's one of those games where someone suggests it as a palate-cleanser after some sweaty PVP, and everyone's instantly on-board. It even helps to return infrequently, because more often than not Kinetic's added or tweaked something to make it feel new. The Steam reviews tell their own story: approximately 340,000 of them have it sitting pretty at \" overwhelmingly positive .\" Kinetic's clearly doing something right and, at the recent launch event for a comprehensive rework of Nell's Diner , CEO Daniel Knight and art director Corey Dixon told PCGN that dodging the usual live service trappings is kinda the point. \"[Live service] has definitely changed players' expect…",
