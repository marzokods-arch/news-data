    "body": "The Vampire Survivors-like Megabonk is one of the big indie hits of the year, selling a million copies in just two weeks and earning a nomination for best debut indie game in The Game Awards 2025 . That sort of exposure is a big deal, especially for a small indie release, but developer vedinad said they're withdrawing from the show for one simple and very understandable reason: Megabonk isn't actually their first game. \"It's an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately I don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game',\" vedinad wrote on X (via Kotaku). \"I've made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game. \"I really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category. You should vote for another one of the amazing debut titles, they are all amazing games!\" Numerous replies credit vedinad—who signed off the message as John Megabonk—for their honesty, but one or two invoked memories of Dave the Diver , which was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards in 2023. Dave the Diver looks and plays like an indie game, but was developed by Mintrocket, a division of…",

    "body": "You may recall the sad case of Planet Centauri, an indie 2D sandbox game that spent more than a decade in development, amassed well over 130,000 wishlists, and then struggled to gain traction when the 1.0 release happened earlier this year because a bug in Steam prevented the it's out announcement email from being sent to people who'd added it to their wishlists. Ouch. Honest mistake, though, and to Valve's credit it offered developer Permadeath a small makeup: an opportunity to spotlight Planet Centauri as one of Steam's Daily Deals, \"as a way to help make up for lost visibility.\" The studio has since moved on to other things, because there really wasn't any choice in the matter, but despite some misgivings it did eventually decide to take Valve up on the offer. So, as reported by Polygon , a little over a month ago Permadeath signed up for the Daily Deal spotlight on one of the dates offered by Valve: November 12. November 12, as it turned out, was a very big day—but not for Planet Centauri. Because November 12 was the day Valve revealed the Steam Machine , Steam Frame , and Steam Controller to the world, a move that completely dominated the videogaming news scene for days and b…",

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. Project Misriah: Halo Ports, a collection of Counter-Strike 2 custom maps that recreate classic Halo 3 multiplayer in Valve's freshly rebooted FPS, is so good that it's frustrating. Released yesterday on the CS2 workshop by mappers Froddoyo, Lydran, and ORB-NRG, Project Misriah is a lot more than a map pack containing faithful recreations of Homefront, High Ground, and Ghost Town. The mod also recreates the mechanics of Halo 3 as closely as possible within Valve's toolset, replacing most of the base game's arsenal with Halo guns spanning the series, tweaking ballistics so you're actually accurate while moving (a wild concept), lowering gravity, raising the time-to-kill, and even adding original sound effects and Jeff Steitzer's iconic announcer lines. It's delightful, evocative of the source material, and legitimately fun. I played some CTF and Slayer with bots on Ghost Town (the former works by turning the hostage into a flag) and m…",

A quick recap: Baldur's Gate 3 ran the board on Game of the Year Awards in 2023, taking the big crown (and numerous other laurels) in the Steam Awards, The Game Awards, and the Golden Joysticks.

It got to the point where Larian boss Swen Vincke was almost asking the world to please stop giving us awards , because the seemingly endless stream of accolades meant the development team \"can't get closure. And you want to have closure at the end of a project.\" And then a month after that Baldur's Gate 3 won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work, because sure, why not.

The asset in question is a 3D model of plastic explosive that appears in the new trailer. Recognising the asset, McFarlane took to social media to address the issue: \"Hey Delta Force, thank you for being huge Rust fans. Please remove our assets,\" McFarlane posted on X (via Insider Gaming ). \"If you wanted to collab, you should have reached out.\" In a follow-up post, McFarlane linked to an ArtStation page showing the asset, which he says was made \"fully in-house\" by Facepunch's lead weapon and prop artist Thomas Butters, who also goes by Pilgrim. It looks virtually identical to the asset seen in the trailer, though this doesn't necessarily mean it is the same asset.

Well, they said it was a lot of stuff to do with the endings and your choices across the series not mattering that much. I know better, though. In their heart of hearts, in the deep, festering reaches of their collective subconscious, the gamers yearned for the lifts. The first Mass Effect was beloved. It was also a game about standing in a lot of lifts. These things are not unconnected. Now, a doughty modder has restored the third Mass Effect (in its Legendary Edition form) to the pristine condition of its predecessor. Glorious Elevators (LE3) comes from Linkenski, who also put in the work to restore the original setup for ME1's Saren fights to the Legendary Edition and created, ah, Miranda Buttfarts Restored . \"Glorious Elevators return to Mass Effect beyond the first game,\" declares our modder. \"Originally Mass Effect 3 actually had a working elevator right …",

Still, as temperatures drop, and heating bills soar, you can't blame a girl for wanting to get a bit creative about heating her space—though I think I'd have to draw the line at welcoming a mini data centre into my home. Well, according to the BBC , that's one of the options being offered as part of a pilot scheme in the UK. As part of the project, participants Terrence and Lesley Bridges replaced their gas boiler with the mini data centre in question and claim their bills have dropped from £375 a month (almost $500) to only £40 a month (about $50). The kicker? The data centre, which comprises 500 teeny tiny Raspberry Pi computers, is still compact enough to fit inside their outdoor shed. Terrence Bridges is pleased with the swap, citing both the savings made and the device's impressive heat output… as well as another line of reasoning that personally gives me pause. He told the BBC, \"I think it's fantastic because it's eco-friendly. We're not burning any gases, so it's green—it's environmentally friendly.\" Cal…",

So far, we haven't seen any dramatic increases in PC system prices, but as Black Friday 2025 hoves into view, the question is for how much longer will that remain the case? Trendforce recently downgraded its expectations for 2025 from 1.7% growth for the overall PC market to -2.4% shrinkage. For smartphones, Trendforce revised its figures from 0.1% down to -2%. According to Hankyung, memory accounts for 25% of the cost of AI PCs and 18% of the cost of smartphones. Trendforce reportedly expects laptop prices to rise by five to 15% on account of the 75% increase in RAM module prices that we've already seen. Presumably if memory prices go yet higher, retail system prices will follow. Hankyung also notes that the price of 16 Gb DDR5 chips more than doubled to $24.80 per unit in the month to November 18 on DRAMeXchange . In response, bigger players in the IT industry including Asus and Apple are said to be preemptively purchasing DRAM (and also NAND memory for SSDs), while also discontinuing low-margin products.…",

This was revealed in a Bluesky post by Inkle's narrative director and writer Jon Ingold, where he stated that \"Heaven's Vault started out as a Doctor Who game\".

Revealed in the Vendetta hero trailer , La Lupa shows off a couple of cool tricks that'll likely be part of her kit. While fighting a huge omnic in the Colosseo in front of a rowdy crowd, La Lupa uses her giant sword to take it down. She has a spin attack that launches an energy projectile, pierces its husk with a charged-up sword, and performs what looks like an ultimate as she cuts the omnic in half with a huge energy slash.

Vendetta is unfortunately a DPS hero, which is great for DPS players who want another melee hero to master, but I'm still convinced that she should've been a Tank . Heroes like Junker Queen and Doomfist have already proved that tanks don't necessarily need to be huge or have shields, as long as they can make and hold space, and it seems like La Lupa would be able to do this.

Online privacy nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation recently criticised this strategy, taking aim at Wisconsin's bill in particular, saying that blocking the use of VPNs is \"going to be a disaster for everyone.\" The foundation argues that due to lawmakers misunderstanding how the location-masking technology works, \"Websites subject to this proposed law are left with this choice: either cease operation in Wisconsin, or block all VPN users, everywhere, just to avoid legal liability in the state.

That's comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the same period in 2024. If you instead put this quarter up against the previous quarter in 2025, sales of OLED monitors are up 12%, with a grand total of 644,000 units. Trendforce is predicting 2.62 million units, total, for 2025 and over 80% growth versus 2024. For context, another analyst firm, IDC, is forecasting over 130 million overall PC monitor sales of all types for 2025 and around 25 million specifically gaming monitor sales this year. That latter figure is probably the most relevant. Currently, the vast majority of OLED monitors are aimed at gaming, with just a handful of models either engineered for content creation and other professional use or the premium consumer segment. That means OLED is predicted to have roughly 10% of the PC gaming monitor market in 2025. Incidentally, if you're wondering who the big noises in OLED monitors are, according to Trendforce, Asus has taken over the top spot from Samsung, with 21.9% market share in its latest figures.

When asked how the AI bubble bursting would affect Google Pichai tells the BBC the company would survive, but also that \"no company is going to be immune, including us.\" In an interview with the British news organisation Google's Sundar Pichai talks at length about this technology as we enter \"clearly the era of AI.\" Pichai has been the CEO of Google for over a decade now, and as such, he is one of the most influential voices in favour of the rise of generative AI tools. Google, alongside all its competitors, is committing a lot of time, money, and effort into the growth of AI. Pichai says, \"AI is dramatically increasing demand for energy\", adding that \"maybe four years ago, Google was spending less than 30 billion dollars per year. This year, that number is going to be over 90 billion dollars.\" With exponential growth comes the potential of that growth stopping suddenly, and the industries built around it collapsing in response.

On that front, Valve explains that the company's upcoming machine is actually \"equal or better\" than 70% of Steam gamers' systems. Talking on YouTube channel Adam Savage's Tested, a Valve engineer said , \"Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at, in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home. So that's also another way to, kind of, think about where we kind of arrived at that performance level [that they targeted]\" (via Notebookcheck ).

To be fair, he's got receipts. Navok summons the recent examples of Arc Raiders and the Roblox game Steal a Brainrot to back up his points. Arc Raiders, of course, makes prominent use of AI voices, which did little to stop it peaking at 480,000 concurrent players last weekend. Steal a Brainrot, meanwhile, \"had 30m concurrents or approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents,\" says Navok, \"and is named after/based on AI slop characters.

The post also says that \"recipients can use their Epic Rewards balance to redeem gifts\"—an odd phrasing that makes it sound like you'll need to use Reward points to redeem a gift you've been given. However, in the longer Gift FAQ, Epic clarifies that \"you can use your Epic Rewards balance toward a gift purchase\" which makes a lot more sense. As for what you can gift friends on Epic, the answer is most items on the store, but not everything. The exceptions are free games (for obvious reasons) pre-purchase offers, subscriptions, and in-game currency or other consumable items. Anyone who receives a gift on Epic has 14 days to claim it, somewhat shorter than the 30 days allowed by Steam.

    "body": "After two decades of Half-Life 3 rumors , each new burst of hope looks a lot like Charlie Brown once again getting set to kick a football. None of the suspicious lines of CS:GO code or yarn-webbed conspiracy board YouTube videos have actually preceded an announcement of the fabled Half-Life 2 sequel. And yet, here we all are again, charging down the field with renewed gusto following Valve's big hardware announcements . Given how many times we've ended up flat on our backs behind an unkicked football, I cringe to say this, but it's not unreasonable to believe that a new Half-Life game will be announced within the next year or so. The recent excitement on the Half-Life subreddit is partially due to misunderstandings (reporter Jason Schreier does not in fact have insider information about an imminent announcement), but is at least somewhat justified by the facts: The idea that Valve might release a new Half-Life game is no longer in the realm of pure imagination, as it put out the VR-only Half-Life: Alyx in 2020 The Half-Life: Alyx ending (spoilers) very much leaves the door open for future Half-Life games Five years is enough time to have made a new Half-Life game (although barely,…",

Some crash and burn on day one while others are kept alive by players, modders, and community creators long after they might have otherwise slipped away. A few games, however, have lived on for decades, kept alive not just by passionate fans but by developers who have never thrown in the towel or dusted off their hands and said \"done.\" These games have, against all odds, managed to withstand the test of time. They're still being worked on after 20, 30, even 40(!) years. When we first wrote a version of this list in 2018, all of the games we included had been updated that year. Amazingly, seven years later they're all still alive, even if updates are a bit fewer and farther between. But almost every entry on this updated list has either been updated in 2025, or in the last couple years, with its development history making us pretty sure they'll still see another patch in the second half of this decade. We've focused on games from the '80s and '90s with interesting and slightly lesser-known histories—it's not a complete list (shout out to Everquest, D…",

I love it so much. Demon King producer Andy Han got me in touch with Daifuku so I could find out how you make a game that sounds like literal hell. The answer, it seems, is some incredibly creative (and occasionally painful) sample work. \"Making the sounds was basically just layering, spectrally morphing and manipulating samples until I found something I thought sounded cool,\" Daifuku said. \"Most of the sounds I made were simply happy accidents, such as the Nure-onna gasping before she feeds, which was me accidentally eating very stale banana chips.\" Unfortunately, the exact scene Daifuku is referencing is not on YouTube, but I'm pretty sure you can hear the gasp in question (followed by some stomach-churning slurping) at the 57-second mark of this trailer for Labyrinth of the Demon King. \"I thought…",

The filing claims Kim went so far as to consult with AI to figure a way out of paying, but even ChatGPT told him he was probably stuck. The legal dispute between Krafton and Subnautica designer and director Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire has been dragging on since July, when all three very suddenly left their positions . While the departures were initially presented as amicable, it quickly became clear that it was anything but. Legal action was filed by both sides and it's gotten very messy: Krafton initially said the three were fired because of the state of Subnautica 2 and their insistence on releasing it before it was ready, but in September it seemed to drop that claim in favor of focusing on allegations the founders had \"deceived\" Krafton , including that they'd downloaded confidential informatio…",

Notorious for showing up right after a controversial balance patch last year , the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur has been released from its cage and it might be the reason WoW Tokens are currently sold out in the UK. The mount was extraordinarily popular last time. Players were crowding the streets with it, which led some other players to despair as this absurdly priced microtransaction seemingly got more attention than a botched patch. That's not exactly the case this time, but there are still people who hate that it even exists. Most of the fervor for the dinosaur mount is because it comes with an auction house and mailbox attached to it, unlike almost every other mount in the game.
