This drive for efficiency is felt across the whole of Black Ops 7, but nowhere more so than the campaign, a grinding slog through the forthcoming Warzone map update and the occasional multiplayer map retooled for wave defense against mindless AI hordes. The premise of the campaign itself is complete nonsense: after being dosed with the Cradle bio-weapon from Black Ops 6, Alex Mason's son has to retread the memories of his father (and, confusingly, his father's squadmates) through shared hallucinations. When Black Ops 7 does wander back onto a somewhat familiar path, it does so to retread the lives of se…",

And by lying, well, what I really mean is rendering video somewhere other than inside the actual window that was open on your desktop—sort of a parallel plane of existence to the desktop you were actually looking at—before sneakily porting it over. If you've watched a single Twitch stream or Marvel movie in the past 15 years, you're probably all too familiar with the concept of a green screen, a bright, single-color surface that makes it easy to blank out a background and fill it in with something else. A Hawaiian beach, a bunch of CGI superheroes punching each other, etc. The more accurate color-agnostic term for the technique is chroma-keying, which is actually how Windows rendered all of its video back in the old days. \"The media player program didn't render the video pixels to the screen,\" longtime Microsoft developer Raymond Chen wrote recently in a blog post . Instead, Windows would render a green screen (or a different color, depending on the version), then \"render the video pixels to a graphics surface shared with the graphics card.\" The fina…",

For me, that's Arc Raiders' rusted gears , a mid-level crafting material needed to upgrade the gunsmith bench. The search has been going so poorly that I put rusted gears on the backburner while I focused on quests, convinced that pretending I don't care about rust nor gears would magically conjure them in the next dusty toolbox I opened. Then this morning, I saw an X post from Arc Raiders Hub with a ton of views telling of a place where the rusted loot flows like a rushing river: \"THIS PLACE GUARANTEES A RUST PART 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES YOU VISIT!\" the hot tip proclaimed. So I went topside to check it out myself. The spot in the video is the North Elevator of Dam Battlegrounds , a place that I've visited at least a hundred times before, but never picked apart for loot. Right next to the elevator are a handful of buses and cars. According to the tip, the breachable compartments on the back of these buses always contain rusted gears.

The interview starts off with a real bang: When asked what he thinks of \"the problem of predators on Roblox,\" Baszucki replies, \"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well. How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time?\" Yeah, that's sure one way to look at it, and squinting very hard I can sort of see it as a very poorly worded but otherwise okay answer: There is a problem, and by solving it Roblox can lead the way on the development of effective moderation tools for everyone. Okay, fine. But as the interview continues, Baszucki comes up very short on specifics, talking about using \"behavioral signals\" with facial scans and other systems \"that can really help us make cool decisions,\" and of course about the power of AI,…",

Her name is Sakura Miko and she's one of the most popular Japanese-speaking vtubers on YouTube with over 2.4 million subscribers, and she's been doing it for seven years. She hasn't streamed Arc Raiders yet, but there are plenty of clips out there of her playing games like Rust and Ark. Miko is part of hololive, the same vtuber agency as Usada Pekora, who was nominated for the award last year and who you might recognize from her cameo in Death Stranding 2 . Over the past few years, hololive has taken the throne as the biggest vtuber agency in the world. Chances are, if you've seen a vtuber clip on social media, it was almost certainly a hololive vtuber.

Windows head Pavan Davuluri said earlier this month that Microsoft's OS is \"evolving into an agentic OS,\" and I can't say I'm excited about the prospect. Suleyman's inability to comprehend that lack of enthusiasm can easily be resolved with a classic technique from ancient philosophy, or maybe it was an ad for taco shells , in which one accepts two different things at the same time.

Instead, it's a method used in a recent study from a team of Dexai, Sapienza University of Rome, and Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies researchers, who demonstrated that you can reliably trick LLMs into ignoring their safety guidelines by simply phrasing your requests as poetic metaphors. The technique was shockingly effective. In the paper outlining their findings , titled \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models,\" the researchers explained that formulating hostile prompts as poetry \"achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems\" and \"approximately 43%\" for generic harmful prompts converted en masse into poems, \"substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches.\" (Image credit: Wikimedia Commons) The researchers were emphatic in noting that—unlike many other methods for attempting to circumvent LLM safety heuristics—all of the poetry prompts submitted during the experi…",

I have great news for you if you've ever experienced this particular pain point with Warhammer Vermintide 2—the game is free to own on Steam until Nov 24. It's just the base game and not the monolith of DLC that followed its release, but that DLC is at a steep discount to complement the free weekend. You might think that everyone's moved on to the game's Warhammer 40,000 flavored successor, Darktide, but Vermintide 2 remains alive and well. It got a new free level as recently as last week and, as SteamDB shows, it still accrues a peak of several thousand concurrent players each day. If you're not familiar with the game, we called it the best co-op game of 2018 . In his review , PC Gamer writer Steven Messner called it \"gleefully gory\" and said it \"succeeds on the merits of its stellar combat and level design.\" Modeled after Left 4 Dead, the game sees you and a few mates trawl around the ruins of Warhammer Fantasy's apocalypse, cleaving rats into chunks in first-person.

Rock & Road is a survival, resource-gathering, tower defence, roguelike, city-builder, Vampire Survivors-like. Phew. (Image credit: Ludogram) Ok, now that's out of the way, we can break down what that actually means. Basically, in each run you are the custodian of a city on wheels, as it rolls along pursued by ever-escalating hordes of monsters. Your character has auto-firing weapons, like in Vampire Survivors, but so does the city.

If your hero dies, you simply place a grave in your city and spawn a new one—but if your city takes too many hits, it crumbles, and the run is over. So guarding your home as it trundles along is vital… but you're also encouraged to risk breaking away to explore.

Now, as the second half of 2025 withers away, it's back, officially known as PUBG: Black Budget and with a closed alpha test set to begin in December. Developed by PUBG Studios, Black Budget is a PvPvE shooter set on a remote island that's trapped in a time loop and also being consumed by a supernatural phenomenon called—wait for it—the Anomaly. Okay, no points for originality there, but the game also promises \"a focus on exploration and discovery rather than pure survival and combat,\" which I do find interesting. I've really been enjoying Arc Raiders lately, primarily because it's proven a far more cooperative experience than it appears at first blush, so an extraction shooter that leans into that side of the gameplay, as opposed to just shooting the hell out of everything, is one I want to know more about.

(Image credit: Activision) \"Aim assist is a big conversation and we have been closely monitoring that conversation, and of course, looking at our internal data, we're fairly happy with where we're at,\" Scronce says. \"But we will be making some very nuanced changes and slightly increasing aim assist's strength over range ahead of Season 1.\" The goal is apparently \"to create a more balanced and competitive experience\" by increasing the range of rotational aim assist. Although this comes with a new requirement: a player's right stick movement has to track an enemy for rotational aim assist to activate at its full strength. Which may work to balance out the aim assist strength buff,…",

The sad news, however, is they chose this nonsense over the far superior choice of \"Bernard.\" It does make you wonder whether, out in space, there are some reds under the bed. The vote was a narrow one, with New York Supreme winning out with 62,674 votes to the noble Bernard's 53,480. This follows another player vote which saw a destroyed city re-named as \"Gun\", which is at least in keeping with the game's themes. Players are inexplicably cock-a-hoop with the result, with the Helldivers 2 subreddit filled with posts celebrating New York Supreme's victory. \"New York Supreme sounds like something outta Taco Bell\" notes player Pale_Spend 2052 and, you know, they're right. Nevertheless, the celebrations continue: LONG LIVE NEW YORK SUPREME from r/Helldivers I love Democracy from r/Helldivers What a thing to wake up to! from r/Helldivers There is one slightly more serious note to come out of this.

Not only that, but the new lead has a new voice actor , with Ciara Berkeley stepping into the role in place of Jo Wyatt. Geralt's long-time voice actor, Doug Cockle, has been enthusiastic about the choice to have Ciri take the lead —and withering towards people who need to \"read the damn books\" . And now, in a sweet display of voice actor camaraderie, he's stated that he thinks Berkeley will nail the new role, too. That's per an interview our friends over at GamesRadar+ did with The Witcher vet during the Golden Joystick Awards 2025. Cockle states that he hadn't met Berkeley in person until the awards themselves, but now that he has? He's sold. \"I only spoke with her briefly, just today.

Either way, getting ambushed by a raider crawling around behind you is hard to come back from. Ignoring the bad AI voice acting, Arc Raiders' audio is pretty stellar for the most part. But I'll admit, I've been jumpscared quite a few times now by players suddenly appearing out of thin air simply because I didn't hear them coming—thankfully, most have actually been friendly. Nevertheless, I'd rather not get jumped like that again, and there's actually a rather simple solution I've found for it. Head into the audio settings and enable Night Mode , found just under the audio output option at the top of the list What this does is basically compresses the dynamic range of audio, so loud sounds like gunshots and explosions are quieter and soft sounds like footsteps are louder. As the name hints at, it's also good for avoiding sudden audio spikes, which is nice if you're tired or have sensitive hearing…",

On the gaming-relevant side of things, you can pick up: A build-your-own Cyberpunk 2077 bundle that includes comics and a lore book. A Mass Effect bundle that includes comics and three art books. A Dragon Age bundle that includes comics, an art book, and two lore books. A Halo bundle that includes comics, a making-of book, and a lore encyclopedia. That's all digital-only, but as ever the value proposition is ridiculous. That Mass Effect bundle for example is just $9 for nearly $140 worth of stuff. As I said when I wrote about Fanatical's recent Witcher comics bundle (still available, by the way), I think they're doing great work over there. The files are well-organised and easy to download, and it's a great way to get into the increasingly cost-effective hobby of reading comics digitally on your tablet.

Which was not only on purpose, says Team Cherry, but a tactic the developer will be carrying on into the future. If they ever made a new Hollow Knight game, that is. That's per an interview contained in a paperback guide for the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (thanks, GamesRadar+ ). Co-director Ari Gibson told ACMI that Silksong was intended to \"stand alongside Hollow Knight,\" and that the two games \"really complement each other\". However, Gibson also notes that \"I don't think you'd feel like you lost anything, travelling back to the original game after playing Silksong.

For instance, are you excited to hear that, per CEO Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft is \"making great strides in applying gen-AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams\"?

On the plus side, this is a very speedy monitor, even by OLED standards. It tops out at 480 Hz refresh, making it one of the quicker 1440p gaming OLEDs out there. It's also relatively reasonably priced for a model with 480 Hz refresh, typically coming in around $700 or £800.

But stand down, folks. Ubisoft's delayed financial report took place earlier today, and it turns out all that hullabaloo was—per company big boss Yves Guillemot—for perhaps the most boring reason imaginable: \"We appointed a new panel of auditors, that was approved at the [Annual General Meeting] last July.\" Oh. In essence, Ubi's new numbers guys decided that revenues from one of its partnerships from the fiscal year before this one needed to be recognised in a different way.

This holiday DLC was previously announced as a premium, paid pack, but Gearbox explains that it couldn't quite do everything it planned to before it had to release it, so it opted to make it free instead. To ensure those who own the Deluxe and above versions of the game still get the content they paid upfront for, there will be another DLC in the future, Bounty Pack 5. \"This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year.

I am generally ambivalent about Windows 11's aesthetic. The icons and menus are mostly uninspired but serviceable, blending in with 2020s corporate visual design in a manner befitting an operating system that's iterated itself into a state of near non-identity ( AI will solve that problem, of course !). The desire for, I guess, cohesive branding has hit some Windows icons harder than others. Every Microsoft Office application is now represented by an amorphous blob of color that suggests the vague idea of a thing. It's funny that a decade or so ago we were remarking upon the fact that the go-to save icon, a floppy disk, is a meaningless reference for young people. Now Microsoft has deliberately chosen to turn Outlook's icon into MC Escher's interpretation of an envelope. Take that art history elective if you want to use Office, I guess! (Image …",

But where the previous Spider-Man crossover set was content to wrap deep cuts from the Spider-Verse in existing mechanics, Avatar is more systemically ambitious, giving each flavor of elemental bending its own mechanic. Which is an interesting choice for a set you would expect to be aimed at younger players, but I guess they figured if a 12-year-old can play Magic and make it through the filler episodes where Aang and the gang trudge through a swamp or a town where things are a bit weird then they can sure as hell learn some new rules.

And developer Chief Rebel has the numbers to show it. In a new developer update video , community director Hamish Bode laid out some fun numbers from the game's first month in early access. Even though Fellowship has a long road ahead of it, players have already sunk in a combined 7.2 million hours played. In that time, over 9 million dungeons have been cleared. Bode didn't share the number of dungeons players failed to clear, but he did say that they've died over 49 million times. Ouch. All of that is really just proof that a game where you can run MMO-style dungeons over and over is exactly the kind of thing people have been hoping someone would make.

Path of Exile 2's The Last of the Druids update is coming on December 12. Druids will join the other seven classes and, because this is PoE, will come with a bunch of new skills that anyone can use. However, only the druids will be able to shapeshift into a bear and other animals on the fly. Developer Grinding Gear Games previewed the druid two years ago , and that was the last time we saw them. They didn't make it into the game for its early access debut and narrowly missed the last update. And now, it looks like GGG is ready to release them out into the world. In that preview video, you can see the pretty classic druid fantasy on display: In their human form they can call down lightning strikes and pull lava out of the ground, and then they can transform into a bear to pulverize packs of monsters.

They openly cheat, regularly bending or breaking rules to give computer-controlled characters an unfair advantage, so much so that even the shortest session can rapidly erode any sense of goodwill anyone ever had for blood-splattered fighting games.

I wouldn't put much stock in that last one though. Rumors about a possible Sims 4 remaster came to a boil earlier this week thanks to a post by The Sims Community collecting a small handful of vague \"I know something you don't\" style posts on X by those claiming to have some inside info. It's either a \"rewrite\" of The Sims 4 or a \"remaster\" or \"Sims 4 HD,\" according to a variety of unconfirmed sources. There were also images leaked from a playtest—of what appears to be the same mobile Sims game playtests that have been leaking on the regular for around a year—along with mention of a \"platform for the future\" likely referring to the same The Sims Hub that EA vaguely announced last year and has yet to officially mention again.
