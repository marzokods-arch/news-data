We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it—or at least that's what my history teacher always said. (Yet despite skipping class the day we learned about the War of the Austrian Succession, I still haven't invaded Silesia. I knew that guy was full of it!) But forget real history (I always do) and let's talk about videogame history. You probably remember the year, and maybe even the day, your favorite videogame was released, especially if you're now counting the days, and maybe even the years, until the sequel comes out. Time to put your release date knowledge to the test in our first \"sort 'em out\" style quiz. In each question in the quiz below, I'll give you three games, and all you have to do is put them in order of their release, from earliest to latest. I'm not asking you to know the specific dates, you just have to put 'em in the right order by dragging and dropping 'em. Good luck, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

The process is laid out in a YouTube short from BG3 aficionado and seeming evil mastermind Morgana Evelyn titled \"Child Labour is Unbeatable.\" That name alone should tell you what kind of moral dimensions we're working with here. If the idea of conscripting a horde of combat orphans doesn't pass your ethical sniff test, you probably won't enjoy where the rest of this goes. To pull this off, you'll need a level 7 Companion character with access to the Dominate Beast and Polymorph spells. With that character, you'll need to select your ideal child combatant—or because they all perform identically, any child combatant—and polymorph them. Once they're in sheep shape, hit them with Dominate Beast, and then travel to your camp. Once there, Morgana recommends enabling tu…",

Sounds unbelievable, but it's true! Audio experts, laptop makers and Windows developers all worked together to confirm the story—so when I was re-reading the 2022 Microsoft blog that first made the story news, I suddenly found myself wondering what other damage precisely the right (or, I suppose, wrong) sound frequency could do. For example: Could you cause a chicken's head to explode with just the power of sound? A comment on the 2022 blog casually suggests that perhaps such a thing is possible. \"There is also the story of the resonant frequency of chicken skulls from the old Borland Turbo C++ documentation,\" it says.

That's a tremendous deal on one of the best (and only) big budget singleplayer shooters in recent years, especially considering it's barely six months old. Is it the best Doom of the modern trilogy?

And that's a difference that's not likely to change, for one simple reason: Epic boss Tim Sweeney thinks AI disclosures are a waste of time. \"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation,\" Sweeney wrote on X (via GamesRadar), agreeing with a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. \"It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.\" (Image credit: Tim Sweeney (Twitter)) This isn't the first time Sweeney has expressed support for generative AI: Earlier this month, for instance, he waded into the debate over Arc Raiders' use of AI-generated voices with a fantasy about games with \"infinite, context-sensitive, personality-reflecting dialog based on and tuned by human voice actors .\" And he's prob…",

It convinced me that Paralives is going to avoid the biggest flaw in Inzoi's early access: a lifeless Live Mode. The whole 45 minutes of new gameplay takes place with a single playable \"para\" in his small flat and the shopping square below it. That may sound like a red flag for the state of the game, but I was way less worried about seeing the breadth of the Paralives neighborhood and more interested in the depth of its simulation. Some things that piqued my interest: The daily local newspaper that gives some in-world ideas for activities you should pursue Really prominent skill progress bars and skill level up notifications Conversation system that encourages you to choose between options, not spam the same interaction Personality trait upgrades that give gameplay buffs like playing music to remove sad emotions Contextual moods like being embar…",

Reactions have been mixed on how the developers are simplifying the many classes of WoW to work without needing mods, or addons, to tell you what to do. Game director Ion Hazzikostas made his case for why these changes needed to happen now and promised to be listening carefully to players as the beta continues. Everything else seems to be going pretty smoothly—well, except the fish that ate everyone's frame rate.

Shores of Vaelithar got its start as a viral, five-second clip generated by Midjourney and shared on X by its creator studio, Desimulate. It showed a first-person view of a stylised, lo-fi fantasy game—foreboding castle, rolling green plains and all. The version of the game which now has a Steam page—and, notably, no AI-generated content notice—looks similar but a touch different. That's because, Desimulate told PCGN, all the material in the actual game \"is …",

On the latter front, though, Microsoft seems to be doing what it can to improve the new handheld-oriented version of Windows towards, well, handhelds, and the latest here is that it's now introduced 'Default Game Profiles.' If you have an ROG Xbox Ally or ROG Xbox Ally X , with this update you should now be able to select profiles for different games tailored to balancing performance and battery life. Xbox says: \"This means smoother, more enjoyable gameplay and extended battery life, without requiring manual adjustments. For example, in Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Default Game Profile can add nearly an hour of battery life compared to Performance mode while still delivering smooth 120 fps gameplay.\" There are currently, at launch, 40 supported games, including Fortnite , Gears of War: Reloaded , and Hollow Knight: Silksong .

We're also curious if we'll see some familiar faces. Fallout: New Vegas is packed with interesting and memorable characters, and if I were a betting man I'd wager a few chips that we'll see at least one or two people (or mutants) we know from the games appear in the show. But which characters from Fallout: New Vegas are most (or least) likely to appear in Fallout Season 2? Here are the odds as I see them. Mr. House 🎰 Odds: 1/1 (Image credit: Prime Video) We know for sure Mr. House is in Fallout Season 2—he's shown in the teaser as the pre-war Mr. House, played by Justin Theroux, and in the trailer as the post-war Mr. House, a digital face on a TV screen. It wouldn't be New Vegas without him. But didn't Mr. House die in some playthroughs of Fallout: New Vegas? You can kill Mr. House in the game (I sure did), but that could probably be wr…",

We spent the better part of this year lamenting ridiculously high GPU prices , and as soon as said prices finally start dropping , memory and storage prices start climbing. We're in a memory shortage right now, and this applies to both DRAM memory used for RAM and NAND memory used for SSDs, and it will likely also affect GPUs, too. This shortage means there's more demand than supply, which causes prices to rise. We're already seeing RAM prices skyrocket, and prices for SSDs and even GPUs could follow suit before long. We're keeping track of the latest changes to RAM prices here. The cause is mostly the newly booming AI industry, as AI servers require a lot of memory, both in terms of long-term storage and short-term system memory. And many of the same production facilities that make memory for these AI servers also make memory for our RAM, SSDs, and graphics cards, thus why there's an impact on PC gaming hardware.

It was a means to an end, so to speak, that end being room for more junk, of course. That's not to say I couldn't feel the difference between a naked gun and a decked-out one; I just didn't put much thought into it. Needless to say, it wasn't optimal, in part because I'd entirely underestimated attachments in favour of trying to accumulate a stockpile of the best guns . After watching ModernNik's impressively comprehensive attachment breakdown, I won't be making those same mistakes again. They tested every type of attachment, and even though some of the gains may look small—like a 0.16ms recoil recovery boost from a common stock—it all adds up. By far my biggest takeaway is that the 'quality sweet-spot', for lack of a better term, is often green, uncommon attachments.

Vendetta, also known as La Lupa, is one of the most distinctive heroes we've seen in Overwatch, and that's primarily because she's the first true melee character. \"But what about Doomfist or Brigitte?\", I hear you say. While these two are technically melee, they're not really when you think about it. Vendetta is almost entirely a sword-slinging brawler with a primary attack that can combo, and that's what makes her different. So when can you play her? Overwatch 2 Vendetta hero trial release time Vendetta's hero trial begins on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, at 11 am PT / 2 pm EST / 7 pm GMT to Monday, December 1 , at the same times, which coincides with the usual update time for the game.

If you have a lifelong dream of being a technical sound designer on the sequel to Beyond Good and Evil, but were unfortunately a child when it was first revealed back in 2008, now's your chance. Ubi is looking for someone to work in Montpellier and \"provide technical solutions for integrating and implementing audio systems to ensure that the audio assets created by the team work as intended, in line with the Audio Director’s vision\". Which, I suppose, no one's gotten around to in the last 17 years. \"Beyond Good & Evil 2 is an action-adventure open world game set in a captivating space opera universe and the direct prequel to the 2003 cult classic,\" goes the blurb. \"Based on a breakthrough technology driven by the proprietary Voyager engine, Beyond Good & Evil 2 aims to offer a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations.\" Not mentioned: the…",

The Temple of Elemental Evil is fondly remembered by D&D fans for its meticulous adaptation of the scenario into the then newly released 3.5 edition. \"It may not be the best D&D game, but it is the most D&D game,\" PC Gamer's Jody Macgregor wrote back in 2017. \"Being alone at a computer isn't the same as sitting round a table shouting every time someone rolls a 20 or putting on a silly voice and making everyone laugh, but The Temple of Elemental Evil gets surprisingly close to recreating that atmosphere.\" The RPG has been quietly kept alive by modders for years.

    "body": "Sound the Reedus alarm—it seems all-but-certain that Death Stranding 2 is headed for PC in the surprisingly near future. As spotted by Gematsu —part-time videogame age-rating board and full-time surprise spoiler (I ain't complaining), the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) recently surfaced a rating for a \"Windows PC\" version of Hideo Kojima's latest postman simulator. It's Mature 17+, in case you were wondering. This would suggest that DS2 is due for a release on god's own platform pretty sharpish, which might come as some surprise. It certainly surprised me. After all, the PS5 version of that game only released in June this year, and I still remember writing news stories about ex-PS boss Jim Ryan declaring that PC players would be waiting \" two or three years \" for the platform's exclusives to make the migration. But it wouldn't be so strange for DS2 to jump across so soon after its console launch. Death Stranding 1 , after all, came to PC in July 2020 after its initial PS4 release in November 2019, and it even came with glitzy add-ons, like a photo mode and some crossover stuff. I wouldn't be surprised if the second game got the same treatment. Of course, Sony and Kojim…",

When you complete a task for this week's challenges, you'll earn points towards that objective and earn a place on the leaderboard. The competition can get intense, to say the least. But if you're looking to earn all the unique Trials rewards, you're going to need to step up to the plate and give it a shot. Below, I'll go over all the Trials challenges this week and the best way to complete them for a high score. Arc Raiders Trials this week (Image credit: Embark) Right off the bat, it's important to understand how scoring works. Firstly, only your personal best score during a single run for each challenge contributes to your overall ranking, so you need to be prepared. Secondly, you can earn double Trial Score points when map conditions are active , such as Night Raid, Electromagnetic Storm, and Hidden Bunker, so you're always best off attempting the challenges on these runs. Plus, it's basically always easier to attempt these with two other players, not just because it's easier to stay alive, but also because the score is often shared, letti…",

According to the Geekbench entry , we're talking 2,849 single-core points and 15,434 multi-core points. Arguably, it's the single-core result that's most interesting as it theoretically allows for a direct comparison between different generations of Intel Performance cores. The multi-core comparison is complicated by the vagaries of difference Performance, Efficient and Low Power Efficient core configurations, albeit the total result is, ultimately, the total result. The specific Panther Lake model appearing in the Geekbench results is the Core Ultra 9 386H, a mobile CPU as all Panther Lake chips will be at launch. It shows up as a 16-core model on Geekbench and is expected to have four Performance, eight Efficient, and four Low Power Efficient cores. The closest existing Intel CPU for comparison is the Core Ultra 9 285H, which is a similarly configured 16-core mobile chip, albeit with six Performance and two Low Power Efficient cores.

The Portal server browser was a dumpster fire at first, hosting dozens upon dozens of lazy XP farms that clogged up EA's servers so bad you couldn't even start your own friend lobby. Then, DICE nerfed XP farms into the ground. Folks complained, some who apparently only bought BF6 to shoot at bots demanded refunds, and many XP farming servers were taken offline. Now weeks later, I decided to check in on the BF6's Portal tab, hoping to find folks using Portal the way I hoped they would from the start: creating neat custom games and hosting specialized servers. I'm pleased to report both are happening, but not in huge amounts. First, the good news: Legitimately fun custom games are starting to pop up, several of which resemble the sort of goofy stuff you'd find perusing the custom lobbies of Halo or Garry's Mod. The most popular one of the moment is Chaos Climb by Forstorare (Portal code: zx45f) . Instead of describing it, I'd rather show you what it's all about: To me, this is videogames. What I dig about Chaos Climb is how it flexes the one big thing that Portal has that …",

One thing interesting (and, I think, new) about the Battlefield 6 free trial is that you don't access it through Battlefield 6, as you might expect; if you hop around to the BF6 Steam page , you'll see there's no sort of \"try me free!\" option available. Instead, you get to it through Battlefield Redsec , the battle royale mode, which is always free to play. But during the trial period, you'll also have access to three playlists, including a \"casual multiplayer experience,\" across three maps: Siege of Cairo, Eastwood, and Blackwell Fields.\" In a nice nod to newcomers, EA also provided a handy breakdown of each game mode available in the trial, as well as some tips on how to play them effectively .

It might be just what you need, too—especially now that Reforged has its own private multiplayer servers, the headline feature of its recent 2.0 update . Even more ambitiously than the popular Seamless Co-op mod (which is also fully supported here), Reforged bypasses the original game's anti-cheat systems while retaining bloodstains, phantoms, summons and invasions. Helpful, as there are more than 1,200 collectible stat-boosting rune fragments hidden throughout the entire game like Crackdown's irresistible agility orbs, many of which you'd never find without other kindly players placing glowing, tongue-in-cheek hints.

The answer is no: Last Epoch's expansion will be free to anyone who already owns the base game, and it will be packed in for anyone who buys the game after it's out. Last month, EHG founder Judd Cobler said the studio would \"maybe\" have to charge something for the expansion, as the game's first three seasons haven't been profitable. But now it looks like EHG will hold to the promise it made when it ran a Kickstarter for the game in 2018. There's a small catch here though: Alongside the expansion a new \"Paradox class\" will be released and it will have a price that won't be revealed until later.

    "body": "When Moonlighter released in 2018, it was to a fairly positive critical reception. Players seemed to enjoy the combination of cozy shop simulator and dungeon crawling roguelite, inspired by the Rogue Legacies and Stardew Valleys of the time. Some grumbled about a lack of depth and incentive to keep returning to the dungeon again and again, and seven years later developer Digital Sun is ready to show us what it’s learned from those criticisms. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is now available in early access on Steam. I spent several hours with it over the past week, and it already feels like a more focused and refined version of the original. The premise remains unchanged: you play as Will, a shopkeep-slash-dungeoneer who is looking to turn his spoils into cold hard cash. The core loop involves diving into randomized dungeons, fighting the monsters there, filling your backpack with loot, selling it for a tidy profit, and doing it all again. Inventory management itself is a puzzle, as items interact with each other in your backpack, forcing you to think carefully about how you use the limited space. In essence, it’s three games in one, each section complete with its own rules. Whil…",

Our small ray of sunshine is this: One novelist and games writer has just bought back the rights to the zombie-themed fitness app that she's been writing for over a decade from the blockchain company that had planned to shut it down. Naomi Alderman is a published author of science fiction novels. And for years she's also been the lead writer for a gamified fitness app called Zombies, Run! It encourages players to get on the move by listening to episodic post-apocalyptic stories, interval training while actively 'running from zombies,' and supplies rewards from workout sessions to upgrade their survival base. Alderman co-created the app and wrote its years' worth of voice-acted, episodic stories that have amassed over 10 million users since 2012. My best friend has been evangelizing this game to me (unsuccessfully only because I hate running) on the grounds of its excellent story for all 13 of those years, even when its future was looking bleak more recently.

But all that spending may be catching up with the PIF, as a new report suggests that it is running low on cash for further investments. According to the New York Times (via GamesIndustry ) the PIF is restricting operations under the eye of Crown Prince Mohammed, as numerous projects it has invested in are under \"financial distress\". It's worth noting that none of these distressed investments are directly related to gaming. Troubled projects include Saudi Arabia's ambitious (some may say preposterous) city construction project Neom , with its plans for a 105 mile, glass-walled city called \"The Line\" being massively scaled back . Other struggling investments cited by the NYT include a coffee chain with just one shop, a cruise line with one lonely ship, and \"an electric vehicle start-up begun three years ago that has yet to deliver a car.\" The …",

You can find Thomas in everything from Hogwarts Legacy to Elden Ring , but it all began with a 2013 Skyrim mod that replaced all dragons with the resplendent blue engine, as well as adding sound effects from the show. That Skyrim mod was down to game developer and modder Trainwiz (and friends), who notes in his Bluesky bio that \"Mattel is out to kill me.\" This is because toy giant Mattel owns the rights to the Thomas the Tank Engine characters, and doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humour about Thomas mods. Thus, we arrive at a new frontier for Thomas-based heroics. Trainwiz has popped up with a new mod for Morrowind that \"replaces cliff racers with Thomas the Tank Engine.\" Cliff racers are flying creatures that appear all around the Vvardenfell region of Morrowind, and occasionally swarm the player. The reason that you can now get got by countless flying Thomases?

Bits like whipping a fish out of the water so you can quick-scope it in midair with a bolt-action rifle for bonus XP. The description on the How to Fish Steam listing doesn't do it justice: \"You and your friends are out drinking and boating. You crash into a small island where you have to fish using everything from fishing rods to assault rifles,\" it explains. \"Sell your catch, earn money, buy better fishing gear, and defeat boss fishes to unlock new islands and finally make it back home.\" We've been living in a post- Ridiculous Fishing world of absurdist angling for years. But what catches my eye about How to Fish is the speed of its 0-100 acceleration from traditional fishing to physics-based guntoting dipshittery.
