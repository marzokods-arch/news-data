(Yet despite skipping class the day we learned about the War of the Austrian Succession, I still haven't invaded Silesia. I knew that guy was full of it!) But forget real history (I always do) and let's talk about videogame history. You probably remember the year, and maybe even the day, your favorite videogame was released, especially if you're now counting the days, and maybe even the years, until the sequel comes out. Time to put your release date knowledge to the test in our first \"sort 'em out\" style quiz. In each question in the quiz below, I'll give you three games, and all you have to do is put them in order of their release, from earliest to latest. I'm not asking you to know the specific dates, you just have to put 'em in the right order by dragging and dropping 'em. Good luck, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

They're building armies of children. The process is laid out in a YouTube short from BG3 aficionado and seeming evil mastermind Morgana Evelyn titled \"Child Labour is Unbeatable.\" That name alone should tell you what kind of moral dimensions we're working with here. If the idea of conscripting a horde of combat orphans doesn't pass your ethical sniff test, you probably won't enjoy where the rest of this goes. To pull this off, you'll need a level 7 Companion character with access to the Dominate Beast and Polymorph spells. With that character, you'll need to select your ideal child combatant—or because they all perform identically, any child combatant—and polymorph them. Once they're in sheep shape, hit them with Dominate Beast, and then travel to your camp. Once there, Morgana recommends ena…",

When played on (or even near) those laptops, the song would cause the drives to malfunction—and it was such a widespread problem that Microsoft incorporated code into Windows XP to filter out that particular frequency. Sounds unbelievable, but it's true! Audio experts, laptop makers and Windows developers all worked together to confirm the story—so when I was re-reading the 2022 Microsoft blog that first made the story news, I suddenly found myself wondering what other damage precisely the right (or, I suppose, wrong) sound frequency could do. For example: Could you cause a chicken's head to explode with just the power of sound? A comment on the 2022 blog casually suggests that perhaps such a thing is possible. \"There is also the story of the resonant frequency of chicken skulls from the old Borland Turbo C++ documentation,\" it says.

It's not one of Steam's \"big\" sales of the year—the kind that takes over the entire store page and gives away stickers—but it does have one standout deal that you should really consider for the FPS enjoyer in your life. Doom: The Dark Ages is on sale at 50% off, marked down to $34.99 . That's a tremendous deal on one of the best (and only) big budget singleplayer shooters in recent years, especially considering it's barely six months old. Is it the best Doom of the modern trilogy? No, but id gave itself a tough act to follow, and The Dark Ages is still gigantic and impressive in different ways than Doom '16 and its 2020 followup, Eternal. As I wrote in my 80% Doom: The Dark Ages review back in May: \"This is Doom at its most indulgent and deliciously violent, but it's also dumbed down and undeniably the easiest of the trilogy. Maps are uncharacteristically barren, secrets abnormally obvious, and puzzles so simple that they hardly fit the description. Viewed through the…",

And that's a difference that's not likely to change, for one simple reason: Epic boss Tim Sweeney thinks AI disclosures are a waste of time. \"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation,\" Sweeney wrote on X (via GamesRadar), agreeing with a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. \"It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.\" (Image credit: Tim Sweeney (Twitter)) This isn't the first time Sweeney has expressed support for generative AI: Earlier this month, for instance, he waded into the debate over Arc Raiders' use of AI-generated voices with a fantasy about games with \"infinite, context-sensitive, personality-reflecting dialog based on and tuned by human voice actors .\" And he's prob…",

The whole 45 minutes of new gameplay takes place with a single playable \"para\" in his small flat and the shopping square below it.

Everything else seems to be going pretty smoothly—well, except the fish that ate everyone's frame rate.

Shores of Vaelithar got its start as a viral, five-second clip generated by Midjourney and shared on X by its creator studio, Desimulate.

Xbox says: \"This means smoother, more enjoyable gameplay and extended battery life, without requiring manual adjustments.

We're also curious if we'll see some familiar faces.

We're in a memory shortage right now, and this applies to both DRAM memory used for RAM and NAND memory used for SSDs, and it will likely also affect GPUs, too. This shortage means there's more demand than supply, which causes prices to rise. We're already seeing RAM prices skyrocket, and prices for SSDs and even GPUs could follow suit before long. We're keeping track of the latest changes to RAM prices here. The cause is mostly the newly booming AI industry, as AI servers require a lot of memory, both in terms of long-term storage and short-term system memory. And many of the same production facilities that make memory for these AI servers also make memory for our RAM, SSDs, and graphics cards, thus why there's an impact on PC gaming hardware.

It was a means to an end, so to speak, that end being room for more junk, of course. That's not to say I couldn't feel the difference between a naked gun and a decked-out one; I just didn't put much thought into it. Needless to say, it wasn't optimal, in part because I'd entirely underestimated attachments in favour of trying to accumulate a stockpile of the best guns . After watching ModernNik's impressively comprehensive attachment breakdown, I won't be making those same mistakes again. They tested every type of attachment, and even though some of the gains may look small—like a 0.16ms recoil recovery boost from a common stock—it all adds up. By far my biggest takeaway is that the 'quality sweet-spot', for lack of a better term, is often green, uncommon attachments.

Vendetta, also known as La Lupa, is one of the most distinctive heroes we've seen in Overwatch, and that's primarily because she's the first true melee character. \"But what about Doomfist or Brigitte?\", I hear you say. While these two are technically melee, they're not really when you think about it. Vendetta is almost entirely a sword-slinging brawler with a primary attack that can combo, and that's what makes her different. So when can you play her? Overwatch 2 Vendetta hero trial release time Vendetta's hero trial begins on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, at 11 am PT / 2 pm EST / 7 pm GMT to Monday, December 1 , at the same times, which coincides with the usual update time for the game.

If you have a lifelong dream of being a technical sound designer on the sequel to Beyond Good and Evil, but were unfortunately a child when it was first revealed back in 2008, now's your chance. Ubi is looking for someone to work in Montpellier and \"provide technical solutions for integrating and implementing audio systems to ensure that the audio assets created by the team work as intended, in line with the Audio Director’s vision\". Which, I suppose, no one's gotten around to in the last 17 years. \"Beyond Good & Evil 2 is an action-adventure open world game set in a captivating space opera universe and the direct prequel to the 2003 cult classic,\" goes the blurb. \"Based on a breakthrough technology driven by the proprietary Voyager engine, Beyond Good & Evil 2 aims to offer a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations.\" Not mentioned: the…",

The Temple of Elemental Evil is fondly remembered by D&D fans for its meticulous adaptation of the scenario into the then newly released 3.5 edition. \"It may not be the best D&D game, but it is the most D&D game,\" PC Gamer's Jody Macgregor wrote back in 2017. \"Being alone at a computer isn't the same as sitting round a table shouting every time someone rolls a 20 or putting on a silly voice and making everyone laugh, but The Temple of Elemental Evil gets surprisingly close to recreating that atmosphere.\" The RPG has been quietly kept alive by modders for years.

    "body": "Trials in Arc Raiders is effectively a ranking system where you compete against other players for high scores on five challenges each week. When you complete a task for this week's challenges, you'll earn points towards that objective and earn a place on the leaderboard. The competition can get intense, to say the least. But if you're looking to earn all the unique Trials rewards, you're going to need to step up to the plate and give it a shot. Below, I'll go over all the Trials challenges this week and the best way to complete them for a high score. Arc Raiders Trials this week (Image credit: Embark) Right off the bat, it's important to understand how scoring works. Firstly, only your personal best score during a single run for each challenge contributes to your overall ranking, so you need to be prepared. Secondly, you can earn double Trial Score points when map conditions are active , such as Night Raid, Electromagnetic Storm, and Hidden Bunker, so you're always best off attempting the challenges on these runs. Plus, it's basically always easier to attempt these with two other players, not just because it's easier to stay alive, but also because the score is often shared, letti…",

According to the Geekbench entry , we're talking 2,849 single-core points and 15,434 multi-core points. Arguably, it's the single-core result that's most interesting as it theoretically allows for a direct comparison between different generations of Intel Performance cores. The multi-core comparison is complicated by the vagaries of difference Performance, Efficient and Low Power Efficient core configurations, albeit the total result is, ultimately, the total result. The specific Panther Lake model appearing in the Geekbench results is the Core Ultra 9 386H, a mobile CPU as all Panther Lake chips will be at launch. It shows up as a 16-core model on Geekbench and is expected to have four Performance, eight Efficient, and four Low Power Efficient cores. The closest existing Intel CPU for comparison is the Core Ultra 9 285H, which is a similarly configured 16-core mobile chip, albeit with six Performance and two Low Power Efficient cores. It scores 2,608 single-core points and 14,812 multi-core points . In that context, Intel…",

These will be transferred to THQ Nordic, which already owns the IP rights and Remnant's developer Gunfire Games.

Then, DICE nerfed XP farms into the ground. Folks complained, some who apparently only bought BF6 to shoot at bots demanded refunds, and many XP farming servers were taken offline. Now weeks later, I decided to check in on the BF6's Portal tab, hoping to find folks using Portal the way I hoped they would from the start: creating neat custom games and hosting specialized servers. I'm pleased to report both are happening, but not in huge amounts. First, the good news: Legitimately fun custom games are starting to pop up, several of which resemble the sort of goofy stuff you'd find perusing the custom lobbies of Halo or Garry's Mod. The most popular one of the moment is Chaos Climb by Forstorare (Portal code: zx45f) . Instead of describing it, I'd rather show you what it's all about: To me, this is videogames.

    "body": "Electronic Arts announced last week that a free trial for Battlefield 6 , \"the best selling shooter of 2025\" (a bold claim given that it's still ongoing), would get underway on November 25 . Well, today is November 25, and yeah, you can probably see where I'm going with this. The Battlefield 6 free trial is live! One thing interesting (and, I think, new) about the Battlefield 6 free trial is that you don't access it through Battlefield 6, as you might expect; if you hop around to the BF6 Steam page , you'll see there's no sort of \"try me free!\" option available. Instead, you get to it through Battlefield Redsec , the battle royale mode, which is always free to play. But during the trial period, you'll also have access to three playlists, including a \"casual multiplayer experience,\" across three maps: Siege of Cairo, Eastwood, and Blackwell Fields.\" In a nice nod to newcomers, EA also provided a handy breakdown of each game mode available in the trial, as well as some tips on how to play them effectively . So if you don't know what Escalation is, for instance, or how to play it in a way that will actually be useful to your team, this is a way to get a sense of the basics without ge…",

It might be just what you need, too—especially now that Reforged has its own private multiplayer servers, the headline feature of its recent 2.0 update . Even more ambitiously than the popular Seamless Co-op mod (which is also fully supported here), Reforged bypasses the original game's anti-cheat systems while retaining bloodstains, phantoms, summons and invasions. Helpful, as there are more than 1,200 collectible stat-boosting rune fragments hidden throughout the entire game like Crackdown's irresistible agility orbs, many of which you'd never find without other kindly players placing glowing, tongue-in-cheek hints. This mod understands that even playing solo, Elden Ring is a shared experience. It just wouldn't be the same without people declaring that every single turtle is actually a dog.

Eleventh Hour Games broke its silence on whether you'll have to pay for Last Epoch's upcoming Orobyss expansion after spending years—as an indie developer—promising players everything would be free. The answer is no: Last Epoch's expansion will be free to anyone who already owns the base game, and it will be packed in for anyone who buys the game after it's out. Last month, EHG founder Judd Cobler said the studio would \"maybe\" have to charge something for the expansion, as the game's first three seasons haven't been profitable. But now it looks like EHG will hold to the promise it made when it ran a Kickstarter for the game in 2018. There's a small catch here though: Alongside the expansion a new \"Paradox class\" will be released and it will have a price that won't be revealed until later. In the announcement post on Reddit, Cobler describes it as a \"fully alternate playable class built on systems that work differently from anything else in the game.\" T…",

Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is now available in early access on Steam. I spent several hours with it over the past week, and it already feels like a more focused and refined version of the original. The premise remains unchanged: you play as Will, a shopkeep-slash-dungeoneer who is looking to turn his spoils into cold hard cash. The core loop involves diving into randomized dungeons, fighting the monsters there, filling your backpack with loot, selling it for a tidy profit, and doing it all again. Inventory management itself is a puzzle, as items interact with each other in your backpack, forcing you to think carefully about how you use the limited space.
