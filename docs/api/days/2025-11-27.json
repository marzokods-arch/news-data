    "body": "We all saw it coming, but it still doesn't feel great. It seems that the RAM shortage that has us all mourning the not-so-terrible prices of a few months ago might now also open the door to a GPU shortage, and small GPU vendors will be hit the hardest. Reputable leaker Golden Pig Upgrade Pack on Weibo (via VideoCardz ) claims Nvidia is planning to stop bundling VRAM with its GPU dies. Nvidia always supplied both the GPU and the VRAM to its add-in card (AIC) partners... well, potentially up until now. This made it easier for GPU manufacturers to stay on spec, but also removed the need for them to source DRAM directly from memory giants like Micron or Samsung. So, Nvidia took care of the VRAM and the GPU die, and the AIC did whatever they wanted with the rest of it, customizing the graphics card before selling it. If Nvidia has indeed decided to only ship the GPU going forward, its board partners will now need to secure VRAM all on their own. Given how volatile normal memory pricing is right now , that could be a challenge for some brands. The short supply of memory doesn't just affect the RAM kits we stick in our PCs. It will extends to VRAM, too, with production being pointed towa…",

Incredibly, it's claimed the chip will pack 288 MB of last-level vertical cache memory. That's well over double the 128 MB of V-Cache currently offered by AMD's top X3D CPU, the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D . This news comes somewhat cryptically from one of the most reliable leakers in the business, kopite7kimi (via WCCFTech ). It's a slightly convoluted data trail. But to cut a long story short, kopite7kimi responded to a story discussing 144 MB verticle cache allocations, which is expected to be known as bLLC or big last level cache in Intel parlance. For certain versions of Intel's upcoming Nova Lake CPUs, kopite7kimi clarified that there will be models with two compute tiles and thus double the stacked cache. So, according to this information, the top Intel Nova Lake CPU will have two compute tiles, each with eight Performance and 16 Efficient cores, plus 144 MB of vertical cache or bLLC. That makes for a total of 48 cores and 288 MB of Intel's equivalent to AMD V-Cache. The chips will also have another four low-power Efficient cores located in the SoC tile, making for a…",

That's Dog Witch in a nutshell really. Its take on roguelike deckbuilding is minimalist, streamlined, and charmingly chill. (Image credit: Heckmouse) In each round of its turn-based battles, you roll a handful of dice, with different faces granting you different effects. The friend symbol, for example, lets you summon a little minion to fight with you, while a bone grants you armour against an enemy hit. As you choose and apply effects, at any point you can choose to re-roll all of your dice up to twice, to fish for specific ones you need. And… that's kind of it. There is some gentle nuance to it. Wands, for example, let you apply damage directly to an enemy, but need to be charged with books to gain damage. Mana stacks up until you have enough to cast a spell, at which point all mana faces become your equipped spell instead, freely cast until the end of the turn. And stopwatches have a chance to stun enemies, or else reduce their resistance for a better chance to stun them next time. (Image credit: Heckmou…",

JRPGs in particular seem to be largely opposed to letting us play dress-up, but western RPGs tend to give us a few more options—both cosmetic and practical. And then there are those that let you completely override the appearance of your gear, so you can pick whatever fit tickles your fancy.

(Image credit: Epic Games) And it's not nostalgia for The Simpsons. That certainly helped—it's one of the few TV shows that spans generations—but more important are the balanced loot pool with plenty of powerful weapons, a fully themed map overflowing with easter eggs, cartoonish overblown mechanics (a revolver than attaches a floaty balloon to players being the standout), lots of movement items and a smaller map, helping trim the mid-round lull you often get in Battle Royale. It's a huge contrast to the recent Star Wars mini-season, which dropped a few themed locations on a big, existing map and whose signature weapons—lightsabers—were underwhelming. The Simpsons map was fully on brand. As I write this, Epic hasn't hinted at The Simpsons remaining past November although I can see them popping up in Blitz, the game'…",

The Roblox survival crafting game sends a constant onslaught of nighttime entities after struggling campers, sometimes making it hard to explore, but it's all for nothing if you don't find the kids. The Deer grows a little more aggressive with each rescue, too, as finding a kid also means adding to your day counter—a curse and a blessing that speeds up the passage of time. There are four Lost Children in total, and you'll have to explore the farthest ends of the map to save them all. If you're struggling to save the Dino Kid, Kraken Kid, Squid Kid, and Koala Kid, don't worry. I've rescued all four more times than I'd like to admit, so here's what you need to know to find all of the Lost Children in 99 Nights in the Forest. How to find the missing children in 99 Nights in the Forest (Image credit: Grandma's Favourite Games) Starting a new game means starting a new 99 Nights in the Forest map, so there's no simple solution to finding all four of the Lost Children at a set location.

(Yet despite skipping class the day we learned about the War of the Austrian Succession, I still haven't invaded Silesia. I knew that guy was full of it!) But forget real history (I always do) and let's talk about videogame history. You probably remember the year, and maybe even the day, your favorite videogame was released, especially if you're now counting the days, and maybe even the years, until the sequel comes out. Time to put your release date knowledge to the test in our first \"sort 'em out\" style quiz. In each question in the quiz below, I'll give you three games, and all you have to do is put them in order of their release, from earliest to latest. I'm not asking you to know the specific dates, you just have to put 'em in the right order by dragging and dropping 'em. Good luck, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

They're building armies of children. The process is laid out in a YouTube short from BG3 aficionado and seeming evil mastermind Morgana Evelyn titled \"Child Labour is Unbeatable.\" That name alone should tell you what kind of moral dimensions we're working with here. If the idea of conscripting a horde of combat orphans doesn't pass your ethical sniff test, you probably won't enjoy where the rest of this goes. To pull this off, you'll need a level 7 Companion character with access to the Dominate Beast and Polymorph spells. With that character, you'll need to select your ideal child combatant—or because they all perform identically, any child combatant—and polymorph them. Once they're in sheep shape, hit them with Dominate Beast, and then travel to your camp. Once there, Morgana recommends ena…",

Sounds unbelievable, but it's true! Audio experts, laptop makers and Windows developers all worked together to confirm the story—so when I was re-reading the 2022 Microsoft blog that first made the story news, I suddenly found myself wondering what other damage precisely the right (or, I suppose, wrong) sound frequency could do. For example: Could you cause a chicken's head to explode with just the power of sound? A comment on the 2022 blog casually suggests that perhaps such a thing is possible. \"There is also the story of the resonant frequency of chicken skulls from the old Borland Turbo C++ documentation,\" it says.

    "body": "If you haven't heard, Steam is having a Black Friday sale for the first time ever. Yep, despite hosting nonstop sale events all year along, this is the first one formally branded around post-Thanksgiving consumerism. It's not one of Steam's \"big\" sales of the year—the kind that takes over the entire store page and gives away stickers—but it does have one standout deal that you should really consider for the FPS enjoyer in your life. Doom: The Dark Ages is on sale at 50% off, marked down to $34.99 . That's a tremendous deal on one of the best (and only) big budget singleplayer shooters in recent years, especially considering it's barely six months old. Is it the best Doom of the modern trilogy? No, but id gave itself a tough act to follow, and The Dark Ages is still gigantic and impressive in different ways than Doom '16 and its 2020 followup, Eternal. As I wrote in my 80% Doom: The Dark Ages review back in May: \"This is Doom at its most indulgent and deliciously violent, but it's also dumbed down and undeniably the easiest of the trilogy. Maps are uncharacteristically barren, secrets abnormally obvious, and puzzles so simple that they hardly fit the description. Viewed through the…",

And that's a difference that's not likely to change, for one simple reason: Epic boss Tim Sweeney thinks AI disclosures are a waste of time. \"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation,\" Sweeney wrote on X (via GamesRadar), agreeing with a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. \"It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.\" (Image credit: Tim Sweeney (Twitter)) This isn't the first time Sweeney has expressed support for generative AI: Earlier this month, for instance, he waded into the debate over Arc Raiders' use of AI-generated voices with a fantasy about games with \"infinite, context-sensitive, personality-reflecting dialog based on and tuned by human voice actors .\" And he's prob…",

The whole 45 minutes of new gameplay takes place with a single playable \"para\" in his small flat and the shopping square below it.

Cyberpunk 2077 has now sold more than 35 million copies, and that's a hell of an accomplishment for any videogame, but it's still way off the 60 million mark set by The Witcher 3 back in May.

Shores of Vaelithar got its start as a viral, five-second clip generated by Midjourney and shared on X by its creator studio, Desimulate. It showed a first-person view of a stylised, lo-fi fantasy game—foreboding castle, rolling green plains and all.

If you have an ROG Xbox Ally or ROG Xbox Ally X , with this update you should now be able to select profiles for different games tailored to balancing performance and battery life. Xbox says: \"This means smoother, more enjoyable gameplay and extended battery life, without requiring manual adjustments. For example, in Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Default Game Profile can add nearly an hour of battery life compared to Performance mode while still delivering smooth 120 fps gameplay.\" There are currently, at launch, 40 supported games, including Fortnite , Gears of War: Reloaded , and Hollow Knight: Silksong .

We're also curious if we'll see some familiar faces. Fallout: New Vegas is packed with interesting and memorable characters, and if I were a betting man I'd wager a few chips that we'll see at least one or two people (or mutants) we know from the games appear in the show.

Mr. House 🎰 Odds: 1/1 (Image credit: Prime Video) We know for sure Mr. House is in Fallout Season 2—he's shown in the teaser as the pre-war Mr. House, played by Justin Theroux, and in the trailer as the post-war Mr. House, a digital face on a TV screen.

We spent the better part of this year lamenting ridiculously high GPU prices , and as soon as said prices finally start dropping , memory and storage prices start climbing. We're in a memory shortage right now, and this applies to both DRAM memory used for RAM and NAND memory used for SSDs, and it will likely also affect GPUs, too. This shortage means there's more demand than supply, which causes prices to rise. We're already seeing RAM prices skyrocket, and prices for SSDs and even GPUs could follow suit before long. We're keeping track of the latest changes to RAM prices here. The cause is mostly the newly booming AI industry, as AI servers require a lot of memory, both in terms of long-term storage and short-term system memory. And many of the same production facilities that make memory for these AI servers also make memory for our RAM, SSDs, and graphics cards, thus why there's an impact on PC gaming hardware.

It was a means to an end, so to speak, that end being room for more junk, of course. That's not to say I couldn't feel the difference between a naked gun and a decked-out one; I just didn't put much thought into it. Needless to say, it wasn't optimal, in part because I'd entirely underestimated attachments in favour of trying to accumulate a stockpile of the best guns . After watching ModernNik's impressively comprehensive attachment breakdown, I won't be making those same mistakes again. They tested every type of attachment, and even though some of the gains may look small—like a 0.16ms recoil recovery boost from a common stock—it all adds up. By far my biggest takeaway is that the 'quality sweet-spot', for lack of a better term, is often green, uncommon attachments.

While these two are technically melee, they're not really when you think about it. Vendetta is almost entirely a sword-slinging brawler with a primary attack that can combo, and that's what makes her different. So when can you play her?

Beyond Good and Evil 2—a videogame that I first got excited for when I was 14 years old (I am now 32)—inexplicably continues development. Not only that, but its team is hiring (via Eurogamer ). If you have a lifelong dream of being a technical sound designer on the sequel to Beyond Good and Evil, but were unfortunately a child when it was first revealed back in 2008, now's your chance. Ubi is looking for someone to work in Montpellier and \"provide technical solutions for integrating and implementing audio systems to ensure that the audio assets created by the team work as intended, in line with the Audio Director’s vision\". Which, I suppose, no one's gotten around to in the last 17 years. \"Beyond Good & Evil 2 is an action-adventure open world game set in a captivating space opera universe and the direct prequel to the 2003 cult classic,\" goes the blurb. \"Based on a breakthrough technology driven by the proprietary Voyager engine, Beyond Good & Evil 2 aims to offer a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations.\" Not mentioned: the…",

The Temple of Elemental Evil is fondly remembered by D&D fans for its meticulous adaptation of the scenario into the then newly released 3.5 edition. \"It may not be the best D&D game, but it is the most D&D game,\" PC Gamer's Jody Macgregor wrote back in 2017. \"Being alone at a computer isn't the same as sitting round a table shouting every time someone rolls a 20 or putting on a silly voice and making everyone laugh, but The Temple of Elemental Evil gets surprisingly close to recreating that atmosphere.\" The RPG has been quietly kept alive by modders for years.

But if you're looking to earn all the unique Trials rewards, you're going to need to step up to the plate and give it a shot. Below, I'll go over all the Trials challenges this week and the best way to complete them for a high score. Arc Raiders Trials this week (Image credit: Embark) Right off the bat, it's important to understand how scoring works. Firstly, only your personal best score during a single run for each challenge contributes to your overall ranking, so you need to be prepared. Secondly, you can earn double Trial Score points when map conditions are active , such as Night Raid, Electromagnetic Storm, and Hidden Bunker, so you're always best off attempting the challenges on these runs.

    "body": "The games industry's biggest fire sale continues, as Embracer Group has sold Star Trek Online developer Cryptic Studio and publisher Arc Games, which also handled publishing duties for games like Remnant 2 , Torchlight , and the recently released old-school MMO Fellowship . The buyer is Project Golden Arc, which is owned and led by members of Arc Games' management. The deal—which is worth $30 million, has been financed by XD Inc, perhaps best known as the developer and publisher of the free-to-play Torchlight Infinite . Embracer will retain the publishing rights to the popular, Soulslike-infused shooters Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant 2. These will be transferred to THQ Nordic, which already owns the IP rights and Remnant's developer Gunfire Games. The rights to Fellowship are also being transferred, but these will be handed over to Satisfactory developer and publisher Coffee Stain, which will be spun off from Embracer to become a publicly traded company on December 11. \"This transaction supports our key priorities by strengthening our focus on strategic assets and core IPs in Embracer while improving profitability and free cash flow,\" Embracer CEO Phil Rogers said in a state…",

    "body": "When Battlefield 6 launched a month and a half ago, one of its most anticipated features basically didn't work. The Portal server browser was a dumpster fire at first, hosting dozens upon dozens of lazy XP farms that clogged up EA's servers so bad you couldn't even start your own friend lobby. Then, DICE nerfed XP farms into the ground. Folks complained, some who apparently only bought BF6 to shoot at bots demanded refunds, and many XP farming servers were taken offline. Now weeks later, I decided to check in on the BF6's Portal tab, hoping to find folks using Portal the way I hoped they would from the start: creating neat custom games and hosting specialized servers. I'm pleased to report both are happening, but not in huge amounts. First, the good news: Legitimately fun custom games are starting to pop up, several of which resemble the sort of goofy stuff you'd find perusing the custom lobbies of Halo or Garry's Mod. The most popular one of the moment is Chaos Climb by Forstorare (Portal code: zx45f) . Instead of describing it, I'd rather show you what it's all about: To me, this is videogames. What I dig about Chaos Climb is how it flexes the one big thing that Portal has that …",

And not for the first time: He shared similar sentiments (and credit for Gustave) back in June , not long after Clair Obscur came out. It should make Charlie very happy, then, that Cazorla is getting credit for his effort: Not from the awards shows, which unfortunately don't generally pay much attention to mocap work, but from the internet at large. \"Thank you for all the messages these past few days,\" Cazorla wrote on X (via GamesRadar ) shortly after Cox's comments came to light. \"Charlie’s words were incredibly generous, and I’m truly grateful. Bringing Gustave to life was a team effort, and I’m honored to have played my part in it.

One thing interesting (and, I think, new) about the Battlefield 6 free trial is that you don't access it through Battlefield 6, as you might expect; if you hop around to the BF6 Steam page , you'll see there's no sort of \"try me free!\" option available. Instead, you get to it through Battlefield Redsec , the battle royale mode, which is always free to play. But during the trial period, you'll also have access to three playlists, including a \"casual multiplayer experience,\" across three maps: Siege of Cairo, Eastwood, and Blackwell Fields.\" In a nice nod to newcomers, EA also provided a handy breakdown of each game mode available in the trial, as well as some tips on how to play them effectively . So if you don't know what Escalation is, for instance, or how to play it in a way that will actually be useful to your team, this is a way to get a sense of the basics without ge…",

It might be just what you need, too—especially now that Reforged has its own private multiplayer servers, the headline feature of its recent 2.0 update . Even more ambitiously than the popular Seamless Co-op mod (which is also fully supported here), Reforged bypasses the original game's anti-cheat systems while retaining bloodstains, phantoms, summons and invasions. Helpful, as there are more than 1,200 collectible stat-boosting rune fragments hidden throughout the entire game like Crackdown's irresistible agility orbs, many of which you'd never find without other kindly players placing glowing, tongue-in-cheek hints.
