Sometimes the contents of these things can't be contained by YouTube scheduling tools or, in the case of Kravitz's villain Bawma, human-made fabrics—as Andy noted in our initial news story, Bawma's \"spectacularly chiselled abs\" are on prominent display in the trailer. And yes, they're the real deal. Earlier in the day Kravitz showed up in person to an event held by IO Interactive to spend a few minutes talking about his first videogame role and his famous workout routines . \"You look like an awesome videogame character already,\" the host said, singling out his abs. \"I try,\" said Lenny Kravitz, far more humbly than I would if I was 61 years old and in fact looked like Lenny Kravitz. Resident Evil actor Milla Jovovich, who was also on stage to promote her role as the next Hitman Elusive Target , had to get in on the abs talk, asking \"they are based on reality, right?\" \"Yes they are,\" Kravitz said. \"That's not a body double.\" It turns out that 'based on reality' is actually underselling…",

After a stage-spanning flight across stormy seas and rocky shores, Keighley did what he does and put the pedal to the metal with both feet. \"Sometimes our last reveal at the Game Awards is a teaser for something years and years away. But not tonight,\" Keighley pronounced with dramatic purpose. \"Our final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that built Apex Legends and Titanfall. Four years ago, the principals founded a new independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter genre forward with a new original game. They've done it in complete secrecy, which is even more amazing because the game is very deep into development. \"The power of independent, self-published studios to push this medium forward is a growing, and I think, positive theme in our industry. …",

We're spoiled by the constant flow of game releases: It would be impossible for me to put any real amount of time into every PC game I was interested in, let alone every game that's well reviewed or recommended by friends and critics I trust. But while there are more than enough games for everyone, that doesn't necessarily mean they're being played. According to SteamDB , more than 19,000 games have launched on Steam in 2025—but almost half of those new releases have been reviewed by fewer than 10 users. (Image credit: SteamDB) Of the 19,112 games represented in SteamDB's data that released in 2025, 9,327 have fewer than 10 reviews. And of those, 2,229 haven't been reviewed at all—meaning more than one in 10 games that launched this year have been left without any kind of user testimonial to inform potential customers. Now, obviously, not every game is going to attract attention, and even fewer will attract positive attention. Speaking as someone who at time of writing has milled through almost 30,000 games in his Steam discovery queue, there's a lot of junk being shoveled onto the platform. But there are also plent…",

Okay, so that's a very rough description of the work conducted by MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the University of Waterloo, and Samsung Electronics. But when you read the details about it in the press release on the matter, you'll see that it's a tad difficult to describe it all in just one sentence. Traditional CMOS chips are fabricated by applying and then etching repeated layers of different materials, applied to a wafer of ultra-pure silicon. The bottom-most layer, also known as the front end according to MIT, comprises the transistors of the chips (or capacities, in the case of DRAM).

It's a game that would be well-served by a remake, in other words—something that had the time necessary to give the original's vision the attention it deserved. Turns out, just such a remake was—perhaps is —notionally in the making. That's according to Game File's recent scoop on Aspyr's ill-fated attempt to get The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (the popular mod that restores a lot of cut-but-still-on-disc content to the game) onto the Nintendo Switch. More on those efforts later. Court filings from the now-settled gamer's lawsuit against Aspyr —initiated by a fan upset at the studio's \"false advertising\" of TSLRCM on Switch—have revealed the existence of project Juliet.

The studio releases a short, cinematic teaser with an emphasis on body horror—the ceremorphosis of an unwitting guard rendered in horrible, gory detail. Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh. But on the whole, Baldur's Gate 3 is a bright heroic fantasy with bloody dark spots—it's a colourful, lively game that (unless you kill everybody) is about troubled people overcoming their worst nature and horrifying fates to save the realm. The body horror in that original trailer is a theme, but it's on…",

Specifically, Altman signs his latest blog post off with these comments: \"Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I’m really proud of the trajectory the team has us on. We are seeing tremendous benefits in what people are doing with the technology already today, and we know there is much more coming over the next couple of years.\" It may seem convenient, trite, and not a little facetious to use PC gaming as a prism through which to view OpenAI. But it's actually a pretty handy starting point, not least because this is such a massive, unwieldy topic. So, anything that breaks it down into manageable chunks is very useful. Needless to say, OpenAI and its broader influence has been far from unambiguously beneficial for PC gamers.

The technology came out when I was still in school and today I'm at an age where buying a motor vehicle could be described as a midlife crisis. No, PhysX hasn't been relevant for a while. Or so I thought… Earlier this year, Nvidia pulled support for 32-bit CUDA applications with its newest generation graphics cards, the RTX 50 series. With it gone, it's no longer possible to natively run 32-bit games with hardware-accelerated PhysX effects. Why that matters: PhysX offers a way to run some in-game physics calculations on an add-in card . That not only frees up the CPU to focus on other things, it also allows developers to put a lot more physics-based effects into their games. As such, games with PhysX effects tend to have a lot of stuff going on. If you run a game with PhysX enabled but without the hardware to accelerate it then all of the physics calculations fall on your CPU. Even on today's much faster processors, with many more cores than those around during PhysX's peak, the impact of these added effects severely limits frame rate. The CPU becomes a bottleneck. Or you turn PhysX off. Now, I'll admit, I hadn't thought about Ph…",

But now the community has decided that Arc Raiders has a different kind of matchmaking. I've dubbed it 'aggression-based matchmaking', and it's the phenomenon that players have noticed for quite some time now, where those who don't engage in PvP get put in chill lobbies, whereas players who shoot on sight get placed in super aggressive lobbies. (Image credit: Embark) I first noticed this a few weeks ago. For the most part, I had been very chill in solo lobbies, just going in to loot or even team up with strangers to take down bigger arcs. It was a great experience, and the sense of camaraderie here was unmatched. But then, on one fateful day, I decided to shoot someone in a solo lobby. I ended up killing them, and my fate was sealed. From here on out, everything changed. I'd get shot in the back of the head before I even clocked another raider. Gone were my team-ups of old—I couldn't even talk to anyone, as the whole lobby was just shoot on sight. Now, my ex…",

Engelmayer said during the sentencing (via CNBC ), \"there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have, Mr. Kwon.\" TerraUSD and Luna collapsed in May 2022. TerraUSD was a so-called stablecoin for its intrinsic tie to the value of the US dollar. Intended to always be valued at $1 per coin, the foundations of the stablecoin were complex and shaky. It relied on protocols, a separate counter-token called Luna, and an exchange for burning/minting tokens to maintain the price of TerraUSD at $1. Failed attempts to prop up the system and mislead investors using secret funds eventually led to the collapse of both TerraUSD and Luna, from $1 and $87 on May 5, to $0.2 and $0.00005 on May 13 . \"In fact, core Terraform products did not work as Kwon advertised and were manipulated to create the illusion of a functioning and decentralized financial syste…",

Developer Sandfall Interactive is so happy, in fact, that it just decided to do the developer equivalent of blowing a kiss: The \"Thank you\" update —that is literally what it's called—adds a bunch of content to the game for the low low price of 'nothin' but disk space', as seen in the trailer below. The full patch notes go into greater detail—I'll rattle off the smaller bits first before we get into the real meat, but to summarise: There's a photo mode, now; You can save \"up to 50 different lumina loadouts\", which is a tremendous quality of life improvement, and there are new filters for them. Lastly, you can abandon battles, rather than simply waiting to die if you messed up. I cannot understate how hyped I am for that lumina loadout detail. I'd estimate a good four to five hours of my 67 hour playtime in Clair Obscur was spent just messing around with my pictos in menus—and it was always agony when a singular fight forced me to custom-tun…",

As usual, some of the biggest announcements leaked in the few days (or hours) before the show, but this year had several big announcements that we're actually excited about—not just re-releases of remasters. We got the reveal of Larian's next game, the Star Wars game we have been looking for, and a big new Total War announcement. Here are the biggest announcements you won't want to have missed from The Game Awards 2025: Larian is making a new Divinity game The leaks won out and now we know what Larian's next big RPG is going to be: Divinity. No, it isn't Divinity: Original Sin 3. No it isn't a remake of the first game in the series, which was actually called Divine Divinity. This one is Divinity—just Divinity .

The trailer features VO from (presumably) some manner of fucko alien complaining about how namby pamby, politically correct, Empire-era emissions and engine size standards ruined speeder racing. But now with the antiwoke New Republic and its gutting of the relevant regulatory bodies, we're returning to \"massive engine, lightning fast, lives on the line\" speeder races. Speeder racing's inevitable reckoning with driver mortality aside, the racing in question looks sick as hell, with a real sense of speed and great use of scenic Star Wars vistas throughout the trailer. I mean, your graphics are certainly pretty enough: Get the handling right, and bing bang boom, that's a Star Wars racing game I'd play.

Conversations spanning multiple languages, yet everyone seems to understand each other? Teams of three, not unlike a certain King of Fighters? Turns out my vibes were not misplaced, if chatting with game director Federico Cardini is anything to go by.

Peeled away from more realistic pastures for a neon-lit anime bonanza, heavily-modded cars and the unusual decision to put narrative at the centre of its arcade racing. On paper, it looks wildly unlike the games that came before it. But as Game Director Federico Cardini tells me, Milestone hasn't forgotten its roots. I asked about some of the more negative reaction to the revival, namely from people who played the originals and weren't happy with the new direction. \"I completely understand their opinion,\" Cardini said. \"It's something we ourselves struggled with at the very beginning.

If all you know about Warframe is that it's a game with space ninjas, the relentless Wagnerian intensity of a Herzog monologue might feel like a strange fit. But Warframe is beautifully, uncannily strange. As Herzog says during the magnificent work of advertising, Warframe is a story about beings \"cursed to walk this senseless universe in living metal, haunted by dreams.\" Warframes are an open question about identity, humanity, and utility. They are a riddle cast in razor iron and warped, quivering meat. They are weapons 3D printed from muscle memory, psychic imprint, and arcane force. They can get pregnant.

I spoke to Neon Giant heads Arcade Berg and Tor Frick again last week, and can add a little more context to the trailer.

The studio is calling No Law a \"first-person open world shooter RPG.\" \"You have experience points and skill trees, and you opt into how you want to play the game,\" said Berg. \"Do you want to be more into lockpicking, or do you want to be a hacker, or do you want to be a specialist with certain types of weapons … We never tell you which route to take, we say that the player can…",

With the help of a cheeky little shoulder arm, our protagonist proceeds to do survival game stuff: Hunting, gathering, but no tree punching, which is a welcome relief. The sci-fi vibe really has me intrigued: The planet's swampy and foreboding, with that grey-blue, clammy, soaked-through on a rainy day look of Death Stranding.

Bison), Cody Rhodes (Guile), Andrew Schulz (Dan Hibiki), Vidyut Jammwal (Dhalsim), Orville Peck (Vega), Olivier Richters (Zangief), Rayna Vallandingham (Juli), Mel Jarnson (Cammy), and yup, Jason Momoa (Blanka). Wow. Plus, some of those dudes are so big they should really count as two people. Is it a little weird to have that many people present one award? Sure. The award went to No Man's Sky, by the way, which doesn't feel weird at all. It simply is the best ongoing game. Oh, yeah, while the cast was there, they also showed off a sneak peak of the Street Fighter movie. …",

Blow and the devs at his studio, Thekla, have been working on it for 10 years, they created a new engine and new programming language, he reckons you could put 500+ hours into its 1000+ \"handcrafted\" puzzles, and the sell-it-to-me-in-a-sentence elevator pitch is that it's a \"game design supercollider.\" Oh, and yes, there will absolutely be philosophy scattered throughout.

Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis promises a \"stunning re-imagining\" of Lara Croft's first adventure from nearly 30 years ago, with updates graphics and gameplay, and \"new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.\" Narratively at least, the remake seems to be treated as sort of a recollection of years past, which presumably opens the door to previously unseen events and action. The announcement also finally gives us our first live look at the \"Unified Lara\" character design revealed in early 2024, a blend of the OG and her more modern look, last seen in 2018. This will be the second remake of the original Tomb Raider, following the serviceable but largely unremarkable Tomb Raider: Anniversary . But that was 18 years ago, and I'd say that's more than enough time passed to allow for a new shot at it. The bigger deal, though, is Tomb Raider: Catalyst.

Dylan, seemingly now free of the influence of the Hiss, has been deployed by the FBC to combat a new supernatural disaster—namely, reality-warping forces that have spilled out of the Oldest House and into the outside world, twisting an entire city into new forms.

The big twist, though, is the appearance of Leon as a playable character: Until now, Capcom has insisted that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, but it seems that Leon will be playing a significant role as well. But not the same kind of role as Grace: She will center on Resident Evil: Requiem's survival horror gameplay, while Leon will be all about the \"explosive action.\" And hoo boy does it look good: The trailer showed a brief snippet of over the shoulder shooting, as well as some of Leon's signature melee combos: That roundhouse kick fired off deeply buried synapses in my brain.
