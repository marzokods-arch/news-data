We got the reveal of Larian's next game, the Star Wars game we have been looking for, and a big new Total War announcement. Here are the biggest announcements you won't want to have missed from The Game Awards 2025: Larian is making a new Divinity game The leaks won out and now we know what Larian's next big RPG is going to be: Divinity. No, it isn't Divinity: Original Sin 3. No it isn't a remake of the first game in the series, which was actually called Divine Divinity. This one is Divinity—just Divinity .

To my knowledge, this is the first dedicated Star Wars racing game we've seen since the salad days of Prequel Trilogy tie-ins like the much(?) beloved Episode 1 Racer. The trailer features VO from (presumably) some manner of fucko alien complaining about how namby pamby, politically correct, Empire-era emissions and engine size standards ruined speeder racing. But now with the antiwoke New Republic and its gutting of the relevant regulatory bodies, we're returning to \"massive engine, lightning fast, lives on the line\" speeder races. Speeder racing's inevitable reckoning with driver mortality aside, the racing in question looks sick as hell, with a real sense of speed and great use of scenic Star Wars vistas throughout the trailer. I mean, your graphics are certainly pretty enough: Get the handling right, and bing bang boom, that's a Star Wars racing game I'd play. What will really seal the deal for me is some kind of campaign or otherwise toothsome singleplayer structure, which remains an open question at the moment. Galactic Racer's Steam page describes it as a \"runs-ba…",

Kind of in the way two guys with meticulously groomed moustaches will give a knowing nod when they walk past each other in the street. Upon watching arcade racer Screamer's latest narrative-focused trailer at The Game Awards, the first thing I thought to myself was, \"Huh, this absolutely feels like a fighting game.\" A tournament bringing unlikely individuals together in the pursuit of a larger, evil entity? Conversations spanning multiple languages, yet everyone seems to understand each other? Teams of three, not unlike a certain King of Fighters? Turns out my vibes were not misplaced, if chatting with game director Federico Cardini is anything to go by. Milestone's \"love of Japanese animation and fighting games\" did a lot of heavy lifting in influencing Screamer's story and overall tone. \"I am personally a Street Fighter player,\" Cardini tells me. \"Our creative director, Michele [Caletti], is a super fan of King of Fighters.

The new Screamer—set to launch next year—has a very different vibe to its '90s predecessors. Peeled away from more realistic pastures for a neon-lit anime bonanza, heavily-modded cars and the unusual decision to put narrative at the centre of its arcade racing. On paper, it looks wildly unlike the games that came before it. But as Game Director Federico Cardini tells me, Milestone hasn't forgotten its roots. I asked about some of the more negative reaction to the revival, namely from people who played the originals and weren't happy with the new direction. \"I completely understand their opinion,\" Cardini said. \"It's something we ourselves struggled with at the very beginning.

If all you know about Warframe is that it's a game with space ninjas, the relentless Wagnerian intensity of a Herzog monologue might feel like a strange fit. But Warframe is beautifully, uncannily strange. As Herzog says during the magnificent work of advertising, Warframe is a story about beings \"cursed to walk this senseless universe in living metal, haunted by dreams.\" Warframes are an open question about identity, humanity, and utility. They are a riddle cast in razor iron and warped, quivering meat. They are weapons 3D printed from muscle memory, psychic imprint, and arcane force. They can get pregnant.

I spoke to Neon Giant heads Arcade Berg and Tor Frick again last week, and can add a little more context to the trailer. The gameplay we see in the video reminds me of Bulletstorm—big kicks, exploding heads, lots of shooting—but we also spy some sneaky assassinations, so it isn't entirely about blowing stuff up. The studio is calling No Law a \"first-person open world shooter RPG.\" \"You have experience points and skill trees, and you opt into how you want to play the game,\" said Berg. \"Do you want to be more into lockpicking, or do you want to be a hacker, or do you want to be a specialist with certain types of weapons … We never tell you which route to take, we say that the player can…",

Forest 3's trailer begins with a first person view of a starship cockpit before something goes horribly awry and we careen impossibly far away from Earth at breakneck speeds. With the help of a cheeky little shoulder arm, our protagonist proceeds to do survival game stuff: Hunting, gathering, but no tree punching, which is a welcome relief. The sci-fi vibe really has me intrigued: The planet's swampy and foreboding, with that grey-blue, clammy, soaked-through on a rainy day look of Death Stranding.

They're the kind of things that simply wouldn't work in the game it used to be. A great example of this are loot filters, which are finally coming in Lord of Hatred.

To break it down: It's not a third-person shooter—it's a melee-focused \"action-RPG\". It's not set in the Oldest House, but instead an open world New York. It doesn't star Jesse Faden—you play as her brother, Dylan, who was the first game's villain. Perhaps appropriate, then, that it's not called Control 2—it's Control Resonant—though it does seem to follow on from the events of the first game. Dylan, seemingly now free of the influence of the Hiss, has been deployed by the FBC to combat a new supernatural disaster—namely, reality-warping forces that have spilled out of the Oldest House and into the outside world, twisting an entire city into new forms. Where Jesse wielded the Service Weapon, able to transform into a variety of different guns, Dylan instead has the Aberrant, an artifact that frankly looks like a cursed crowbar. It too can shapeshift, but into a selection of melee weapons, including an enormous…",

The trailer showcased large, angry, heavily bespectacled bad guy Victor Gideon, apparently a once-respected doctor who sure seems to be having a rough time of things more recently. The big twist, though, is the appearance of Leon as a playable character: Until now, Capcom has insisted that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, but it seems that Leon will be playing a significant role as well. But not the same kind of role as Grace: She will center on Resident Evil: Requiem's survival horror gameplay, while Leon will be all about the \"explosive action.\" And hoo boy does it look good: The trailer showed a brief snippet of over the shoulder shooting, as well as some of Leon's signature melee combos: That roundhouse kick fired off deeply buried synapses in my brain. In a delightful twist, after getting chased by another big guy with a chainsaw again, Leon flips the script, steals it, and turns it on his enemies—no more Dr. Salvador …",

And the idea of playing a Faust-like character who gets their magical abilities from a pact with a supernatural entity is an intriguing one. \"Warlocks, they make a dangerous pact with a powerful being, and really what it is is they have insanely high charisma.

    "body": "Like a large jaw with a preternaturally strong grip on the teeth it contains, Rockstar has let slip another half-detail about its reasons for firing more than 30 people in October , telling IGN that they were let go for revealing details about games that haven't even been announced yet. It's been a very slow roll since the firings were first revealed. Rockstar denied allegations that it fired the employees because they were attempting to form a union at the studio, saying initially that they were let go for \"gross misconduct,\" which it later elaborated to mean they had been \" distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.\" That denial didn't hold water with the fired employees and the Independent Workers' of Great Britain (IWGB) union, which filed legal action against Rockstar in November. November also saw the matter brought up in UK Parliament , as Edinburgh West MP Christine Jardine asked for a meeting with the relevant government minister \"to discuss what steps could be taken to support the workforce?\" The pressure on Rockstar went up significantly yesterday when the matter was raised in Parliament again, this time during Prime Minister's Questions, le…",

But the decisions the company makes about the mode, including the most recent update, are often not in support of that goal. Players level up their strength so fast and so far in Remix that they're ridiculously overpowered, tackling even the toughest group content in the game solo, romping through old dungeons and raids as if they were new-player zones. In the current Legion Remix, players are called Timerunners, and the same buff they build up to become OP levelers and fighters also gives them a speed buff—they literally dash everywhere they go.

Case in point, the Zotac Magnus EN mini workstation with RTX 5060 Ti, which seems to power that GPU via the PCIe connector, and not in the same way as Asus BTF cards and motherboards. The mini PC was disassembled and inspected by HKEPC , then brought to my attention by Unikoshardware and Wccftech . Apart from how impressive it is to be able to fit a discrete desktop RTX 5060 Ti into such a small chassis at all, one thing that sticks out is the complete lack of a power cable for the GPU. Looking at GPU-Z shows something interesting: \"Bus interface: PCIe x8 5.0 @ x8 5.0.\" Normally, for an RTX 5060 Ti, it would just show x 5.0. While I'm not sure what the \"@\" is all about, that's basically hinting that the x16 PCIe fingers are split into two batches of x8. And upon closer inspection of the graphics card, it is in fact split in two. As Uniko and Wccf point out, the split-off part gets fed a 19 V input, as they're not being used for…",

Ayaneo had previously teased this gaming-geared phone early last month . Now, there's a fresh blog post in Ayaneo's typically effusive style about the Pocket Play, plus a Kickstarter page . However, tech specs remain thin on the ground. We don't yet know what processor this bad boy will end up boasting, or even the device's display dimensions. However, given that Ayaneo is known for Android-based gaming handhelds such as the Snapdragon-based Ayaneo Pocket S , perhaps I won't need all three guesses to figure out this phone's headlining hardware specs. So, like most of its ilk, it will likely be an Android device. That means we won't be able to play our precious PC games on it without an emulator, such as Winlator, which is a bit of a job to set up. At least other forms of Android emulation are generally excellent these days. Though there's no gesture at a release window beyond the words 'coming soon,' I'm already intrigued.

I joke (kind of), this small update dishes out some fixes for maps like Stella Montis and Blue Gate, as well as notifying us of some upcoming changes to the update schedule. Patch 1.6.0 targets four specific issues: Removing the zipline on Stella Montis that lets players go out of bounds. Fixing a collision that let players get through a wall in Blue Gate. Fixing material issues, which meant bullets or arcs' vision weren't blocked by some objects. Patching a gap at the Spaceport Launch Tower, which allowed players to get shot through a wall. I've had a couple of problems here and there with arc's vision or bullets not properly being blocked, although I chalked up my issues to the character movement latency that plagued my games at launch. Although this was fixed a month ago and I haven't had any issues since then. I'm also sad to see another wall exploit kick the bucket after the infamous door glitch was patched out , but I suppose it's for the best. \"We also want to give you a quick update on the patch cadence in the com…",

For example: Disney's Lorcana once had a combo with minor character Hiram Flaversham that elevated him to godhood via banishing and re-summoning a popsicle. Now a new sentence has emerged: Magic: The Gathering's new Marvel set has a combo where you make the Incredible Hulk so, so very angry by forcing the poor guy to step on spiky caltrops over and over and over again, hurting his poor feetsies. As spotted by Wargamer , you do need to put in a little work here—the card starts off as an un-crashed out Bruce Banner that has to be transformed with six mana. Once he's all green'd up, though, there's a crucial bit of rules text: \"Enrage—Whenever The Incredible Hulk is dealt damage, put a +1/+1 counter on him. If he's attacking, untap him and there is an additional combat phase after this phase.\" Combine this with Caltrops, which deals one damage when a creature attacks, and you start to see the vision: The Hulk crashes into an enemy, roaring, frothing at the mouth.

The yearly Call of Duty game is such a calcified constant of our hobby that, at some point, the people who used to say \"they should stop making CoD every single year\" just sorta gave up and accepted that series is as inevitable as back pain. We pleaded to Activision to take a break, made our case that the 12-month cycle was unsustainable and diminishing, and Activision responded by doing the exact opposite for going on 20 years. With the sort of \"milk it dry\" hubris that defined the Bobby Kotick era of Activision, the megapublisher decided it could outpace CoD burnout— outrun diminishing returns—by tripling down. More studios, more bodies, more CoD. CoD but battle royale. CoD zombies. CoD extraction. CoD on your phone. CoD but battle royale, but on your phone.

This matched my own experience with the game back then. The enticing promise of a full and faithful digital recreation of D&D's 3.5 ruleset—and a chance to throw magic missiles somewhere other than the Sword Coast thanks to the game's use of the Greyhawk setting—was brought down by frustrating technical issues and odd design choices.
