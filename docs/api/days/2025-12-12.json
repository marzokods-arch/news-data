    "body": "TL;DR Android is getting a quality-of-life update that automatically turns on wireless debugging when connected to trusted Wi-Fi networks. Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR Due to soaring RAM prices, smartphones in 2026 are expected to be more expensive while featuring less RAM than 2025 models. High-end 16GB RAM models may nearly disappear, and 12GB and 8GB models could see massive reductions in availability as makers revert to 8GB and 4GB RAM, respectively. Phone makers are caught between pricing pressures and reduced availability of consumer-grade DRAM as RAM manufacturers prioritize HBM supply for enterprise customers. 2026 isn’t shaping up to be a good year to buy a new phone, or any new tech in general. We’ve heard reports that phones are about to become more expensive due to RAM inflation . Now, new reports suggest that phone specs could actually start going backwards because of RAM inflation.

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Google is bringing a key Pixel 10 Pro Fold feature to the older Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In the Camera app, you can now use half of the screen to view recently captured images. The option has been available on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold since launch. I find foldables to be the ultimate productivity boosters . Not only does the extra real estate on the inner screen allow more content to be viewed at once, which can be helpful for reading, but it also serves what would typically require two screens. Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature. Meanwhile, Google only added it to its foldable lineup recently with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold , and the feature has been exclusive to it since launch. Thankfully, t…",

To make this part of the year easier for me, I have a list of tech products I regularly gift to people. These are products that just about anyone would be happy to get, ranging from about $10 to $110.

    "summary": "This tiny ultra-short-throw still delivers a 100-inch image from inches away.",
    "body": "TL;DR JMGO has launched the JMGO O3, a compact and affordable ultra-short-throw (UST) laser projector. The unit is just 250 × 219 × 107mm and 2.4kg, far smaller than the O2S Ultra. It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",

The deluge was the result of a potent atmospheric river that took aim at the region starting around December 7. Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow bands of moisture that move like rivers in the sky, transporting water vapor from the tropics toward the poles. They occur around the planet, most often in autumn and winter, with the U.S. West Coast typically affected by moist air that originates near Hawaii. In this event, however, some of the moisture arrived from even farther away, originating roughly 7,000 miles (11,000 kilometers) across the Pacific from near the Philippines .

The proposed CINEMA mission aims to advance our understanding of how plasma energy flows into the Earth&#8217;s magnetosphere. This highly dynamic convective flow is unpredictable — sometimes steady and sometimes explosive — driving phenomena like fast plasma jets, global electrical current systems, and spectacular auroral displays. “The CINEMA mission will help us to research magnetic convection in Earth’s magnetosphere — a critical piece of the puzzle in understanding why some space weather events are so influential, such as causing magnificent aurora displays and impacts to ground- and space-based infrastructure, and others seem to fizzle out,” said Joe Westlake, director…",

    "body": "TL;DR Disney has formally demanded Google stop allowing Disney characters to appear in AI images and videos. This comes as Disney and OpenAI have announced a licensing deal that sees Disney acquire a $1 billion stake in OpenAI. Google has not responded to request for comment. Earlier today, OpenAI announced a major deal with Disney that will allow ChatGPT and Sora to create officially licensed, AI-generated imagery featuring the media giant’s popular characters. Now, Disney wants to stop another leading AI provider from doing the same. Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, accusing the company of copyright infringement in Gemini output. Variety reports that in a letter reviewed by the publication, Disney’s lawyers accuse Google of infringing on Disney’s copyrights “on a massive scale,” citing Gemini’s ability to create imagery that includes copyrighted characters from across Disney’s expansive catalog of intellectual properties. Disney has apparently been informally communicating with Google about this for some time, but as of today, Gemini still readily produces imagery featuring Disney’s characters.",

A selection of Sora-generated video content is coming to the Disney+ app. The deal will see Disney purchase equity in OpenAI, making it part owner. Disney has been pretty litigious when it comes to AI platforms appropriating its intellectual property. In June, the company sued AI image generator Midjourney , seeking to stop the platform from creating images using characters from its IPs. Then, in September, it sent a cease-and-desist to AI chatbot provider Character.AI, again citing the platform’s unauthorized use of its characters. But now, ChatGPT developer OpenAI has announced that its products will soon be able to create images and videos of all your favorite Disney characters — with Disney’s blessing. OpenAI detailed the arrangement in a blog post this morning. Disney and OpenAI are partnering up to allow both ChatGPT Images and Sora to generate content containing characters, props, locations, and more from Disney’s vast IP empire, which includes Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, beginning early next year.",

Like a toddler, our Sun occasionally has disruptive outbursts. But instead of throwing a fit, the Sun spews magnetized material and hazardous high-energy particles that drive space weather as they travel across the solar system. These outbursts can impact our daily lives, from disrupting technologies like GPS to triggering power outages, and they can also imperil voyaging astronauts and spacecraft. Understanding how these solar outbursts, called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), occur and where they are headed is essential to predicting and preparing for their impacts at Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Images taken by Parker Solar Probe in December 2024, and published Thursday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters , have revealed that not all magnetic material in a CME escapes the Sun — some makes it back, changing the shape of the solar atmosphere in subt…",

    "summary": "Like other foldables, the Galaxy Z TriFold lets you transition apps from the cover to the main screen, but there’s a catch.",
    "body": "TL;DR Enabling App Continuity on the Galaxy Z TriFold causes the device to lower the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen. Samsung lowers the cover screen’s rendering resolution to match the inner screen’s pixel density so apps don’t restart when unfolding. A hardware upscaler keeps the display looking sharp, but screenshots capture the raw, lower-resolution image before it is processed. Like most foldable phones , the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold sports two displays: an outer cover screen and an inner main screen. What makes the TriFold unique is that its inner screen folds twice, giving the device its signature look. In most other respects, though, the TriFold behaves like any other Samsung foldable. It supports App Continuity, for example, allowing you to seamlessly transition apps from the cover to the main screen. However, this feature causes an interesting quirk on the TriFold: it compromises the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen — but for good reason.

If you have a Samsung phone running the One UI 8.5 beta , that’s now possible thanks to Samsung’s new “Block apps with excessive ads” setting. It’s buried deep in One UI 8.5, but it could very well be the update’s best-kept secret. Here’s how to find and use it.",

Specs have not been revealed, but it will launch via Kickstarter. More than four months after AYANEO first announced it was working on a phone, the company has finally revealed the design. As expected, it’s a modern take on the Xperia Play, incorporating not just the design language, but also the name. The AYANEO Pocket PLAY is a modern take on the ill-fated Sony Ericsson handheld, with a sliding design that will take you right back to 2011. Several other recent devices like the ANBERNIC RG Slide and the magnetic MCON controller also incorporate sliding mechanisms, but this is the first sliding gaming phone released in nearly 15 years.",

The feature now lets you record only a portion of the screen, rather than the entire screen. However, it’s currently slightly challenging to work with, especially if you use swipe gestures for navigation, and we hope Samsung fixes it. After months of leaks, Samsung’s next big update, One UI 8.5, is finally ready for beta testing. And it brings a highly modified interface that could spark opinions about drawing inspiration from Apple’s iOS 26 . But in addition to the renewed system UI and apps, One UI 8.5 is also bringing improvements to key functionalities, and one of them is how screen recording works. With Samsung’s first official One UI 8.5 beta build released, we’re now seeing a new menu for screen recording features. One of the chief changes is the ability to record only a part of the screen instead of the entire screen, which is easier than cropping the video later.",

    "body": "TL;DR Motorola foldable phones to date have all been of the vertical-opening “clamshell” variety. In a holiday gift pack, the company teases its CES event with a notebook featuring “fold” language. A notecard further teases “new perspectives,” which could hint at a horizontally oriented foldable. Foldable smartphones may all rely on the same basic flexible-display trick, but how manufacturers go about designing them still varies wildly — and things are only getting more complicated as we move further into the dual-fold era with devices like the (incredibly poorly named) Galaxy Z TriFold . So far, Motorola has only produced foldables of the same vertically unfolding variety, but a potential teaser might just hint at a new direction — literally.

Starting in early 2026, the service will move away from its one-size-fits-everything model and roll out a lineup of à-la-carte plans built around what people actually watch .

The RAM on the Homey Pro has been updated from 2GB to 4GB, now allowing it to run even more apps and workflows. The Homey Pro (2026) still costs the same, which isn’t very affordable, but it’s worth the investment, given its support lasts through 2031. Anyone who’s dabbled with smart home products from multiple brands will know what a mess it is. Different protocols, different apps, and each one requires signing up for a new account, just so you can turn a light on or off without getting out of bed. Thankfully, certain devices, including Homey, aim to address this fragmentation by serving as a single hub to control all your devices from a central location. When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house. And now that the device is getting a newer model that’s ready for 2026, we expect similar performance, given its key upgrade.

Earlier this week, Google showed us a glimpse of what Android XR could look like without bulky glasses covering up a part of your face. These will be light-use glasses that complement, rather than replace, standalone headsets such as the Galaxy XR. In the meantime, tethered glasses that serve as extended displays for devices such as handheld gaming devices, laptops, or iPads are increasingly popular. VITURE is already flourishing in this segment, with more than 50% of the market share in the US. And today, it is bringing a (sort of) new product, marking its fondness for gamers. VITURE has announced a special edition of its Luma XR glasses to mark the fifth anniversary of Cyberpunk 2077’s release.

This new API allows the default launcher to lock apps, eliminating the need to use third-party app lockers. We spotted code for this feature in a recent Android Canary build, though it isn’t expected to officially launch until next year’s major update. People store a lot of sensitive data on their Android phones , so it’s no wonder they are reluctant to hand them over to anyone they don’t trust. Even if you are comfortable letting a friend or family member borrow your device, you probably still have data you don’t want them to see. Locking down specific apps is a great way to protect your privacy, but the core Android OS still lacks a native way to do this, forcing many users — especially of Pixel devices — to rely on third-party tools. Fortunately, Google may finally address this in next year’s Android 17 update by adding a new App Lock feature.

But, as it turns out, lots of others are using it in all sorts of ways. A recent Reddit thread asking how the thermometer “contributes to your life” spiralled into an interesting catalogue of real-world uses, from checking toddler fevers to proving a hotel room’s AC was broken. That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home .

Specifically, how much One UI 8.5 makes my Samsung phone feel like an iPhone.",

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR Leaker Evan Blass shared a Verizon certification for the Pixel 10a, revealing a 6.3-inch display and 5,100mAh battery. Most listed specs match the Pixel 9a. The listing confirms the codename “STA5” (Stallion) and describes the device as bringing Google AI at a great value. The Pixel 10 series dominated conversations after its launch, but it’s time to look forward to Google’s next phone release. The Pixel 10a is expected to be released next year, and while we’ve seen renders , there has been a surprising lack of leaks around its specifications and other details. That changes now, as a new leak is shedding light on key Pixel 10a specifications. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
