    "body": "TL;DR When Nuki launched its Smart Lock in the US, in introduced a $5.90/month Nuki Premium subscription. Some critical connectivity features like Wi-Fi support and notifications were paywalled behind Premium. Nuki has now decided to do away with Premium subscriptions, instead selling the Smart Lock for a slightly higher upfront cost. Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference. And today we’ve got a critical update on that. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Google has quietly removed the option to call your smart displays from the Google Home app on your phone. The “Call Home” feature allowed you to call the smart display from your phone while using the same Google account. A Redditor noted the option has vanished from the app following the recent redesign. The other alternative is to call other users over Meet, but it requires their accounts to be added to the display as well. In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language. Now that Meet has replaced Duo, Google seems to be killing the option to call your home devices. As noted by Reddit user chelitazz , Google appears to have removed the “Call Home” button from the Google Home app on Android.

The app creates a Wi-Fi file server, allowing you to transfer APK files from a phone or PC browser and install them directly on the watch. This is a paid application that also serves as a file manager. If you use a Wear OS smartwatch with your Android flagship, chances are that you’ve been tempted by the newer watch faces that Google has released for the Pixel Watch 4 . It’s possible to install these watch faces on other watches, but you need to know how to sideload using ADB on your smartwatch. While the process is straightforward if you can follow a guide , it’s admittedly still a bit too complicated for the average user. Thankfully, there’s a new app on the block that makes it easy to install APK files on your smartwatch, while also offering file manager functionality.

The feature was introduced in Android 16 DP2 for the Pixel 9 series, but later expanded to older Pixel models. It was mysteriously removed in subsequent Android 16 betas, but the latest stable QPR2 update reinstates it on the Pixel 9 and above. Android’s latest update is quietly bringing back a useful fingerprint unlocking option to Pixel phones. The Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock toggle has returned in the new Android 16 QPR2 update , a.k.a the second major Android 16 update of the year . Enabling the feature lets users unlock their Pixels with the fingerprint sensor even when the display is completely off. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

While technically classified as a minor update, it’s anything but; it brings a wealth of new customization options, productivity features, security improvements, and developer APIs. Following the release, we wondered when Google would share the source code.

This feature can force dark mode in apps that don’t natively support dark mode in the first place. The expanded dark mode will arrive on eligible Pixel phones today. Dark mode is one of the more popular features on smartphones today, giving users a system-wide color theme that’s easier on the eyes in some situations. This feature isn’t perfect when it comes to third-party Android apps, though, as some apps simply lack a dark mode. Fortunately, Google has now introduced a handy tweak. Google has announced a slew of Android 16 updates, including an expanded dark mode option. This can force dark mode in apps that don’t actually have a dark theme in the first place.",

The image from Android Headlines reveals a triple-camera setup, an extra side button, and a grippy-looking back, but no view of the front display. Other recent leaks suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1.5K OLED screen. Motorola just rolled out the Edge 70 in global markets, but the company clearly isn’t slowing down. A new render shows what’s purported to be the first official image of the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra, hinting at where the next flagship is headed. The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70. The Motorola logo sits in the middle and seems to blend with each color, and the back texture looks more like something meant to add grip than decoration.",

Claims can be filed online with a Class Member ID or by mailing a printed form, and payments are expected in early to mid-2026. We first reported on a major AT&amp;T data breach settlement back in August , which at the time was set to pay up to $177 million in total, with impacted customers able to claim upwards of $5,000. While this was originally supposed to happen back in November, it seems the dates and planned payouts have shifted a bit.

This move contradicts Google’s previous rejection of a similar user request, where the company cited security risks and the sensitive nature of PII as reasons to keep the IMEI hidden on locked devices. While the feature could help law enforcement return lost or stolen devices without seizing or wiping data, it raises concerns that malicious actors could misuse the easily accessible identifier. Every single phone, Android or otherwise, has an IMEI number . The IMEI number is a unique identifier that identifies a device on a mobile network, much like a personal identification number. It’s generally a good idea not to reveal or broadcast your phone’s IMEI number, just to avoid sharing it with malicious actors. However, there are situations where easier access to a phone’s IMEI number might have been useful.

In fact, I originally switched to Android (Google Pixel 2 XL “panda edition,” which is still one of my favorite designs) specifically because I liked the images that Google’s camera app produced. Year over year, camera upgrades brought significant upgrades that — for me, at least — warranted buying a new phone each year. But in more recent years, the improvements have been less dramatic and, in many cases, not very noticeable to the average user. As someone who has continued to upgrade most years, this made me wonder how Google’s latest device stacks up against one of its predecessors , so I decided to compare the Pixel 8 Pro to my latest Pixel 10 Pro . Let’s dig into the pixels to see how a two-year-old device stacks up against Google’s latest efforts. Are you sure we’re using two different devices? Let’s start with the main camera . The lens itself is identical on both devices, so in theory, the images should be relatively similar.",

A new chip on the playback screen appears when audio is enhanced with Clear Voice, allowing you to revert to the original audio if needed. Google added a Clear Voice toggle to the Recorder app for Pixels in December 2024, shortly after we had spotted the feature in development . Clear Voice reduces background noise during recording, making it quite handy for recordings.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Mobi, once seen as a stable Hawaii-based carrier, has collapsed amid severe internal problems. A lawsuit alleges the CEO withheld $1 million in wages and fired executives without authorization, followed by widespread service outages and reports of full service shutdowns. The CEO has reportedly fled to Brazil, and customers are struggling to recover account information or get clear answers on what is going on, making it urgent to transfer out as soon as possible. Last year, I wrote about a great new promotion from Mobi. At the time , I explained that this was an established carrier, even if most people have never heard of it, as its primary market is Hawaii. In my exact words, “Mobi is no fly-by-night operation, and you can absolutely trust them.” Welp, that didn’t age well. For years, Mobi was a trusted brand with a lot of potential, but suddenly it’s all come crashing down, as first reported by Fierce Network. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.
