Release date December 1, 2025 Expect to pay $30 / £25 Developer Tribute Games Inc Publisher Dotemu, Gamirror Games Reviewed on Nvidia Geforce RTX 3080, AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, 32GB RAM Steam Deck Playable Link Official site That this beat 'em up has a roster of 15 different playable Marvel superheroes is immediately impressive. But what's really amazing is every single one of them feels completely distinct, fun to play, and truly super . I just wish Marvel Cosmic Invasion offered more for them all to do. In the vein of developer Tribute Games' last game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, this is an unabashedly old school side-scroller. Bad guys appear, you punch them until they're all gone, then you move a bit further right and more bad guys appear. Repeat until you reach a boss fight. Simple, nostalgic, satisfying. (Image credit: Tribute Games Inc) But as in Shredder's Revenge, more modern ideas enhance the action. Blocks, parries, and dodges make it easier to stay on your feet than in the old classics, for example, and generous launchers and timing window…",

There's been the update that overhauled fighters and rangers , the one that gave you six more talent points , and that one that let you turn its spiders into orbs . But more is yet to come. And it was set to come, originally, this autumn, as part of the game's fall 2025 pitstop on its roadmap. \"If you’ve checked out a calendar you may have also noticed that fall is quickly running out,\" Obsidian wrote in an update for fans on its Discord. You can probably guess what that means: \"Avowed will not be receiving a fall update.\" There is an upside, though. To compensate for its tardiness, Obsidian is replacing the fall update with a one-year anniversary update, due this February, which will include all the stuff originally slated for autumn and some extra gubbins, too, making it \"the biggest update for the game yet.\" And if you think Obsidian deigned to detail just what those bonus features will contain, well, you might not …",

Reportedly, the OpenAI chief has called for staff to be pulled from other projects, including advertising, AI agents, and its forthcoming personal assistant, Pulse, in order to spruce up ChatGPT. The team behind the inordinately popular chatbot will also have to attend a daily meeting to report on their progress, which I can only imagine takes place in a ready room not far from the bridge. Futuristic red and gold uniforms, optional. The recent release of Google's Gemini 3 has been very well-received , and monthly active Gemini users are already reported to have grown from 450 million in July to 650 million this autumn. The new iteration of Gemini looks to best ChatGPT in several key areas, including critical analysis, strategic reasoning, and overall performance.

This is notable because Raspberry Pi SBCs (single-board computers) are normally very consistent in pricing. As the company points out, \"at $35, a 1GB Raspberry Pi 4 costs the same as a 256MB Raspberry Pi 1 from 2012.\" But now prices are being raised.

However, it's not just the chip that's greedy; the Ayeneo Next II's TDP is 85 W in order to feed an impressive list of tech specs. To begin with, there's the 9.06-inch OLED panel that features 2400 × 1504 resolution and enjoys up to 1100 nits of brightness. This screen also offers variable refresh rates, including options for 60 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz, 144 Hz, and 165 Hz. But even such a luscious screen is still just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg.

In an analyst note this week, Moorhead first said he was \"bullish\" about Intel's new 18A node, which is in production now and will first be seen in January underpinning Intel's next-gen Panther Lake CPUs . He then explained why things are also looking up for 14A. \"From everything I’ve seen—and all the Intel customers I’ve talked to—I’m very confident that Intel will use 18A to successfully produce tens of millions of leading-edge chips in the Panther Lake family and beyond in the near term.

Giant content delivery network (CDN) Cloudflare has released some somewhat troubling stats and info regarding the past year of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These are essentially attacks that attempt to flood a target service with packets of data to overload and overwhelm it and prevent it from doing the work it's actually meant to be doing, such as providing an internet connection to customers or displaying webpages. According to Cloudflare, DDoS attacks are up 170% to 36.2 million in 2025 compared to 2024. To zoom in a little, the company says that in the third quarter of 2025, it \"mitigated an average of 3,780 DDoS attacks every hour.\" That's 63 DDoS attacks each minute, or about one every second.

And while gaming mouse docks are often disregarded as a novelty or even a gimmick, it's hard to deny their practicality. I mean, plugging in ? In 2025? Why waste my energy on something so tedious? Thankfully, the MSI Versa Pro Wireless gaming mouse and Mouse Dock Pro are all about the path of least resistance. Since the world is now moving into some strange, AI-fuelled Edo period I'm betting the use of gaming mouse docks will start to see a resurgence, too. Alright, better prep yourself for further laziness productivity rants as we get into why the MSI Versa Pro Wireless and Mouse Dock Pro is quickly becoming my new favorite gaming accessory duo. Aside from the huge, lit-up logo and RGB-studded side panels there's a certain sleek simplicity to the Versa Pro and Mouse Dock Pro.

Its system requirements are so detailed that you'll probably be able to figure out the exact setting you'll be using the game, long before you get a chance to install it. You can check them out for yourself via Hypixel Studio's news post on the matter. Let's start with the good stuff to begin with, just as Hypixel does: listing the expected performance, graphics preset, and screen resolution for the minimum, recommended, and 'streamer' requirements. Specifically, it's 30 fps at 1080p Low for minimum, 60 fps at 1080p High for recommended, and \"stable framerate with high-quality video capture and streaming at 1440p\".

The cursed keebs in question are a line of wireless peripherals designed to give you an esports edge (via Videocardz ). How, you may be asking? By relegating key button presses to the domain of limbs you otherwise aren't using to game… is this what they call 'maximising efficiency'? So, picture this: rather than stretching your palms to reload or sprint, you could bind those commands to one of these under-the-desk peripherals instead. These cursed keebs come in three and four key versions, so the world's your oyster—or rather, foot pedal. Regardless of the button layout you go for, each 'key' is an ABS cap 25 mm in diameter, and features a Cherry MX Silent Black switch under the hood (or should that be 'under hoof'?).

However, the sheer size of the game now it has received three expansions, alongside all the unlockable biomes in the Dream Castle, means there's a lot more ground to cover. And frankly, running around on foot doesn't cut it. Of course, you can glide, but I don't keep on top of my stamina enough to constantly do that.

Most Wanted is a little bit special, because we ask our council of over 120 journalists, celebrities, content creators, and games industry experts to vote on our 100-game longlist to decide what the 25 Most Wanted games are. This year, longlisted games include huge titles like Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, Resident Evil Requiem, and 007 First Light, among others. Our council is no less impressive, with members such as Tanya Short, Martin Wahlund, Dave Oshry, Terry Crews, Caroline Marchal, and Devora Wilde all casting their opinions. Hosted by regular host and esports legend Frankie Ward, PC Gamer's own Midas, and with the vocal talents of Baldur's Gate 3 and Hades 2's Amelia Tyler, it's promising to be a good show.

If you need a refresher, here's a rundown of all eight episodes. Episode 1: The End In the year 2077, cowboy actor Cooper Howard performs with his daughter Janey at a birthday party. When Cooper refuses to do a thumbs-up his daughter asks why, and he explains that in the Marines they were taught to measure mushroom clouds with their thumbs—if it was bigger than their thumb it wasn't worth running away.

A breakdown of the ownership between these parties wasn't given at the time, but as it turns out, one is committing significantly more cash than the others.

Unlike real life, where logging on can feel like walking straight through the gates of hell, my first trip to the land of ones and zeros in Time Stranger is the happiest a game's made me all year. Beautifully paying off several slow burn hours spent exploring the hyper-modern cleanliness of Tokyo and its grungy concrete sewers, the so-called Digiworld is a joyous explosion of life, color, and personality. And it owes every ounce of that joy to its oddball citizens. Everywhere you look in Central Town, the digital city a large chunk of Time Stranger centers on—every nook and cranny and rooftop and window, inside every trashcan and on every discarded box, floating through the sky and crawling up power lines—are Digimon of every size and shape you could imagine. There’s the squishy Tanemon rushing in and out of a baby-sized door in the wall. Gekomon serenading a crowd. Literal Satan, Devimon, trying to relax with a cold one at the bar. It’s a place packed dense with nothing but great little guys, weirdo friends just waiting to be made, and its bustling energy perfectly captures wha…",

The Forsaken Hollows has more in it than FromSoft originally let on. Sure, you can play the new supportive scholar character or the aggressive nun with the hammer, but there's also new locations coming to the original Limveld map and a new shifting earth event that brings you to what is effectively an entirely separate landmass. For a $15 DLC, that's quite a lot—and that's not counting all the new items and monsters we haven't seen yet. I'm still crossing my fingers that we get those backhand blades .

It's a formula that took a while to cotton on outside of Japan: it didn't really land as a big commercial success in the west until 2015's Yakuza 0. And that game landed loudly, despite making no overt compromises for western audiences. But now that western audiences are paying attention, will Ryu Ga Gotoku indulge them more? It seems unlikely, according to a new Automaton interview with three RGG Studio big wigs. Asked whether the studio might abandon its credo of \"making what feels true to RGG Studio\" in the event that their games became huge global concerns, series executive producer Yokoyama Masayoshi was unequivocal. \"No, it won’t,\" he said. \"If we really wanted to make a game for overseas audiences, it would obviously be better to make a foreign protagonist and set the story overseas.

Publisher Santa Ragione said in a blog update that Epic informed it of the decision at 5 pm CET/11 am ET on December 1, saying the game violates its policies on \"inappropriate content\" and \"hateful or abusive content.\" Epic didn't tell Santa Ragione how exactly Horses violated its guidelines, according to an email from the publisher sent to PC Gamer, but only made what it described as \"broad and demonstrably incorrect claims\" about it. Santa Ragione filed an appeal, but it was rejected 12 hours later with no further explanation. Epic also indicated the game could be updated to bring it into compliance, but \"the email did not include any information on what would need to be changed,\" Santa Ragione said, and even if it had there'd be no way to make extensive changes one day ahead of release. Epic was not more forthcoming on the matter in a statement provided to PC Gamer. \"We set clear guidelines for the content that can be distributed on the Epic Games Store and found violati…",

But in the 10 years since Shovel Knight first appeared, developer Yacht Club Games has struggled to produce a full-on follow-up hit, and in a new interview with Bloomberg , studio founder Cris Velasco says it will be in serious trouble if its next game isn't a success. That 'next game' would be Mina the Hollower , a sort of gothic Link's Awakening that was revealed to the world in 2022 . \"It’s make-or-break for sure,\" Velasco said. \"If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good.\" Development of Mina the Hollower has been troubled, according to the interview. The game was proposed in 2019 and work began in earnest in early 2020, when Yacht Club split into two teams, one for the full-on Shovel Knight sequel—that 3D project we heard about back in 2020, apparently—and the other to handle Mina the Hollower, which was intended to be a sma…",

The OED defines \"rage bait\" thusly: \"Online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media account.\" So essentially the manipulative tactics deployed online by many unscrupulous publishers in order to get you mad, get you clicking, and get yo…",

That trilogy, now all bound-up as Hitman: World of Assassination, has a new upcoming collaboration with Eminem. This is another area where IO has expanded cleverly: choosing celebrities that are happy to become in-game \"elusive targets\" and building missions around their personae. Hitman is never going to be Fortnite, but these collabs make enormous sense and sprinkle a little something different (as well as stardust) around every so often.

Developer Battlestate Games confirmed on social media that Tigz was in fact the first to get the job done. A post shared by Escape from Tarkov (@escapefromtarkov) A photo posted by on When I first heard that someone had escaped from Tarkov, I immediately assumed someone was making a silly joke. The game's been out for eight years, after all, and if nobody's escaped yet, well, nobody's ever going to. But, as Tarkov aficionados are no doubt lining up to tell me, all of that time was spent in beta and early access: The full 1.0 release didn't happen until November 15 of this year, a major update that added—among other things—the \"non-linear story campaign and end-game content.\" So that's why it took so long for someone to …",

That means Monitors Unboxed isn't using it for gaming but the daily computing grind with lots of static content for eight hours a day. The channel also only runs MSI's OLED panel compensation cycle at the end of the eight hour working day, not at the four-hour intervals that MSI recommends. The idea, in other words, isn't to baby this monitor but use it just as you would an LCD panel. And you don't have to break off from work in the middle of the day for 10 minutes to run compensation cycles on LCD monitors.

The price change is reportedly at the distributor level, and therefore, down to those distributors to, well, distribute that price difference.

Since launch, you've had to dedicate hundreds of thousands of coins' worth of resources to building and supplying your caravan, with only a vague idea of what awaits you on the other side. Hell, all we really know is that you'll get an XP boost, enhanced Scrappy, an unknown amount of additional stash space, and bonus skill points based on the value of the items in your stash on the departure date (December 21). Don't ask me for specifics because, well, we don't have them. Only Embark does, and it's not telling. The only solace I can give you is that, in an update by community manager Lily on the Arc Raiders Discord server last week, it was confirmed that the \"skill point and stash space bonuses are permanent\". Additionally, they're based on your stash value and how much money you've got in your wallet at the time of departure. That's great news for anyone committing to the Expedition Project and, honestly, might be what tempts me to take the plunge. Each normal stash upgrade currently grants 24 slots, so my best guess is that the Expedition …",

According to Hong Kong hardware site, HKEPC , a number of Chinese media reports claim that major motherboard manufacturers—including MSI, Gigabyte, and Asus—have seen motherboard sales drop up to 50% compared to figures from November and December 2024. HKEPC suggests this drop in Motherboard sales is due to DRAM prices beginning to rise in October , putting off would-be PC upgraders at a time when we'd normally see a bunch of enthusiasts making new purchases. The report goes on to further predict that this will have a subsequent knock-on effect for CPU sales before long. HKEPC observes that gamers are spending their funds elsewhere, with sales figures for gaming peripherals (such as gaming mice and controllers) alongside monitors being much less affected.

SK Hynix, meanwhile, sounded a slightly more aggressive note in terms of investment in expanded production.
