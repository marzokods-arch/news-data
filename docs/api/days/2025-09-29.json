    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google is bringing its “collaborate with Gemini” tools in Drive to Android and iOS apps. The update lets you summarize documents, discuss topics, and pull facts across files on mobile. Rollout began on September 22, but it may not have reached all users yet. Google has been rolling Gemini features into Drive for a while now, from catching you up on file changes to summarizing meeting recordings. Until now, though, the “collaborate with Gemini” experience was limited to the web. That’s changing, with Google announcing the feature is now available in the Drive apps for Android and iOS. As detailed on the Workspace Updates blog , this integration brings the web experience to your phone. You’ll be able to ask Gemini to summarize long documents or even entire folders, pull out quick facts from across multiple files, or discuss a topic without manually digging through everything yourself.",

Researchers found that the tags broadcast an unencrypted MAC address and unique ID that other Bluetooth devices and antennas can pick up and track. The trackers also send unencrypted data to Tile’s servers, which the company could use to track the tags of owners. When you use a Bluetooth tracker , like Tile, you’re typically concerned about locating misplaced items. But maybe you should be more concerned about strangers tracking you. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have identified a few major security flaws in Tile trackers that stalkers could exploit to track your whereabouts.

    "body": "TL;DR Motorola has begun teasing a new flagship Android phone called the “Moto X70 Air,” with a full reveal coming later in October. Like the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air, the main draw to the Moto X70 Air will be its ultra-thin design. Currently, we expect the X70 Air to be released exclusively in China, although a global launch may occur at a later date. Thin smartphones are all the rage this year. After Samsung kickstarted the trend earlier this year, and Apple just brought it back into the spotlight, it appears that Motorola is the next company to throw its hat into the thin phone ring. The official Motorola account on Weibo recently published a teaser image for the Moto X70 Air, and it takes just one look to see that this is a phone designed to compete with the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air . Not only does the Moto X70 Air name give it away, but the image of the phone shows someone holding a handset that looks every bit as thin as Samsung and Apple’s recent launches.",

We liked the headset quite a bit, but at an MSRP of $299, it’s pretty unequivocally a luxury item. Today, Nothing’s budget sub-brand, CMF, has launched its own pair of over-ears — and they’re predictably a lot cheaper while still coming packed with features. The CMF Headphone Pro , initially teased earlier this month , is now listed on Nothing’s web store. We haven’t gone ears-on with the new cans yet, but their spec sheet looks pretty stacked. The headphones are packing 40mm drivers, ANC, battery life that’ll apparently last for up to 100 hours of playback, and tactile physical controls, all wrapped up in CMF’s signature hip and colorful look.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google documents have indicated that Pixel phones were expanding support for call recording, and today we get an official announcement. Pixel 6 and newer hardware that doesn’t support Call Notes will be getting call recording. Google also shares that Call Notes is coming to Android Auto before the end of the year. Considering how easily your smartphone snaps a picture, shoots a video, or records a voice memo, it should be a lot more shocking than it is that so many Android users still struggle to access basic voice call recording. A complicated legal framework certainly doesn’t help matters any, but a few weeks back we found ourselves newly hopeful that things were getting better, as Google updated its support documentation to indicate that call recording was coming to Pixel 6 and newer devices. Despite that change, reports of users actually getting access were hard to come by — was this happening or not? Today, we’re finally getting some insight into what Google’s up to. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Listeners will have the option for random playback, irrespective of what was played before. They’ll also be able to reduce repeats, by taking recently played tracks out of the running. People have a problem with randomness. We don’t understand it, we have trouble recognizing it, and we often don’t even use the right words to describe it (no, your roommate’s friend’s dog walker is not a “random” addition to your party — they are there expressly because of those existing relationships). This is as true as ever when we’re talking about shuffling a media playlist. While a capital-r random order could include every song alphabetically, the same song over and over again, or not even change the playback order at all, when we say “random” what we tend to actually mean is “different and new.” And now it looks like Spotify is working on some new tools intended to help give listeners just that.

With a mass equal to 10–20% of the mass of the Milky Way, the Large Magellanic Cloud is the largest of the dozens of small galaxies that orbit our galaxy. The Large Magellanic Cloud is home to several massive stellar nurseries where gas clouds, like those strewn across this image, coalesce into new stars. Today’s image depicts a portion of the galaxy’s second-largest star-forming region, which is called N11. (The most massive and prolific star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the&nbsp; Tarantula Nebula , is a frequent target for Hubble.) We see bright, young stars lighting up the gas clouds and sculpting clumps of dust with powerful ultraviolet radiation. This image marries observations made roughly 20 years apart, a testament to Hubble’s longevity. The first set of observations, which were carried out in 2002–2003, capitalized on the exq…",

This past summer was one just full of change, and that was especially true for Google’s Android apps. With the embrace of Material 3 Expressive, apps tried on a whole new look, introducing colorful, high-contrast interfaces. Back in May, we first spotted Google trying out another new look, as it updated its multi-color G logo with a fresh new rainbow gradient appearance. It didn’t take long before we started seeing the spread of this new icon, popping up attached to Gemini in early July.

There’s a permanent new “Ask Home” text box at the top to talk to your smart home via Gemini, ask about security camera activity and device statuses, execute actions, or even demand help when building automations. All of this sounds great, and I can’t wait to test it out, but I can’t help but feel like Google is still missing out on more important and overdue updates to the Home app. Talking to Gemini is cool , but it doesn’t check all the boxes of what I expect from my smart home app. Instead, I wish Google would work on these six features.",

As a purely scientific tool, it’s a great way to sweep through troves of documents, research reports, news, and distill trends. While that makes it particularly useful for research, there’s one more sector that makes heavy use of it. The finance sector, particularly high-frequency trading, has been using AI and machine learning for a while now. Custom AI solutions are also used for predictive analytics and portfolio automation. However, those tools depend on highly specialized in-house AI tools. What I’ve been wondering is — can a general-purpose AI like Google Gemini be optimised to perform similar functions? I was curious to know if an AI model could make sense of my investments, identify risks, and maybe even suggest strategies that were worth testing. A few months ago, I decided to run a small experiment. Instead of blindly following every piece of advice from my portfolio advisor, I wanted to see what would happen if I brought Google’s Gemini AI into the mix. My idea was pretty straightforward.

I’m not exactly young myself as a millennial, but I’ve grown up in the digital age, which means I’ve picked up new tricks as they’ve come on the scene. Writing about them for a living helps quite a lot, too. But for my parents, these little Android features look like magic at times, and some of them can actually be game-changers. I’ve had to guide them through a couple of the tips more than once, but they’ve adopted many of them since. They’ve even impressed their friends with their newfound modern wizardry on occasion.",

Messages may automatically suggest an @mention when you start typing someone’s name. Being able to get someone’s attention by sending them an @username just feels incredibly natural to so many of us after years and years of these kind of interactions across social media. At this point, we’re honestly just surprised to find cases where it doesn’t work, and while the list of supported platforms includes Google stuff like Chats, so far that hasn’t extended to Messages. Earlier this year, we brought you an early preview of how @mentions in Messages were coming together, and now we’ve got some progress to share.

For example, Apple’s Handoff feature lets you seamlessly start a task on one device and pick it up on another. Google doesn’t currently offer a direct equivalent for Android, but mounting evidence suggests one is in the works. This new feature appears to be part of Google’s efforts to bring Android to PCs , which would enable the company to build more powerful cross-device experiences.",

I was happy to see a few interesting additions, like adding time delays, but Google is still shooting itself in the foot by artificially restricting so many possible automations and actions. As a Home Assistant and Google Home dual-platform user, I find the difference between what I can do on both laughable. Of course, I expect to do more in Home Assistant — that’s the whole point of a powerful and open platform like that — but so much of Google’s Home power is tied and limited, for no reason whatsoever.",

Messages may start coloring its previews to match page graphics. What do you think about before clicking on a link? Are you the sort of user who scrutinizes the URL, looking for any info that may help clarify what sort of content awaits on the other end? Do you just blindly click through without thinking twice? Or have you gotten used to apps that offer a bit of a preview, summarizing where the link goes with a headline and maybe even image teaser? Today we’re looking at that kind of preview action in one particular app, as we spot some in-development changes to how Google Messages handles link sharing.

It felt like before long, the iPhone would be the only actual small phone left — not a great sign for us Android fans. Then, things flipped. Small phones became cool again, bringing back the idea that less can be more, much to the delight of bona fide small phone fans and portable design champions like me. I’d go so far as to say that we’re in a golden age of small Android phones — or small phones in general. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 has settled at 6.2 inches, the iPhone 17 is a slightly larger 6.3, and even Google has a Pro-level Pixel with just a 6.3-inch display. And you know what? They’re all really good. I’ve spent time with every last small Android phone available in the US, and here are the ones I think are worth buying in 2025.",

For context, in the second quarter of 2025, Samsung shipped 58 million phones globally, 13.3 million of which were sold in the US . During that same period, Google shipped around 800,000 units in the US, while its global sales are not completely known.

These options now range from bare-bones budget plans to services nearly identical to postpaid, yet the sheer number of prepaid brands can be overwhelming. Some advertise heavily, but many remain obscure. Are these lesser-known carriers worth your attention, or is the risk too high? It really depends on what you want and how much risk you’re willing to take. First, it’s important to understand that there’s no clear line on what qualifies as a lesser-known carrier, as it comes down more to your individual knowledge about the industry. Thanks to increased advertising, you’ve likely at least heard of Boost Mobile, Mint Mobile, Cricket Wireless, Metro by T-Mobile, and maybe even a few other options like Tello or Total. Still, if a carrier is an absolute unknown to you, it pays to do your homework.",

    "body": "TL;DR YouTube has introduced a new Labs initiative that grants early access to experimental features. The first YouTube Labs experiment is a set of “AI music hosts” for YouTube Music. YouTube says Labs is open to a “limited number of US-based participants.” YouTube’s got a new way for you to try experimental functionality early. In keeping with Google’s programs like Search Labs, the streaming platform has announced an initiative it’s calling YouTube Labs, an opt-in program that’ll let you play around with new functionality before it’s generally available. You can sign up for Labs now — and its first experiment is already underway. In a short blog post, YouTube laid out the new program. YouTube Labs is “dedicated to exploring the potential of AI on YouTube,” and is accepting a “limited number” of US users to get the ball rolling. These new Labs experiments aren’t only about video: the first one is actually for YouTube Music.",

In 2024, AAS partnered with NCCN to broaden the impact of the Shapley lectureship program to community colleges, making use of NCCN’s existing network of 260 college instructors across 44 states and 120 participating Subject Matter Experts (SME) to “matchmake” community colleges with astronomers.

This will be achieved by implementing gfxstream, a technology that forwards graphics API calls to the host’s GPU for near-native performance. Evidence for this was found in a hidden “Graphics Acceleration” setting in the Terminal app that enables a new “GPU-accelerated renderer.” Earlier this year, Google introduced the Linux Terminal app , giving developers and power users the ability to run full-fledged Linux applications on their Android devices. While it was initially limited to command-line apps, Google recently added support for running Linux apps with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), a significant step forward for the feature. However, there’s a major catch with the current implementation. All graphics rendering is handled by the CPU instead of the GPU, which is not only incredibly slow but also very taxing on a device’s battery and thermals. This is only a temporary problem, though, as Google is already working on a new feature that will make these apps run significantly better.",

Numerous reports indicate that watching a single channel appears fine, but the quality severely degrades when watching two, three, or four channels at once. This is reportedly happening even with fast, wired internet connections and with other streaming apps running fine, suggesting it may be an issue with YouTube TV itself. YouTube TV’s multiview feature is one of my favorite things about the streaming service, especially right now during football season when I can have four games playing simultaneously on any given Sunday. Unfortunately, multiview hasn’t been working very well for a lot of YouTube TV subscribers. For the last couple of weeks, the r/YouTubeTV subreddit has been flooded with user complaints about multiview being hampered by extremely low picture quality, including comments about multiview streams appearing blocky and “sometimes unviewable.”",

The PS2 emulator NetherSX2 got a big update just a few months ago, but it didn’t take long for some users to notice that it had a few issues. Rather than improving the overall performance of the closed-source AetherSX2 emulator, it had a few regressions that caused visual bugs in games that previously didn’t have them. Now, developer Trixarian has released another update, version 2.1, to fix these regressions and improve overall performance. There are specific fixes for the Jak games, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, Timesplitters, and more.",

People like me, who don’t own a car and rely on their feet and public transport, have had to accept a subpar experience that doesn’t come anywhere near driving directions, with no easy way to check out Maps without leaving the ongoing trip. Now, Maps is rolling out an update that brings a big change to public transit navigation, and I noticed it yesterday on my phone as I was zooming through Paris to get to a theatre. Let me walk you through the changes. Transit navigation no longer locks out the rest of Maps My biggest pet peeve when using public transit directions on Google Maps is how inflexible this used to be.

This new accessibility setting, available in the 2509 Android Canary build, disables background blur system-wide to improve text visibility. It replaces a developer option, making it much easier for regular users to find and enable the feature once it rolls out. The team at Android Authority is a big fan of Android’s new Material 3 Expressive redesign, and it seems we’re not alone. According to our recent poll, nearly 63% of you love it too , while most of the remaining 37% find it acceptable. For the small fraction of our readers who dislike the new design, the primary complaint is readability. Material 3 Expressive makes copious use of background blur effects, which, while visually appealing, comes at the cost of text visibility. Although this may not affect most people, the reduced contrast poses an accessibility challenge for some users. To address this, Google plans to roll out a new Android setting that reduces these background blur effects.

Both of these toggles would automatically decide when your phone switches from mobile data to Wi-Fi. It seems like one toggle could let your phone automatically switch to mobile data based on places where you’ve manually made the switch. Many Android phones today offer an option to seamlessly switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi as needed. This is particularly useful if you’ve got a poor Wi-Fi connection, allowing you to automatically switch to mobile data for a better experience. However, it looks like Samsung could offer two ways to customize this switch-over experience. SammyGuru reports that One UI 8.5 has two AI-related toggles that govern when you switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data. The first toggle is called Intelligent Link Assessment , and switches your phone from Wi-Fi to mobile data based on “Wi-Fi link data.” I’m guessing this means the phone will look at your Wi-Fi connection’s speed, latency, and other factors before deciding to switch. That’s pretty similar to the option seen on phones from other companies.",

The new iPhone 17 series is picking up scratches like no other, forcing me to consider a break from my no-case lifestyle to keep my phone presentable.",
