It looked like curtains when Riot canceled the game after seven turbulent years in development, but earlier this month the original owner bought the game back in hopes of realizing the \"original vision\" that predates Riot's involvement. Developer Hypixel has been moving quickly, showing off new gameplay a single day after the buyback, and now, announcing its early access release date: January 13, 2026. The announcement, like the last few bits of news from the developer, comes with a warning to manage your expectations. Before releasing that gameplay footage it showed off, the studio clarified it was \"raw and broken,\" and when a $20 price tag was announced , CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme said he was pricing it as low as was feasible because he didn't \"think the game is good yet.\" With the release date announcement, Laflamme has reiterated in a post on X that \"the game isn't good yet\" though \"eventually, it will be,\" adding \"if you don’t feel comfortable pre-ordering or participating in early access, please don’t … The first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more.\" The game's content lead, Polina Log…",

This would mark a huge comeback of the partnership between the two companies, which Apple started to move away from in 2020. Intel used to make chips for Apple, well, Apple used to use Intel CPUs, but those processors were based on x86 architecture—and, I'm sorry to say, were nowhere near as impressive as Apple's own M-series chips. Apple's move to making its own chips signified an end to its partnership with Intel, but also the beginning of a new era, one where the M-series consistently obliterates its competitors in performance-per-watt. Apple doesn't seem to be changing its mind where the M-series is concerned, though. This new partnership wouldn't involve switching back to an Intel processor, but rather it'd involve Intel manufacturing Apple M-series chips in its own foundries. Kuo revealed that Apple plans to use Intel's 18AP process node for this. (Image credit: Future) Ming-Chi Kuo teased that Apple's plan is for Intel to make its lowest-end M-series processor.

To that end, Noctua has just quietly shared some good news for those who are already on an Intel platform: its coolers will still work with Intel's upcoming LGA1954 socket. The company wrote on its FAQ page that the same coolers that have worked with the LGA1700 (Intel Alder Lake and Raptor Lake), as well as LGA1851 (Intel Arrow Lake), will remain compatible once the next gen rolls around. Noctua products aren't exactly cheap, but they're powerful, which is why we deem the Noctua NH-D15 to be the best CPU air cooler . But it's one pricey beast. It costs $180 on Amazon right now, and Black Friday PC gaming deals seem to have had no impact on its price tag.

Yakuza Kiwami 3 (and its bonus add-in game, Dark Ties ) is prepping for its February release by doling out info about some of the new features RGG Studio is baking into the game. There are new minigames, a new market, something called \"Drink Links,\" and various good deeds for Kazuma Kiryu and Yoshitaka Mine to get involved in. Absolutely none of which is the great news I mentioned. The great news is that one of the new features is called \"Daddy Rank,\" which means I get to write the words Daddy Rank like a hundred times in this article and no one can reasonably stop me [ it's true, we can't - Ed. ]. Daddy Rank. What's Daddy Rank? You might think it's something that Kiryu has maxed out just, like, intrinsically, but it is in fact \"a rank that represents Kiryu's growth as a caretaker\" at the orphanage he runs in Kiwami 3, like the real bastard organised criminal he is. \"Lacking experience in housekeeping, Kiryu will improve his skills and learn a wider range of recipes, cooking dishes that kids request to unlock heartwarming new stories.\" You won't get this kind of action in GTA 6. As much as I enjoy saying Daddy Rank, …",

Valve has since confirmed that it does not plan to sell the Steam Machine at a loss , which is a reasonably common console play, the idea being to get people using a given platform and then make money on game sales. Could that—even, should that—model apply to the Steam Machine? The publishing director of Larian Studios, the outfit behind Baldur's Gate 3 among other high-profile games, clearly thinks so. I know subsidising hardware is unfashionable now but surely they're losing far more than a ~200$ difference by not having people on the storefront, which is essentially a money printing machine. That said it isn't stupid to not sell things at a loss, just peculiar in this case. https://t.co/9J3Y4EXoq9 November 23, 2025 News that the Steam Machine won't be subsidised was enough to have Michael Douse commenting on X. \"I know subsidising hardware is unfashionable now but surely they're losing far more than a ~200$ difference by not having people on the storefront, which is essentially a money printing machine.

So, I was very pleased to discover the community-made ' Arc Forge ', which is basically an item database that now lives on my second monitor while I'm playing, just like Meta Forge's interactive maps (which you should also use). Arc Forge's most impressive feature, and why I've come to use it, is how it displays the crafting, recycling, salvaging, and repair values for all the items in a neat 'crafting glyph' chart.

Spotted by MP1st , the European trademark filing wasn't made by Remedy but by a company called Nordia Law, a law firm with offices in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, where Remedy is based. But Nordia does have a history with Remedy: It provided legal advice to the studio in its Control 2 contract negotiations with 505 Games, for instance, (a deal that has since been undone ) and also assisted in negotiating financing deals with Tencent and Annapurna . So there's some real history there. It's no secret that a Control sequel is in development: Remedy said so back in 2022. Whether Control Resonant is that sequel is an open question, however. The trademark filing covers a lot of ground, from \"computer gaming software\" to \"printed matter\" like books and magazines, television shows, movies, music, clothing, and even, for some reason, \"lanyards for holding keys.\" It's pretty broad, in other words, and the title could be a reference to something other than a new …",

Given how expensive RAM is right now, many gamers are holding off on their upgrades in the hopes that the market will improve in the next few months. It makes sense—when you're seeing RAM kits sold for twice the price that they used to be sold for, it's hard not to want to wait it out. The Black Friday sales have only highlighted this, when we look back at the offers around Prime Day in July—just over four months ago, remember—we've seen prices rising from $170 for a 64 GB DDR5 kit to at least $600. However, Santos says that if you want to get your upgrades, it's better to act fast. When faced with a question regarding memory shortages that could potentially extend into 2027 (oh, joy) and how to navigate rising prices, Santos said: \"For consumers that are interested in getting a new PC or upgrading their current system’s GPU, SSD or R…",

But aside from that, it's not the content you would've expected to see ten years ago. There's a good reason for this though, which PewDiePie explains in the November Kjellberg Mail newsletter. He shared, \"Since becoming a dad, everything does get evaluated differently. Every hour has weight now in a way it didn't before. One of the biggest things I decided to drop was videogames. But here's the thing: if I really wanted to, there'd be plenty of time for me to play videogames. I've just decided that, if time is limited, I'd rather be doing some…",

The disclosure indicates that AI has seeped into a fair chunk of the game, touching \"Background signboard textures, records illustrations, InfoCast videos,\" as well as \"Voices and music.\" Which is a real bummer, if you ask me. The original Let It Die isn't exactly a beloved classic, but it's a strange and unique thing, like so much that comes out of Goichi Suda's Grasshopper Manufacture studio. A very human game, then—a testament to the powers of what voice actor Jennifer English so recently called our \"beautiful, creative, human brains.\" Let It Die: Inferno isn't a Grasshopper Manufacture product, mind you. Its sole development studio is Supertrick Games, which (stay with me) is a kind of rump state of the original Grasshopper Manufacture.

Although the company's actual keebs don't rank on our list of the best gaming keyboards , the switches are in a league of their own—or they used to be, at least. However, Cherry seems to have fallen on hard times, with a net loss of $23 million (20.4 million euros) between January and the end of September 2025. This was with a turnover of nearly $82 million (70.7 million euros), leaving the company with more debt than equity. The future of its Peripherals division is also uncertain, and that's why it's hard to predict what will even happen to these keyboards in the future. According to Heise , Cherry is considering selling either its Peripherals division, which includes all its keyboards and mice, or the Digital Health & Solutions division. Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general \"peripherals\" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.

Together, these chips could represent the start of a new processing paradigm which could do for the AI industry what ASICs did for bitcoin mining. In both cases, we're talking about chips broadly known as TPUs or tensor processing units. They're a kind of ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit, that's designed at hardware level to do a very narrow set of AI-related tasks very well. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs, even its AI-specific GPUs as opposed to its gaming GPUs, are more general purpose in nature. The parallel here is bitcoin mining, which used to be done on graphics cards before a new generation of dedicated mining chips, also ASICs, came along and did the same job much more efficiently. Could the same transition from more general purpose GPUs to ASICs hit the AI industry? The Chinese startup is Zhonghao Xinying.

Speaking to GamesRadar via interpreter, director Choi Ji-won is honoured to receive the accolade: \"I'm so happy that I'm lost for words right now … we didn't just view it as just pure expansion, but almost as a sequel and a brand new project.\" As for the actual Lies of P sequel that's in the works, Choi Ji-Won asks fans to \"please stay tuned for it; we are working really hard, and I will not disappoint you at all.\" And you know what, I fully believe him. Overture is, in my humble opinion, one of the best DLCs released for a soulslike game period—it's imaginative and well-designed, sure, but it also marks Neowiz finally finding its legs after a game that initially struck critics ( including us, I'm sorry to say ) as a Bloodborne carbon copy.

Some of the stuff that's been unearthed was already discovered in the PC version, but is present here in expanded form. For instance, it's long been known that Mr. House originally had a second securitron girlfriend named Marilyn—she's on one of the playing cards that came with the collector's edition, and there's a mod to restore her along with the single voice line left in the release version.

A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct. For those who haven't seen Kill Bill, or maybe just forgot, one of the film's secondary fights is a showdown between The Bride and Gogo Yubari , a teenage psycho killer in the employ of O-Ren Ishii, head of the yakuza in Tokyo. Gogo dies, rather badly (spoiler, sorry), and then, well, so does everyone else. The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film. Based on the teaser, Yuki is basically Gogo, except maybe a little psychotically peppier and with a fondness for guns rather than a meteor hammer.

Those of you hip to pattern recognition might note that those predecessor games seemed to get multiple expansions (Origins, likewise, got multiple), but it seems that won't be the case for Shadows. In a chat with JorRaptor (via IGN ), the game's associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois said that, \"at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned, currently.\" Which is a tad surprising, given Ubisoft's recent statement that the game is \" Overperforming \" against its expectations. I think the wording here is worth bearing in mind. Ubi's got no mondo-size expansions in the pipe, but Lemay-Comtois notes that \"We're still working on content for post-launch, and supporting it,\" so it's not quite as though the game is just being dropped.

Sega's announced that, when Yakuza 0's spruced-up Director's Cut releases on December 8, the original version's getting delisted. So far, Sega's only said it's getting delisted on Steam, and I'm not sure if that will also apply to other storefronts. I've reached out to Sega to ask about this, and will update if I hear back. You might think that's not such a big deal. After all, the Director's Cut will contain all the parts of the original game inside it like a beautiful criminal pupa, but the shift also entails a big change in the game's price.

    "body": "We all saw it coming, but it still doesn't feel great. It seems that the RAM shortage that has us all mourning the not-so-terrible prices of a few months ago might now also open the door to a GPU shortage, and small GPU vendors will be hit the hardest. Reputable leaker Golden Pig Upgrade Pack on Weibo (via VideoCardz ) claims Nvidia is planning to stop bundling VRAM with its GPU dies. Nvidia always supplied both the GPU and the VRAM to its add-in card (AIC) partners... well, potentially up until now. This made it easier for GPU manufacturers to stay on spec, but also removed the need for them to source DRAM directly from memory giants like Micron or Samsung. So, Nvidia took care of the VRAM and the GPU die, and the AIC did whatever they wanted with the rest of it, customizing the graphics card before selling it. If Nvidia has indeed decided to only ship the GPU going forward, its board partners will now need to secure VRAM all on their own. Given how volatile normal memory pricing is right now , that could be a challenge for some brands. The short supply of memory doesn't just affect the RAM kits we stick in our PCs. It will extends to VRAM, too, with production being pointed towa…",

So says TOW2 director Brandon Adler in a chat with the My Perfect Console podcast (via GamesRadar ). \"We're not going out of our way and saying 'Let's do a critique of capitalism as we currently see it,'\" said Adler. \"In general, what we like to do is—especially in The Outer Worlds—is a critique on the power structures… more of the people in power and how they abuse the people that don't have that power.\" Adler points at TOW2's Order of the Ascendant—which seeks to \"perfect humanity\"—to illustrate his point. \"They will even poison their own people to some extent if it tries to prove the point that they're trying to prove.
