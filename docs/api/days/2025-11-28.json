There's been no better time to try it than its 15th anniversary, as the original game is going for just $1.19 on Steam . That's the lowest it's ever been, with a price of $5.99 standing as the steepest discount recorded by SteamDB in the last two years: that's a jump from 70% to 94% off. You can also get the bundle with all the games in the series that made it to Steam for a little over $13. Thematically it's somewhere between a high school drama, Saw, and an Agatha Christie novel, with a psychotic teddy bear turning an academy into a prison of murder and mischief. While it is a visual novel, it's more gamey than the genre name perhaps implies: you investigate murders as they happen and try to pin the deed on the right culprit in a stylish minigame, literally \"firing their words back at them\" with metaphorical truth bullets.

As Team Cherry developer Ari Gibson told Jason Schreier in a recent Bloomberg interview , Silksong is \"on that knife's edge, where it appeals to some and infuriates others.\" Gibson said so after the two were asked if they'd be attending The Game Awards, where Silksong is nominated alongside the likes of Death Stranding 2 and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for Game of the Year. All big hits, but Team Cherry isn't holding out for the big prize. Pellen said they may not attend the show as they're \"pretty busy,\" and said he was confident they wouldn't have to record an acceptance speech either. Gibson chimed in: \"This year I think we're safe. I think Expedition 33—it's exceptional and broadly palatable.\" Silksong, on the other hand, left some players polarized by its intense difficulty . Even in his PC Gamer review that scored the game a 90, Tyler Colp called playing the game a \"Sisyphean exercise.\" Expedition 33 has a breezy story mode di…",

The list of games that scrambled when Team Cherry surprise-dropped a date was impressively long. A total of eight games, including Demonschool and Baby Steps , had their schedules pushed forward in response. \"To some extent that probably is unfortunate,\" Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told Bloomberg when asked about the flurry of Silksong-induced delays earlier this year. He says it all happened so fast that the date was a surprise to the team working on it, too. \"Even we felt like we didn't have a lot of control over our own date because we basically were rushing, rushing, rushing toward the end, working right up until the last point,\" he says. \"And then the minute we thought this was ready to release, suddenly we're releasing it.\" Gibson says the release date wasn't finalized until \"basically a…",

This would mark a huge comeback of the partnership between the two companies, which Apple started to move away from in 2020. Intel used to make chips for Apple, well, Apple used to use Intel CPUs, but those processors were based on x86 architecture—and, I'm sorry to say, were nowhere near as impressive as Apple's own M-series chips. Apple's move to making its own chips signified an end to its partnership with Intel, but also the beginning of a new era, one where the M-series consistently obliterates its competitors in performance-per-watt. Apple doesn't seem to be changing its mind where the M-series is concerned, though. This new partnership wouldn't involve switching back to an Intel processor, but rather it'd involve Intel manufacturing Apple M-series chips in its own foundries. Kuo revealed that Apple plans to use Intel's 18AP process node for this. (Image credit: Future) Ming-Chi Kuo teased that Apple's plan is for Intel to make its lowest-end M-series processor.

And if that happens, they'll need a cooler, because if there's one thing a good CPU can do, it's run hot. To that end, Noctua has just quietly shared some good news for those who are already on an Intel platform: its coolers will still work with Intel's upcoming LGA1954 socket. The company wrote on its FAQ page that the same coolers that have worked with the LGA1700 (Intel Alder Lake and Raptor Lake), as well as LGA1851 (Intel Arrow Lake), will remain compatible once the next gen rolls around. Noctua products aren't exactly cheap, but they're powerful, which is why we deem the Noctua NH-D15 to be the best CPU air cooler . But it's one pricey beast. It costs $180 on Amazon right now, and Black Friday PC gaming deals seem to have had no impact on its price tag. (Image credit: Future) Intel Nova Lake really does sound exciting, so this is good news for gamers who are willing to give Intel another go. Arrow Lake's gaming performance was disappointing, but Intel seems to be making big strides toward ensuring that Nova Lake —aka Core Ultra 400 ser…",

Arc Forge's most impressive feature, and why I've come to use it, is how it displays the crafting, recycling, salvaging, and repair values for all the items in a neat 'crafting glyph' chart. And you can keep going down this rabbit hole by clicking on each item until you reach a dead end. (Image credit: ARC Forge) Say you need Speaker Components, but you're having no luck finding them. Well, look up that item, and you'll find out that Headphones, Frequency Modulation Boxes, Radios, Radio Relays, Noisemakers, Photelectric Cloaks, and Lure Grenades all recycle into various amounts of Sp…",

    "body": "CD Projekt won't be bringing The Witcher 4 to The Game Awards this year, but a new trademark filing for something called Control Resonant has some gamers hoping that Remedy will fill the void with something cool of its own. Spotted by MP1st , the European trademark filing wasn't made by Remedy but by a company called Nordia Law, a law firm with offices in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, where Remedy is based. But Nordia does have a history with Remedy: It provided legal advice to the studio in its Control 2 contract negotiations with 505 Games, for instance, (a deal that has since been undone ) and also assisted in negotiating financing deals with Tencent and Annapurna . So there's some real history there. It's no secret that a Control sequel is in development: Remedy said so back in 2022. Whether Control Resonant is that sequel is an open question, however. The trademark filing covers a lot of ground, from \"computer gaming software\" to \"printed matter\" like books and magazines, television shows, movies, music, clothing, and even, for some reason, \"lanyards for holding keys.\" It's pretty broad, in other words, and the title could be a reference to something other than a new …",

Well, here's an early heads up: The RAM apocalypse/hellscape/nightmare we're living in right now isn't about to get any better, says Maingear CEO Wallace Santos (via Wccftech ). Given how expensive RAM is right now, many gamers are holding off on their upgrades in the hopes that the market will improve in the next few months. It makes sense—when you're seeing RAM kits sold for twice the price that they used to be sold for, it's hard not to want to wait it out. The Black Friday sales have only highlighted this, when we look back at the offers around Prime Day in July—just over four months ago, remember—we've seen prices rising from $170 for a 64 GB DDR5 kit to at least $600. However, Santos says that if you want to get your upgrades, it's better to act fast. When faced with a question regarding memory shortages that could potentially extend into 2027 (oh, joy) and how to navigate rising prices, Santos said: \"For consumers that are interested in getting a new PC or upgrading their current system’s GPU, SSD or R…",

Eight years ago, a video titled \"Why I don't play video games anymore\" was uploaded to the PewDiePie channel, explaining the reasons behind the lack of Let's Play videos. Since then, his channel has adapted into more lifestyle blogging and the occasional hobby vlog. Of course, there are a few games sprinkled in, with the most recent video featuring Geoguessr. But aside from that, it's not the content you would've expected to see ten years ago. There's a good reason for this though, which PewDiePie explains in the November Kjellberg Mail newsletter.

Although the company's actual keebs don't rank on our list of the best gaming keyboards , the switches are in a league of their own—or they used to be, at least. However, Cherry seems to have fallen on hard times, with a net loss of $23 million (20.4 million euros) between January and the end of September 2025. This was with a turnover of nearly $82 million (70.7 million euros), leaving the company with more debt than equity. The future of its Peripherals division is also uncertain, and that's why it's hard to predict what will even happen to these keyboards in the future. According to Heise , Cherry is considering selling either its Peripherals division, which includes all its keyboards and mice, or the Digital Health & Solutions division. Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general \"peripherals\" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.

Together, these chips could represent the start of a new processing paradigm which could do for the AI industry what ASICs did for bitcoin mining. In both cases, we're talking about chips broadly known as TPUs or tensor processing units. They're a kind of ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit, that's designed at hardware level to do a very narrow set of AI-related tasks very well. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs, even its AI-specific GPUs as opposed to its gaming GPUs, are more general purpose in nature. The parallel here is bitcoin mining, which used to be done on graphics cards before a new generation of dedicated mining chips, also ASICs, came along and did the same job much more efficiently. Could the same transition from more general purpose GPUs to ASICs hit the AI industry? The Chinese startup is Zhonghao Xinying.

Speaking to GamesRadar via interpreter, director Choi Ji-won is honoured to receive the accolade: \"I'm so happy that I'm lost for words right now … we didn't just view it as just pure expansion, but almost as a sequel and a brand new project.\" As for the actual Lies of P sequel that's in the works, Choi Ji-Won asks fans to \"please stay tuned for it; we are working really hard, and I will not disappoint you at all.\" And you know what, I fully believe him. Overture is, in my humble opinion, one of the best DLCs released for a soulslike game period—it's imaginative and well-designed, sure, but it also marks Neowiz finally finding its legs after a game that initially struck critics ( including us, I'm sorry to say ) as a Bloodborne carbon copy.

This build, and a release build with debug features enabled as well as another drive with the DLC, were found on a pair of Xbox 360 dev kits in a second-hand store where they'd been sitting for a year. Some of the stuff that's been unearthed was already discovered in the PC version, but is present here in expanded form. For instance, it's long been known that Mr. House originally had a second securitron girlfriend named Marilyn—she's on one of the playing cards that came with the collector's edition, and there's a mod to restore her along with the single voice line left in the release version.

    "body": "We learned last week that the realm of Fortnite, the real 'everything app,' will be expanding its borders even further through the adoption of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill—specifically an \"unfilmed scene\" entitled The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge . A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct. For those who haven't seen Kill Bill, or maybe just forgot, one of the film's secondary fights is a showdown between The Bride and Gogo Yubari , a teenage psycho killer in the employ of O-Ren Ishii, head of the yakuza in Tokyo. Gogo dies, rather badly (spoiler, sorry), and then, well, so does everyone else. The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film. Based on the teaser, Yuki is basically Gogo, except maybe a little psychotically peppier and with a fondness for guns rather than a meteor hammer.

Although long gone, it's far from forgotten, as can be gathered from this Lego Ideas project . Made by lem.designs, the project is a faithful replica of the ZX Sinclair, all made out of Lego bricks. It won't play any of the classics, but it'll definitely fill you with nostalgia. The project comes with a total of 2,130 Lego pieces, and a big part of that will go towards the computer itself. The sleek PC looks almost just like the real thing, including a realistic keyboard with keys you can actually press. The keyboard alone accounts for 100 printed tiles, with stuff you're unlikely to find on keyboards of today, including \"GOTO,\" \"GOSUB,\" \"LOAD,\" and \"RUN.\" In the very corner of the ZX Spectrum, you'll find rainbow stripes, just like on the real thing.

The way Captain Wayne perfectly nails a '90s cartoon look in active gameplay also reminds me a lot of Pizza Tower. The whole arsenal has a great feel to it: One real winner is Captain Wayne's machine gun, which has to spin up like a mini gun and shakes the entire screen as it empties your entire ammo reserve in a matter of seconds. It's hard to stand out as a videogame shotgun these days, but the one in Captain Wayne has a great sound and feedback, this excellent two-shot pow pow chk chk rhythm that really clicked with me.

Dell's COO Jeffrey Clarke says during the earnings call : \"We have not completed the Windows 11 transition.\" I wish I could call that shocking, but it's really not. It took until July 2025 for Windows 11 to overtake Windows 10 as the most popular Microsoft operating system. That was nearly four years since its initial release, and was likely spurred by the fact that Windows 10 was reaching the end of support. We saw an uptick of Windows 11 users in a recent Steam Hardware Survey , showing just how many users were holding off until the last minute.

I know they say don't judge a book by its cover, but if I've got loot and there's another raider nearby, I've not got long to make a move to decide our fates.

I think the wording here is worth bearing in mind. Ubi's got no mondo-size expansions in the pipe, but Lemay-Comtois notes that \"We're still working on content for post-launch, and supporting it,\" so it's not quite as though the game is just being dropped.

    "body": "Asus has just released two new security updates : one for the MyAsus app, and one for its routers. Asus itself has said that you should download these patches \"immediately\", and with good reason. The MyAsus app update fixes a flaw, rated as high severity, that could give unauthorized attackers higher system privileges. On the router side, researchers found a few different flaws, and some of them seem dangerous—two are rated \"high\" and one is rated \"critical\". The worst bit is how widespread these vulnerabilities could potentially be. The MyAsus app is pre-installed on Asus PCs, and it's used for things like system maintenance and updates. As a result, any flaws in that app could put a lot of users at risk. And seeing as Asus ranks high on the list of the best gaming routers , any vulnerabilities within their firmware are a big deal, too. (Image credit: Future) Asus notes that the security updates for the MyAsus software apply to \"all personal computer, including desktop, laptop, NUC, and All-in-One PC.\" If you own any of those products made by Asus, you'd best get your updates in order ASAP.

Thunderobot claims it is China's \"first domestically produced gaming PC.\" For now, the rest of the specifications aren't clear, but the system has been pictured configured with a large, unidentified Nvidia RTX GPU fitted. So, what exactly is going on here? This is all a bit complicated. But it turns out that AMD entered into a hugely complex licensing arrangement with Chinese chip producer Hygon way back in 2016. Reports from years ago imply the move was made somewhat out of desperation, what with AMD being so strapped for cash at the time. Immediately, the question of how any of this is possible leaps to mind, what with hugely complex cross-licensing arrangements between Intel and AMD that effectively prevent any other company from getting in on the x86 CPU game.

I feel like I've already spent 100+ hours with the best one. If you're one of the unlucky few who's yet to pick the game up, you may want to get on that. Sega's announced that, when Yakuza 0's spruced-up Director's Cut releases on December 8, the original version's getting delisted. So far, Sega's only said it's getting delisted on Steam, and I'm not sure if that will also apply to other storefronts. I've reached out to Sega to ask about this, and will update if I hear back. You might think that's not such a big deal. After all, the Director's Cut will contain all the parts of the original game inside it like a beautiful criminal pupa, but the shift also entails a big change in the game's price. Right now, you can pick up original Yakuza 0 for a paltry $20. When it launches, the Director's Cut will set you back $50. Sega even—a little cheekily, I think—notes that if you were to pick up …",

Which, one might worry, could eventually include drugs. As a matter of fact, its creator Tyler tells our friends over at GamesRadar that this was enough of a concern to develop a backup plan in case Steam didn't accept the game to its platform: \"Early during development, I had a plan where, if Steam wouldn't take it for whatever reason, I could just pivot it to be a farming game. Just strip all the drug stuff out, make it a farming game—but thankfully, it was all right.\" That's not to say Tyler's had it easy when it comes to international censorship or ratings issues. Easy enough to be a bestseller, sure, but not entirely immune to oversight: \"A couple of countries don't love it; that's fine. Australia was one of them for a little while.

Issues with free loadout players have been exacerbated by Stella Montis, the smallest and most aggressive map in Arc Raiders, as players are seeing more killer free loadouters than usual. People who use free loadouts get given a low-level gun, ammo, shield, and health, not a lot, but enough to do well, but with none of their stuff on the line, so they can be more aggressive than usual.

You'll drain stamina, so it's not quite infinite as the YouTuber above, Jiibii, says. But it's not all that intensive. It's a neat trick and something I had no clue you could do, and most importantly, something I'd never have figured out myself because, well, I'm not quite sure where it's actually practical.
