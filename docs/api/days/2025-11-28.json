Meanwhile, Google itself is now reportedly considering whether to make its own specialised AI chips available to buy. Together, these chips could represent the start of a new processing paradigm which could do for the AI industry what ASICs did for bitcoin mining. In both cases, we're talking about chips broadly known as TPUs or tensor processing units. They're a kind of ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit, that's designed at hardware level to do a very narrow set of AI-related tasks very well. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs, even its AI-specific GPUs as opposed to its gaming GPUs, are more general purpose in nature. The parallel here is bitcoin mining, which used to be done on graphics cards before a new generation of dedicated mining chips, also ASICs, came along and did the same job much more efficiently. Could the same transition from more general purpose GPUs to ASICs hit the AI industry? The Chinese startup is Zhonghao Xinying. Its Ghana chip is claimed to offer 1.5 times the performance of Nvidia's…",

It's done good by developer Neowiz, too—not only selling well , but also pulling in an award for Best Game Expansion during the Golden Joystick Awards. Speaking to GamesRadar via interpreter, director Choi Ji-won is honoured to receive the accolade: \"I'm so happy that I'm lost for words right now … we didn't just view it as just pure expansion, but almost as a sequel and a brand new project.\" As for the actual Lies of P sequel that's in the works, Choi Ji-Won asks fans to \"please stay tuned for it; we are working really hard, and I will not disappoint you at all.\" And you know what, I fully believe him. Overture is, in my humble opinion, one of the best DLCs released for a soulslike game period—it's imaginative and well-designed, sure, but it also marks Neowiz finally finding its legs after a game that initially struck critics ( including us, I'm sorry to say ) as a Bloodborne carbon copy.

    "body": "نصح نجم مانشستر يونايتد السابق لويس ساها ناديه بالتعاقد مع مهاجم \"شديد الخبرة\" في يناير/كانون الثاني المقبل، لتوفير منافسة لبنجامين سيسكو في خط الهجوم. &nbsp; وكان يونايتد قد ضم سيسكو، البالغ 22 عامًا، الصيف الماضي قادما من لايبزج في صفقة بلغت 74 مليون جنيه إسترليني، لكنه سجل هدفين فقط وصنع آخر في 12 مباراة قبل تعرضه لإصابة في الركبة. ويعاني يونايتد من قلة الخيارات في مركز المهاجم الصريح، إذ يفضّل ماتيوس كونيا اللعب خلف المهاجم، بينما لم يُظهر جوشوا زيركزي مستواه المنتظر حتى الآن. &nbsp; ولهذا، أكد ساها (47 عامًا) ضرورة أن يتحرك النادي في سوق الانتقالات الشتوية لضم مهاجم جديد، مشيرًا إلى أن مانشستر يونايتد يجب أن يفكر بجدية في استعادة داني ويلبيك إلى تشكيلة روبن أموريم. &nbsp; ويقدم ويلبيك، البالغ 35 عاما، موسما مميزا مع برايتون، حيث سجل سبعة أهداف وصنع هدفًا في 14 مباراة بجميع البطولات، مما جعله—بحسب ساها—خيارًا مثاليًا لإضافة عمق أكبر لخط الهجوم في أولد ترافورد. &nbsp; وقال ساها في تصريحات نقلتها صحيفة \"ذا صن\": \"كنت أتمنى أن يوقع يونايتد مع داني في بداية الموسم. إنه ليس موهوبًا فقط، بل فعال للغاية ويمتلك خبرة كبيرة\". &nbsp; واستعاد ساها ذكرياته عند وصوله إلى مانشستر يونايتد في 2004 قادمًا من فولهام، موضحًا أهمية وجود عمق هجوم. &nbsp; وأضاف: \"عندما انضممت إلى النادي، كان هناك رود…",

It will, however, be charging money for the first of several new \"Paradox Classes\" coming out alongside it. This is despite the fact that, when it was Kickstarted , Last Epoch promised, \"The only form of real money microtransactions Last Epoch will ever have are cosmetic\" and a \"one-time payment will be all that a player will have to spend to have the complete Last Epoch experience and be on the same footing as other players.\" Last Epoch's overall Steam rating of Very Positive now stands in marked contrast to its Mixed rating based on recent reviews, only 42% of which have been positive. As well as the broken promise of the Kickstarter and concerns the new class will be overpowered to encourage people to buy it, players raise ongoing issues with Last Epoch that have yet to be addressed. \"Half bake…",

This build, and a release build with debug features enabled as well as another drive with the DLC, were found on a pair of Xbox 360 dev kits in a second-hand store where they'd been sitting for a year. Some of the stuff that's been unearthed was already discovered in the PC version, but is present here in expanded form. For instance, it's long been known that Mr. House originally had a second securitron girlfriend named Marilyn—she's on one of the playing cards that came with the collector's edition, and there's a mod to restore her along with the single voice line left in the release version. But load up this build and you can have a whole conversation with Marilyn . There's also an early version of Mr. House, with a face that looks a lot more Steve Buscemi than the suave charac…",

But here's something really different: as if to explore the frontier of unintended ways to play Minecraft, YouTuber smillgames has elected to play it on a printer . The sort used in restaurants. Eyup. Unlike the numerous attempts to play Doom on increasingly basic technology— a vape , or itself , for instance—this isn't about getting the game itself to run on the device. In smillgames' scenario, a different device is running Minecraft as normal. The receipt printer is merely used as a monitor of sorts, as he shared in a post on X . my next video might actually be the dumbest thing I've ever done pic.twitter.com/HFz6bAiCYH November 22, 2025 There is precedent for this; I think smill is getting the same sort of FPS I was getting on Oblivion back in the day.

A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct. For those who haven't seen Kill Bill, or maybe just forgot, one of the film's secondary fights is a showdown between The Bride and Gogo Yubari , a teenage psycho killer in the employ of O-Ren Ishii, head of the yakuza in Tokyo. Gogo dies, rather badly (spoiler, sorry), and then, well, so does everyone else. The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film. Based on the teaser, Yuki is basically Gogo, except maybe a little psychotically peppier and with a fondness for guns rather than a meteor hammer. The first thing I noticed in the teaser is a change to the Pussy Wa…",

It took until July 2025 for Windows 11 to overtake Windows 10 as the most popular Microsoft operating system. That was nearly four years since its initial release, and was likely spurred by the fact that Windows 10 was reaching the end of support. We saw an uptick of Windows 11 users in a recent Steam Hardware Survey , showing just how many users were holding off until the last minute.

Arc Raiders already has heaps of fantastic cosmetics for every type of player, whether you're a bloodthirsty PvP'er running around in a fear-inducing mask or a humble Minion-like fisher who wouldn't hurt a fly. After making friends with many a raider, being betrayed almost as often, and even taking a few names myself on occasion, I thought it wise for my own pre-match planning to mull over my approach. I know they say don't judge a book by its cover, but if I've got loot and there's another raider nearby, I've not got long to make a move to decide our fates. I'm usually one to say hi and reveal my location first, and shoot only if I need to. Well, that's what I thought until I went through each outfit one by one and realised there's an awful lot of players I'd blast in a heartbeat. So, here are my very scientific findings: Shoot on sight You could be the nicest person on Earth, but if that's the case, you're we…",

It measures the percentage of wage value of skills that AI systems can perform within each occupation, revealing where human and AI capabilities overlap.\" “Basically, we are creating a digital twin for the US labor market,” Prasanna Balaprakash, ORNL director and co-leader of the research, told CNBC . The Index works by treating the US's 151 million workers as individual autonomous agents, each tagged with various skills, occupations and locations. The model includes 32,000 skills, and 923 occupations across 3,000 counties, then measures where current AI systems can already perform those skills. It then calcul…",

Those of you hip to pattern recognition might note that those predecessor games seemed to get multiple expansions (Origins, likewise, got multiple), but it seems that won't be the case for Shadows. In a chat with JorRaptor (via IGN ), the game's associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois said that, \"at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned, currently.\" Which is a tad surprising, given Ubisoft's recent statement that the game is \" Overperforming \" against its expectations. I think the wording here is worth bearing in mind. Ubi's got no mondo-size expansions in the pipe, but Lemay-Comtois notes that \"We're still working on content for post-launch, and supporting it,\" so it's not quite as though the game is just being dropped.

But I really don't think any of these solutions are viable options. Issues with free loadout players have been exacerbated by Stella Montis, the smallest and most aggressive map in Arc Raiders, as players are seeing more killer free loadouters than usual. People who use free loadouts get given a low-level gun, ammo, shield, and health, not a lot, but enough to do well, but with none of their stuff on the line, so they can be more aggressive than usual. (Image credit: Embark Studios) \"I like how the game is PVP I just feel like those free loadouts are aggressive, careless and rush in with no worries,\" one player says . I've certainly played carelessly with nothing on the line, and there are a good chunk of players who use free loadouts as a way to grief other players with no consequences. Just the other day, my squad encountered a couple of free loadouts who just wanted to scrap. We loaded in at the start of the game, and within a few minutes, sho…",

You can slide halfway across the globe and follow it up with a shotgun blast before rolling back at the speed of light. These are examples of useful, nigh on game-breaking movement tricks that I'm not sure were ever intended, but I kind of hope they stick around given how cool they are. On the opposite side of the spectrum is this, a wall…shimmy? Basically, by grabbing a ledge, pressing forward and either left or right sideways movement, and holding the jump button, you're able to jump along the ledge. You'll drain stamina, so it's not quite infinite as the YouTuber above, Jiibii, says. But it's not all that intensive. It's a neat trick and something I had no clue you could do, and most importantly, something I'd never have figured out myself because, well, I'm not quite sure where it's actually practical.

Reputable leaker Golden Pig Upgrade Pack on Weibo (via VideoCardz ) claims Nvidia is planning to stop bundling VRAM with its GPU dies. Nvidia always supplied both the GPU and the VRAM to its add-in card (AIC) partners... well, potentially up until now. This made it easier for GPU manufacturers to stay on spec, but also removed the need for them to source DRAM directly from memory giants like Micron or Samsung. So, Nvidia took care of the VRAM and the GPU die, and the AIC did whatever they wanted with the rest of it, customizing the graphics card before selling it. If Nvidia has indeed decided to only ship the GPU going forward, its board partners will now need to secure VRAM all on their own. Given how volatile normal memory pricing is right now , that could be a challenge for some brands. The short supply of memory doesn't just affect the RAM kits we stick in our PCs.

This news comes somewhat cryptically from one of the most reliable leakers in the business, kopite7kimi (via WCCFTech ). It's a slightly convoluted data trail. But to cut a long story short, kopite7kimi responded to a story discussing 144 MB verticle cache allocations, which is expected to be known as bLLC or big last level cache in Intel parlance. For certain versions of Intel's upcoming Nova Lake CPUs, kopite7kimi clarified that there will be models with two compute tiles and thus double the stacked cache. So, according to this information, the top Intel Nova Lake CPU will have two compute tiles, each with eight Performance and 16 Efficient cores, plus 144 MB of vertical cache or bLLC.

That's Dog Witch in a nutshell really. Its take on roguelike deckbuilding is minimalist, streamlined, and charmingly chill. (Image credit: Heckmouse) In each round of its turn-based battles, you roll a handful of dice, with different faces granting you different effects. The friend symbol, for example, lets you summon a little minion to fight with you, while a bone grants you armour against an enemy hit. As you choose and apply effects, at any point you can choose to re-roll all of your dice up to twice, to fish for specific ones you need. And… that's kind of it. There is some gentle nuance to it. Wands, for example, let you apply damage directly to an enemy, but need to be charged with books to gain damage. Mana stacks up until you have enough to cast a spell, at which point all mana faces become your equipped spell instead, freely cast until the end of the turn. And stopwatches have a chance to stun enemies, or else reduce their resistance for a better chance to stun them next time. (Image credit: Heckmou…",

JRPGs in particular seem to be largely opposed to letting us play dress-up, but western RPGs tend to give us a few more options—both cosmetic and practical. And then there are those that let you completely override the appearance of your gear, so you can pick whatever fit tickles your fancy.

That certainly helped—it's one of the few TV shows that spans generations—but more important are the balanced loot pool with plenty of powerful weapons, a fully themed map overflowing with easter eggs, cartoonish overblown mechanics (a revolver than attaches a floaty balloon to players being the standout), lots of movement items and a smaller map, helping trim the mid-round lull you often get in Battle Royale. It's a huge contrast to the recent Star Wars mini-season, which dropped a few themed locations on a big, existing map and whose signature weapons—lightsabers—were underwhelming.

    "body": "Baldur's Gate 3 is well over two years old and its developer is no longer making major content additions, but its players are still finding fresh and exciting ways to crack open its ruleset towards their own gamebreaking ends. This week, as spotted by GamesRadar , BG3 players have found a way to recruit a fighting force of the most powerful beings in Larian's version of Faerun. It's children. They're building armies of children. The process is laid out in a YouTube short from BG3 aficionado and seeming evil mastermind Morgana Evelyn titled \"Child Labour is Unbeatable.\" That name alone should tell you what kind of moral dimensions we're working with here. If the idea of conscripting a horde of combat orphans doesn't pass your ethical sniff test, you probably won't enjoy where the rest of this goes. To pull this off, you'll need a level 7 Companion character with access to the Dominate Beast and Polymorph spells. With that character, you'll need to select your ideal child combatant—or because they all perform identically, any child combatant—and polymorph them. Once they're in sheep shape, hit them with Dominate Beast, and then travel to your camp. Once there, Morgana recommends ena…",

When played on (or even near) those laptops, the song would cause the drives to malfunction—and it was such a widespread problem that Microsoft incorporated code into Windows XP to filter out that particular frequency. Sounds unbelievable, but it's true! Audio experts, laptop makers and Windows developers all worked together to confirm the story—so when I was re-reading the 2022 Microsoft blog that first made the story news, I suddenly found myself wondering what other damage precisely the right (or, I suppose, wrong) sound frequency could do. For example: Could you cause a chicken's head to explode with just the power of sound? A comment on the 2022 blog casually suggests that perhaps such a thing is possible. \"There is also the story of the resonant frequency of chicken skulls from the old Borland Turbo C++ documentation,\" it says. And it's not the only place on the internet you'll find reference to this story. In 2009, a Redditor on r/programming also linked to it , asking…",

Yep, despite hosting nonstop sale events all year along, this is the first one formally branded around post-Thanksgiving consumerism. It's not one of Steam's \"big\" sales of the year—the kind that takes over the entire store page and gives away stickers—but it does have one standout deal that you should really consider for the FPS enjoyer in your life. Doom: The Dark Ages is on sale at 50% off, marked down to $34.99 . That's a tremendous deal on one of the best (and only) big budget singleplayer shooters in recent years, especially considering it's barely six months old. Is it the best Doom of the modern trilogy? No, but id gave itself a tough act to follow, and The Dark Ages is still gigantic and impressive in different ways than Doom '16 and its 2020 followup, Eternal. As I wrote in my 80% Doom: The Dark Ages review back in May: \"This is Doom at its most indulgent and deliciously violent, but it's also dumbed down and undeniably the easiest of the trilogy.

We're committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout.\" The \" consultation process \" is a requirement of UK law (Splash Damage is a UK-based studio) that takes place prior to layoffs: It grants employees the right to know why they're being laid off, and to explore other possible alternatives.

It convinced me that Paralives is going to avoid the biggest flaw in Inzoi's early access: a lifeless Live Mode. The whole 45 minutes of new gameplay takes place with a single playable \"para\" in his small flat and the shopping square below it. That may sound like a red flag for the state of the game, but I was way less worried about seeing the breadth of the Paralives neighborhood and more interested in the depth of its simulation. Some things that piqued my interest: The daily local newspaper that gives some in-world ideas for activities you should pursue Really prominent skill progress bars and skill level up notifications Conversation system that encourages you to choose between options, not spam the same interaction Personality trait upgrades that give gameplay buffs like playing music to remove sad emotions Contextual moods like being embar…",
