Absolutely none of which is the great news I mentioned.

Daddy Rank. What's Daddy Rank? You might think it's something that Kiryu has maxed out just, like, intrinsically, but it is in fact \"a rank that represents Kiryu's growth as a caretaker\" at the orphanage he runs in Kiwami 3, like the real bastard organised criminal he is. \"Lacking experience in housekeeping, Kiryu will improve his skills and learn a wider range of recipes, cooking dishes that kids request to unlock heartwarming new stories.\" You won't get this kind of action in GTA 6.

Could that—even, should that—model apply to the Steam Machine? The publishing director of Larian Studios, the outfit behind Baldur's Gate 3 among other high-profile games, clearly thinks so. I know subsidising hardware is unfashionable now but surely they're losing far more than a ~200$ difference by not having people on the storefront, which is essentially a money printing machine.

Arc Forge's most impressive feature, and why I've come to use it, is how it displays the crafting, recycling, salvaging, and repair values for all the items in a neat 'crafting glyph' chart.

Spotted by MP1st , the European trademark filing wasn't made by Remedy but by a company called Nordia Law, a law firm with offices in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, where Remedy is based. But Nordia does have a history with Remedy: It provided legal advice to the studio in its Control 2 contract negotiations with 505 Games, for instance, (a deal that has since been undone ) and also assisted in negotiating financing deals with Tencent and Annapurna . So there's some real history there. It's no secret that a Control sequel is in development: Remedy said so back in 2022. Whether Control Resonant is that sequel is an open question, however. The trademark filing covers a lot of ground, from \"computer gaming software\" to \"printed matter\" like books and magazines, television shows, movies, music, clothing, and even, for some reason, \"lanyards for holding keys.\" It's pretty broad, in other words, and the title could be a reference to something other than a new …",

Well, here's an early heads up: The RAM apocalypse/hellscape/nightmare we're living in right now isn't about to get any better, says Maingear CEO Wallace Santos (via Wccftech ). Given how expensive RAM is right now, many gamers are holding off on their upgrades in the hopes that the market will improve in the next few months. It makes sense—when you're seeing RAM kits sold for twice the price that they used to be sold for, it's hard not to want to wait it out. The Black Friday sales have only highlighted this, when we look back at the offers around Prime Day in July—just over four months ago, remember—we've seen prices rising from $170 for a 64 GB DDR5 kit to at least $600.

For those who have been following his channel for a while though, this won't come as much of a surprise. Eight years ago, a video titled \"Why I don't play video games anymore\" was uploaded to the PewDiePie channel, explaining the reasons behind the lack of Let's Play videos. Since then, his channel has adapted into more lifestyle blogging and the occasional hobby vlog. Of course, there are a few games sprinkled in, with the most recent video featuring Geoguessr. But aside from that, it's not the content you would've expected to see ten years ago. There's a good reason for this though, which PewDiePie explains in the November Kjellberg Mail newsletter. He shared, \"Since becoming a dad, everything does get evaluated differently. Every hour has weight now in a way it didn't before. One of the biggest things I decided to drop was videogames. But here's the thing: if I really wanted to, there'd be plenty of time for me to play videogames. I've just decided that, if time is limited, I'd rather be doing some…",

The disclosure indicates that AI has seeped into a fair chunk of the game, touching \"Background signboard textures, records illustrations, InfoCast videos,\" as well as \"Voices and music.\" Which is a real bummer, if you ask me.

    "body": "Bad news for fans of Cherry keyboards. Although the company's actual keebs don't rank on our list of the best gaming keyboards , the switches are in a league of their own—or they used to be, at least. However, Cherry seems to have fallen on hard times, with a net loss of $23 million (20.4 million euros) between January and the end of September 2025. This was with a turnover of nearly $82 million (70.7 million euros), leaving the company with more debt than equity. The future of its Peripherals division is also uncertain, and that's why it's hard to predict what will even happen to these keyboards in the future. According to Heise , Cherry is considering selling either its Peripherals division, which includes all its keyboards and mice, or the Digital Health & Solutions division. Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general \"peripherals\" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.

By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs, even its AI-specific GPUs as opposed to its gaming GPUs, are more general purpose in nature. The parallel here is bitcoin mining, which used to be done on graphics cards before a new generation of dedicated mining chips, also ASICs, came along and did the same job much more efficiently. Could the same transition from more general purpose GPUs to ASICs hit the AI industry? The Chinese startup is Zhonghao Xinying. Its Ghana chip is claimed to offer 1.5 times the performance of Nvidia's…",

Speaking to GamesRadar via interpreter, director Choi Ji-won is honoured to receive the accolade: \"I'm so happy that I'm lost for words right now … we didn't just view it as just pure expansion, but almost as a sequel and a brand new project.\" As for the actual Lies of P sequel that's in the works, Choi Ji-Won asks fans to \"please stay tuned for it; we are working really hard, and I will not disappoint you at all.\" And you know what, I fully believe him. Overture is, in my humble opinion, one of the best DLCs released for a soulslike game period—it's imaginative and well-designed, sure, but it also marks Neowiz finally finding its legs after a game that initially struck critics ( including us, I'm sorry to say ) as a Bloodborne carbon copy.

It will, however, be charging money for the first of several new \"Paradox Classes\" coming out alongside it. This is despite the fact that, when it was Kickstarted , Last Epoch promised, \"The only form of real money microtransactions Last Epoch will ever have are cosmetic\" and a \"one-time payment will be all that a player will have to spend to have the complete Last Epoch experience and be on the same footing as other players.\" Last Epoch's overall Steam rating of Very Positive now stands in marked contrast to its Mixed rating based on recent reviews, only 42% of which have been positive.

This build, and a release build with debug features enabled as well as another drive with the DLC, were found on a pair of Xbox 360 dev kits in a second-hand store where they'd been sitting for a year.

For instance, it's long been known that Mr. House originally had a second securitron girlfriend named Marilyn—she's on one of the playing cards that came with the collector's edition, and there's a mod to restore her along with the single voice line left in the release version.

And what's happening today is like, as we say, nobody really understands what's happening.\" It's the same sentiment he expressed on stage when Sandfall Interactive claimed the Golden Joysticks' Ultimate Game of the Year title, one of seven trophies it took that night: \" What the fuck is happening right now? \" Broche tried to expand on that feeling a little bit in his post-show comments. \"It's a weird feeling, when you put your heart out into the world and the world embraces it and gives you so much love back,\" he continued. \"We get so much love from the players ... it's so …",

A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct. For those who haven't seen Kill Bill, or maybe just forgot, one of the film's secondary fights is a showdown between The Bride and Gogo Yubari , a teenage psycho killer in the employ of O-Ren Ishii, head of the yakuza in Tokyo. Gogo dies, rather badly (spoiler, sorry), and then, well, so does everyone else. The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film. Based on the teaser, Yuki is basically Gogo, except maybe a little psychotically peppier and with a fondness for guns rather than a meteor hammer.

What if you exploit the doors now: 😂 https://t.co/JndqMjMpUn pic.twitter.com/81aFPE0ucD November 27, 2025 You can see it in action as Scrappy (not the chicken; an Arc Raiders player ) decides to put it to the test and glitch through the door. Scrappy is then met with a wave of flames via several flamethrowers, which are built into the walls. Tragically, the flames engulfed them before they could make it back out of the room. I'm not sure whether this is the simplest fix, but the devs certainly get points for creativity. But the locked room glitch …",

Those of you hip to pattern recognition might note that those predecessor games seemed to get multiple expansions (Origins, likewise, got multiple), but it seems that won't be the case for Shadows. In a chat with JorRaptor (via IGN ), the game's associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois said that, \"at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned, currently.\" Which is a tad surprising, given Ubisoft's recent statement that the game is \" Overperforming \" against its expectations. I think the wording here is worth bearing in mind. Ubi's got no mondo-size expansions in the pipe, but Lemay-Comtois notes that \"We're still working on content for post-launch, and supporting it,\" so it's not quite as though the game is just being dropped.

Sega's announced that, when Yakuza 0's spruced-up Director's Cut releases on December 8, the original version's getting delisted. So far, Sega's only said it's getting delisted on Steam, and I'm not sure if that will also apply to other storefronts. I've reached out to Sega to ask about this, and will update if I hear back. You might think that's not such a big deal. After all, the Director's Cut will contain all the parts of the original game inside it like a beautiful criminal pupa, but the shift also entails a big change in the game's price.

It seems that the RAM shortage that has us all mourning the not-so-terrible prices of a few months ago might now also open the door to a GPU shortage, and small GPU vendors will be hit the hardest. Reputable leaker Golden Pig Upgrade Pack on Weibo (via VideoCardz ) claims Nvidia is planning to stop bundling VRAM with its GPU dies. Nvidia always supplied both the GPU and the VRAM to its add-in card (AIC) partners... well, potentially up until now. This made it easier for GPU manufacturers to stay on spec, but also removed the need for them to source DRAM directly from memory giants like Micron or Samsung. So, Nvidia took care of the VRAM and the GPU die, and the AIC did whatever they wanted with the rest of it, customizing the graphics card before selling it. If Nvidia has indeed decided to only ship the GPU going forward, its board partners will now need to secure VRAM all on their own. Given how volatile normal memory pricing is right now , that could be a challenge for some brands. The short supply of memory doesn't just affect the RAM kits we stick in our PCs. It will extends to VRAM, too, with production being pointed towa…",

This news comes somewhat cryptically from one of the most reliable leakers in the business, kopite7kimi (via WCCFTech ). It's a slightly convoluted data trail. But to cut a long story short, kopite7kimi responded to a story discussing 144 MB verticle cache allocations, which is expected to be known as bLLC or big last level cache in Intel parlance. For certain versions of Intel's upcoming Nova Lake CPUs, kopite7kimi clarified that there will be models with two compute tiles and thus double the stacked cache. So, according to this information, the top Intel Nova Lake CPU will have two compute tiles, each with eight Performance and 16 Efficient cores, plus 144 MB of vertical cache or bLLC. That makes for a total of 48 cores and 288 MB of Intel's equivalent to AMD V-Cache. The chips will also have another four low-power Efficient cores located in the SoC tile, making for a…",

Mana stacks up until you have enough to cast a spell, at which point all mana faces become your equipped spell instead, freely cast until the end of the turn.

We haven’t changed our memory pricing, but we did have to delist standalone memory from our Marketplace to head off scalpers and preserve inventory for people buying it with our DIY Edition laptops. https://t.co/4zDF9QvnkA November 25, 2025 \"The memory market is in a bad spot.
