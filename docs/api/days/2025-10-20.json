That's not exactly a smoking gun, given that Del Rey has an album coming out and this could be an unrelated song that just happens to have the same name. But come on, Lana Del Rey would be a perfect fit for a Bond theme of the smoky Nancy Sinatra variety. I reckon she could manage a brassier Shirley Bassey-type song too. And it would be justice for the fact she wrote a theme for Spectre that ultimately went unused in favor of Sam Smith's song, Writing's On the Wall. (The song Del Rey wrote for it was eventually released under the name 24 , Spectre being the 24th Bond movie.) After seeing 30 minutes of 007 First Light gameplay , our Tyler Wilde came away surprised by how impressive the shooting was. While there's gunplay in IO Interactive's Hitman games, it's never been the main attraction—if you end up going loud it's usually because something's gone wrong.

Developer Renegade Kid originally pitched it to Konami as a Silent Hill game. As director Jools Watsham told NintendoLife , \"The person I met with from Konami was rather dismissive and said something to the effect of, 'We wouldn’t give the Silent Hill IP to a team like yours'. It was quite surprising and very disheartening.\" Renegade Kid tried again years later, using the engine from Dementium 2 to mock up a third-person game to pitch to Konami. \"Konami's response that time wasn't dismissive like the first time,\" Watsham told IGN . \"They simply didn't want to venture into the DS space with a horror title at that time.\" The trailer sure makes Dementium look a lot more like Doom 3 than Silent Hill 2, so I can't say I'm disappointed Renegade Kid had to come up with their own mythos rather than borrowing Silent…",

Two heavy hitters—the reboot of Bungie's venerable shooter Marathon and Embark's fresh up-and-comer Arc Raiders —are nearly here, and both have had a chance to gear up with playtests. Speaking with PC Gamer US editor-in-chief Tyler Wilde, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins said the shared timing made for a fortuitous opportunity. \"It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen,\" Watkins said. \"It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out.\" Of course, Arc Raiders and Marathon are different games, but it's hard not to compare the two. Timing aside, when PC Gamer staff writer Morgan Park played both back-to-back earlier this year, he noted \"both studios need their extraction shooters to be a hit,\" adding he was \"skeptical there's enough interest in the inherently un-casual genre to support them both.\" For Watki…",

    "body": "Rory Norris, Guides Writer (Image credit: Future) Last week I was: getting stuck into Battlefield 6, testing out weapons and all the new maps in the launch version. This week I've been: trying to unlock every weapon in Battlefield 6 before Season 1. It's been almost four years since the last Battlefield game, 2042, and nearly a decade since the last truly great one. The multiplayer FPS landscape has changed a lot in that time, flip-flopping on concepts like 'hero' characters, movement, and more, but Battlefield 6 's insistence on returning to its series core was certainly the right thing to do. For one, it stole the Call of Duty Black Ops 7 beta's thunder, hitting a peak of 747k concurrent players on Steam alone. Despite this sweeping success, one criticism is shouted louder than all else: \"We want large maps\". It was, rightly so, a contentious topic during the beta, and it's only worsened since then, now that we've had our hands on what Battlefield Studios considers to be a big map. As a series veteran, I think it's safe to say that none of these maps are particularly large, and I do hope we get more diversity going forward. That said, I'd say Liberation Peak, Mirak Valley, and N…",

The technology's experimental use in the arts has already seen the advent of AI \"musicians\" like The Velvet Sundown , and you might wonder whether a veteran like Uematsu would be allured or even threatened by the ability to spin melodies so quickly with generative AI tools. As reported by Automaton , Uematsu told JASRAC he \"never used AI and probably never will … music produced by people is unstable, and everyone does it in their own unique way. And what makes it sound so satisfying are precisely those fluctuations and imperfections.\" Uematsu has shared concerns about the changing face of videogame music before. Last year, he said there's a worrisome wave of game directors content with \"Hollywood-style\" music, adding even then that AI tools would prevent composers from \"reaching deep down inside yourself to find aspects unique to you and then expressing them.\" More recently, he lamented a perceived stagnation in game music, with too many composers aping John Williams.

Fair Games' pixel-y fantasy romp first stepped onto the road back in 2019, and only revealed it was prepping for a 1.0 launch during this year's PC Gaming Show . Now, Necesse is not done, exactly, but feature-complete as far as Fair Games' main plans for it went. The 1.0 update introduces multiple significant changes to its fantasy world, the biggest of which is, well, the world. Up to this point, Necesse's world was built from a limited scattering of islands. But the 1.0 update introduces a completely new system that generates an infinite, seamless map, letting you explore freely across a vast continent, journeying between its many biomes that are now designed to blend into one another rather than being separated out. Handily, Necesse supports migrating your existing world to the new generation format, though the developers encourage players to start a new game to experience the world afresh. Elsewhere, the 1.0 update overhauls Necesse's balance and progressio…",

But this pencil-scrawl to your local newsagent nonetheless has a few landmarks worth visiting between now and the end of the year. The most significant of these is probably new game plus, which Techland describes as being \"highly anticipated\" in its Steam post detailing the roadmap. Personally, the absolute last thing I want to do after putting a 30+ hour game to bed is immediately start playing it again, but it appears I am in the minority on this. Elsewhere, the next few weeks will also introduce 'Legend Levels', a new nightmare difficulty, extra weapon executions, and ray tracing on PC. Techland doesn't specify precisely when each of these updates will arrive, but my guess is they'll be drip-fed alongside the roadmap's initial reveal—a series of weekly community challenges Techland has dubbed 'Call of the Beast'.

    "body": "Final Fantasy 7 Remake took the first eight or so hours of Final Fantasy 7 and expanded them into a 30-hour prestige RPG that, while it contained some quite skippable sidequests, added to the story in ways that made it even more impactful. The additions deepened character relationships and made you feel more attached to the setting. By contrast, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth took the original's second act and bloated it into 50+ hours of open world RPG filler. It wasn't just the optional tower-climbing and chocobo-stealthing stuff that made Rebirth feel stretched. Even if you stuck to the critical-path story you'd have to slog through Cait Sith throwing boxes around, an overlong final dungeon, and a plot you had to move through at a crawl—sometimes literally. Screenrant recently spoke to Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, and brought up some of these complaints. \"Regarding time management in certain sections,\" he replied, \"especially in FF7 Rebirth, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary. I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly.…",

But the plan then was to release Arc in October (although the date hadn't yet been announced) and it stayed that way, because despite the fans angling for a surprise drop, it was \"absolutely not ready,\" design director Virgil Watkins told PC Gamer in an interview this week. \"It was interesting to see how many people wanted us to drop it, or even shortly after [the playtest], expected us to drop the game,\" said Watkins. \"But on our end, the game was absolutely not ready.

When that suit was filed, the team behind the private server issued a statement: \"Turtle WoW is here to stay.\" Yesterday, October 17, they issued another: An open letter to Blizzard itself, requesting a licensing framework for fan mods and private servers. The letter, which you can find in full on the front page of the Turtle WoW website, gets into the history and arguable inevitability of fanmade mods. \"Many successful games have a modding community.

Its rough and ready demo oozes with the same the lo-fi tension of William Friedkin's Sorcerer , a nihilistic thriller that was critically panned and buried at the box office by the runaway success of Star Wars, but has been (rightly) reappraised in subsequent years. If you haven't seen Sorcerer, I strongly recommend you check it out. But in the meantime, you can think of Nitroglycerine! as a mix of Snowrunner and Baby Steps . The playable demo skips the surprisingly long setup of Friedkin's film, planting your straight in the cabin of a snorting, grunting '70s flatbed loaded with a single crate of pure liquid concussion. You're then tasked with navigating a twisting morass of slippery, crumbling dirt tracks with nothing but a crude map and nerves of steel. You get three trucks and three opportunities with which to complete the journey, while gas stations you pass serve as checkpoints. In my initial run, I only reached the first checkpoint before blowing all three trucks to kingdom come. The chall…",

The studio has worked minor miracles with handheld ports too, most notably the Nintendo Switch version of 2020's Doom Eternal . That said, The Dark Ages was the first Doom game to be fully and constantly ray-traced, making it a less obvious candidate for handheld gaming when it launched. While it ran well enough on most PC hardware and could even deliver reasonable framerates on a cheap gaming laptop, as Andy Edser noted in his PC performance analysis , the Steam Deck nonetheless struggled to meet its minimum requirements, and as such performance was underwhelming. But that's all changed, apparently. Update 2.2 introduces several handheld-centric optimisations and quality-of-life features. This includes general performance improvements and advanced optimisation settings for handheld devices, as well as more performant SFX and VFX when gaming on the go.

Specifically, you're a house who eats furniture, loves fishing, and even knows how to jump. As a house, you roll around this island at sometimes ridiculous speeds, chatting with different buildings and going on dates with them. I saw Building Relationships at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show on Saturday. It's a funny game but, crucially, it's not just funny because you're a building. It's also funny in the same way Baby Steps is: there's something inherently comical about the moment-to-moment movement, the bonkers physics, and the sense that you're always in control but only just. When the seductive protagonist does find a date—perhaps with a charismatic windmill, or a friendly manor, or a \"himbo\" tent—the process proceeds as a mini-game. For example, as my house dined with a grand old abode, I had to put together a flat-pack table for my romantic interest to eat (because buildings eat furniture, obviously). Building Relationships is predominantly the work of Thai developer Tanat Boozayaangool, who cites A Short Hike as inspiration. \"It's a he…",

That number, courtesy of SteamDB , is good enough to put Arc Raiders in the number four spot on Steam's most played list , ahead of PUBG, Rust, and Bongo Cat. It's even more impressive when you consider that the server slam is also available on the Epic Games Store as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, meaning the actual number of people playing is higher—likely much higher. Despite the enviable crush of players, the test seems to be going very well. Embark Studios pushed a hotfix shortly after the playtest started to address crashes and errors, which unfortunately required a \"full redownload\" of the game, but said that \"should not be the norm moving forward.\" Since that patch, though, there's been no indication of big issues: Two of our best men, Morgan Park and Lincoln Carpenter, are apparently spending their Friday, uhh, testing the game , and say they haven't run into any issues.

The \"why\" seemed obvious enough: Light of Motiram really did look an awful lot like Horizon: Zero Dawn, in some very overt ways. Despite Tencent's lack of comment, I assumed the store page changes, and the huge two-year delay, represented a fairly complete walkback and rework. But it seems that Sony isn't buying it: As reported by Games Fray , Sony has now filed for a preliminary injunction against Tencent's use of any material \"copied or derived\" from the Horizon games. That covers a lot of ground, but the filing focuses heavily on Tencent's use of a character in Light of Motiram promotional images who looks a lot like Alo…",

There's joy to be found in mundane retail work when your real-life livelihood doesn't depend on enduring its regular horrors.

By my count, there are currently at least four different games in development about operating convenience stores while surviving—or in some cases, facilitating—a variety of interplanetary, unholy, and undead terrors.

One other reason to get excited is Sports Interactive's deal with the English Premier League, arguably the greatest club league in the world, and now it has announced another biggie: a multi-year deal with FIFA , football's world governing body, that gives FM 26 and its successors the license to multiple international competitions, most notably FIFA World Cup 26. The World Cup is obviously as big as sport gets, and next year's competition will be held across Canada, Mexico, and the USA.

Needless to say, part of this new housing system is furniture. When the housing system launches, players will earn decor relating to achievements and existing in-game content: but this will also work retroactively, so achievements earned now will count toward furniture when housing goes live. The housing system is already live on WoW's Public Test Realm for the early birds, so players know what these achievements are. I'm sure you can see where this is going. A new add-on called Home Bound by Bettiold ( available on CurseForge ) essentially tells players which achievements they should be gunning for in the runup to the release of the full housing system, whereupon they'll be showered with all their hard-earned furniture.
