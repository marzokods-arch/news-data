Since 2024, it has been known that Samsung is also working on smart glasses that carry the codename “Haean.” A new report provides a few new details about Samsung’s next XR device.

A new analysis of data from NASA’s Cassini mission found evidence of previously undetected organic compounds in a plume of ice particles ejected from the ocean that lies under the frozen shell of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Researchers spotted not only molecules they’ve found before but also new ones that lay a potential path to chemical or biochemical activity. The ice grains studied were collected just 13 miles (21 kilometers) from the moon’s surface and mark the first time scientists have observed this diversity of organics in fresh particles ejected from the subsurface water of Enceladus.

And then finally: Which previously ineligible bands will soon be up for voting for the first time — and do any of them have a real chance of getting in? With this year&#8217;s Rock Hall induction finally happening this month, we think it&#8217;s a good time to look back on rock&#8217;s history — from the very beginning up until this century — and figure out which rock bands we at Billboard think still serve as the benchmarks for greatness.

The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses.

The charging case may also include speakers similar to Apple’s AirPods cases for sound-based locator features. We’ve shared plenty of information already about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro , which is expected to launch alongside the Galaxy S26 series early next year. Thanks to our leaked renders, we have a good idea of what the earbuds will look like in both white and black colors. We are also aware of new features, such as Head Gestures, that could potentially delight Samsung fans.

Google’s announcement comes hot on the heels of OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 model, which only released a week ago for all ChatGPT users. Gemini 3 boasts better reasoning and multimodal capabilities. In fact, Google’s testing indicates that the new model beats OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 in almost every single AI intelligence benchmark. It’s also vastly better at coding as my colleague Mishaal showcased by building entire Android apps in little time.",

Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment.

Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini overlays have been two remarkable ways to let Gemini view content from other apps. But their application remains limited since the overlay closes as soon as we switch back to the other app. The other alternative is to share your screen with Gemini Live , but that may not match the regular interface in terms of functionality. Now, Google may be working to partially solve that by allowing Gemini to interpret another app’s content, though the application may be limited to a specific set of devices.

While Rebble and Core Devices had initially agreed to work together, the former now claims to disagree over the terms. Rebble alleges that Pebble’s founder, Eric Migicovsky, could build a “walled garden,” restricting further open-source app development. Update: Nov 19, 2025 (1:55 AM ET): Eric Migicovsky responded with a blog explaining his stance. He says while the agreement between Rebble and Core includes a licensing fee of $0.20 per user per month, Rebble assert a 100% claim on its app store data. He counter-accused Pebble of “attempting to create a walled garden around 13,000 apps and faces that individual Pebble developers created and uploaded to the Pebble Appstore between 2012 and 2016,” and added he’s “working hard to keep the Pebble ecosystem open source.”",

After weeks of negotiations between YouTube and Disney, YouTube TV subscribers finally learned they’ll get ESPN Unlimited at no extra cost. Unfortunately, there’s a catch. It looks like one of the most valuable sports packages still won’t be part of the deal. According to a new report from Puck’s John Ourand , MLB.TV will not be part of the ESPN Unlimited experience on YouTube TV, even after it moves under ESPN’s umbrella next year.",

It’s unclear how many users are being offered this deal, as some have not yet received the message. This offer is different from the previous $10 off for six months deal sent out earlier this month. It was a lengthy holdout, but YouTube TV and Disney finally settled their dispute late last week. Over the course of the standoff, YouTube TV inevitably lost some of its subscribers, but also managed to keep some by offering viewers $20 off their bill . Now, YouTube TV is attempting to lure those who left to come back with a new discount. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Mobile phone thefts, usually snatch-and-grabs, are rising, but thieves reportedly prefer iPhones due to their enhanced resale value. Since thieves don’t want your Samsung Galaxy phone, you might get to keep it in the event of a robbery. It’s safe to say that, in 2025, the notion that Android phones are cheaper than iPhones simply isn’t true. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs more than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and that’s without getting into the foldable phone market, where Samsung charges $2,000 for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. In fact, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold could hit the $3,000 mark . Phone thieves apparently didn’t get the memo. Smartphone theft is rampant in the London, with the UK’s Metropolitan Police reporting 117,211 mobile phone thefts in the city in 2024 alone. While the Metropolitan Police doesn’t track theft data by smartphone brand, it appears thieves have a preference.

Google parent company Alphabet’s stock price has doubled this year as Google has built out AI efforts. The breakneck pace of investment in companies developing AI tech over the past few years has many onlookers convinced we’re currently in an AI bubble. Sundar Pichai knows the situation is serious: when the AI bubble bursts, “no company is going to be immune,” the Google CEO told the BBC . In an interview with the BBC at Google’s headquarters in California, Pichai drew parallels between today’s AI market and the 1990s dot-com boom, during which investment in internet startups reached a fever pitch before a crash saw tech firms lose trillions in market cap and shed tens of thousands of jobs. Back then, “There was clearly a lot of excess investment,” Pichai said, “but none of us would question whether the internet was profound.” Pichai said AI investment is in a similar spot today.",

The chatbot can write essays, brainstorm ideas, and even generate code, making it an important resource that many now rely on. But what if it’s not working for you? For those unfortunate times when ChatGPT is down, we’ve put together a list of potential solutions you can try to get it running again. Check if ChatGPT is down Give ChatGPT some time to recover Check your internet connection Log out and log back in Try incognito mode or a different browser Use the ChatGPT smartphone app Clear your browser’s settings and cache Try a ChatGPT alternative Check if ChatGPT is down The first thing you should do is check if the servers hosting ChatGPT itself are down right now or facing connectivity issues. Such disruptions were common in the early days of the service, as the company struggled to meet the ever-increasing user demand.",

But if you spend any amount of time around people who talk about digital minimalism, you start hearing the same familiar pitches. Switch to a dumb phone. Delete your apps. Turn everything grayscale. If you want to go a step further, lock your phone away. The advice always sounds great until you actually try living with it. For one, my job relies on technology and communication, and I can’t exactly turn off the dial on that. Moreover, most of us cannot simply retreat from the world. We need maps, banking, authentication , messaging, and the small conveniences that make everyday life function smoothly. That tension between wanting less and needing enough is where most of these experiments fall apart. At least they do for me. You either give up too much or you fall right back into the same cycle of tapping and scrolling without even knowing it.",

The camera also adds a variable aperture for better portrait effects and closer zoom. DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",

The Steam Deck currently only downloads and applies updates while powered on. The upcoming Steam Machine will apparently support more convenient background updating options. Last week, Valve surprised us with the announcement of three new hardware products . None of them were a second-generation Steam Deck, but a Valve hardware engineer teased that the company’s thinking about a requested quality-of-life update for its handheld: to allow docked Steam Decks to update automatically, the same way the upcoming Steam Machine can while it’s idle. According to The Verge , Valve’s Yazan Aldehayyat told the publication that automatic docked updates are “something we are really interested in supporting.” Aldehayyat didn’t commit to bringing the feature to Steam Deck, but that Valve is thinking about it at all seems like a good sign.",

The same issue occurs with AirPods, which, despite using Bluetooth as the medium, lack basic app controls when connected to a non-Apple device, resulting in a severely limited experience. Thankfully, there’s an app that addresses the limitations when AirPods are paired to Android devices .

Now, a leaker has made a rather audacious claim about the Apple foldable’s battery capacity. Korean blogger Yeux1122 has claimed that Apple is testing a 5,400 to 5,800mAh battery in the iPhone Fold. The tipster claims that Apple might settle on the larger capacity at the expense of a thicker, heavier design.",
