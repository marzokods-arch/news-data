    "body": "At first glance Realm of Ink looks like a flagrant Hades clone. Look closer, squint, and yes, it still looks like a flagrant Hades clone. But after a half-dozen hours spent with this China-developed roguelite, some of its more bonkers qualities shone through, such as the flexibility of its pet system, and the fact that depending on the build you stumble into, it can turn into something more akin to Vampire Survivors. This thing can get wildly broken, unashamedly so. The kind of broken where at some point the graphics surrender and let themselves be buried beneath overlapping damage numbers. That's what I like about it. Realm of Ink is set inside fictional books, hence the name. Most of the people and creatures you encounter don't know they're fictional entities, which could be why the voice acting is so bizarrely over-the-top, making your average Tales dub seem artful and restrained. I have to confess I quickly zoned out on the story, though the meticulously illustrated worlds kept my interest. These are far less elaborately animated compared to Hades, but they feel more distinctive. They're dreamy in their picture book woodenness, and the varying themes and color palettes all dra…",

Of course, we'll know a lot more when Redsec officially drops tomorrow. Here's exactly when that's happening. Battlefield RedSec release date and time for each region After weeks of rumors about an impending shadow drop, EA decided to give everyone a day's notice. Battlefield Redsec is out October 28 , but the exact timing depends on your region.

And equally, how few are playable anywhere but the DS, even 15 years after Nintendo stopped making new handhelds. Steam has seen HD remasters of some of the DS's best games over the years: Zero Escape Etrian Odyssey 1,2, and 3 Ace Attorney Trilogy Castlevania Dominus Collection Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective But it's a weirdly short list given just how many bangers came out on the DS over the course of its life.

(Image credit: Future) \"It's something I think Valve does not get anywhere near enough criticism about,\" Hall said. \"I'm honestly disgusted with gambling mechanics in videogames at all—they have absolutely no place.\" Efforts to regulate loot boxes as a form of gambling—like a recent Brazilian law banning the sale of loot boxes to minors—have driven other major games publishers to pursue different monetization tactics in recent years.

Psychopomp 1 used the grid-based, first person gameplay of old school dungeon crawlers like Legend of Grimrock to make something that plays closer to a PlayStation 2 survival horror game⁠—you move slowly and can't maneuver very well as you navigate dungeons full of slavering flesh beasts, while instead of spells and dice roll attacks, you just have to be close enough to enemies to whack them with a claw hammer. Psychopomp begins with its clearly disturbed (maybe divinely ordained?) protagonist spelunking in the nightmare dungeons hidden under innocuous public buildings before descending even further into a subterranean world, and eventually ringing in some kind of an apocalypse with a doppelganger planet summoned above Earth.

This multi-layered PCB is a fairly unique bit of hardware design, not only allowing for cleaner signal routing but also a neat little perch for a warm beverage. To be clear, I'm not recommending you crack open your extremely expensive GPU and fashion its pricey guts into a drinks coaster (though I bet that would look sick).

All of the PCB's major components are accurately represented within the printable 3D files.

So it's lovely to discover that Mechanicus 2 is shaping up to be even bigger and better. Playing the free demo currently available on Steam, I'm really impressed with how the core strategy has evolved. (Image credit: Bulwark Studios) In the first game's Adeptus Mechanicus vs Necron battles (think weirdo religious cyborgs vs ancient alien cyborgs, if you're unfamiliar), the key was a resource called cognition. Harvested from terminals and pillars in the environment, it was used to fuel special abilities and extra movement, but was shared across your whole team, forcing careful decision-making. For the sequel, that system's been ramped right up. Now, cognition is generated by units directly in ways that define their role on the team. Lumbering melee servitors, for example, grant you a point every time they take damage, while your Skitarii rangers instead generate one every time they shoot someone from far enough away.

For instance, original Halo designer Jaime Griesemer was vocally disappointed with the new remake , calling it out for mucking with the level design in a way he reckoned was deleterious for the game as a whole. Well, buckle up, because yet another Halo OG has entered the ring and this one's a lot more positive. Marcus Lehto, art director on Halo 1, 2 and 3 and \" father of Master Chief ,\" took to X to declare that he's a fair bit keener on the remake than his former compatriots. \"It warms my heart to see Halo CE like this,\" says the man himself. \"My honest impression of seeing the new Halo Campaign Evolved is this,\" wrote Lehto, \"I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine.

The Outer Worlds 2, despite getting a solid thumbs up by resident RPG sicko Ted Litchfield in his review , is no exception.

Also, to be fair, a few bonuses that are technically worth the price—two future DLCs, access to the artbook and soundtrack, and a couple of bundles with armours and weapons in them. Standard stuff. Oh, and also the privilege of Obsidian sticking its tongue out at you and going ner-ner. See, in The Outer Worlds 2, you can pick up optional \"Flaws\".

Thermaltake must have realised this because its latest AIO liquid CPU cooler has taken cooler screens to a new level, but it's also given it a whole bunch of neat extra features. The cooler in question is the Thermaltake Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB Sync (via Hermita Akiba on X ), and the name alone gives you all the clues you need to guess what the AIO cooler looks like, assuming you've not taken a gander at the images yet. Where most vendors have been content to add a single LCD screen to their AIO blocks, Thermaltake has added four individual displays to the Minecube: one facing straight up, and the other three forming a 'wrap-around' effect, starting on the rear IO side of the motherboard before finishing at the DRAM slots side. Admittedly, having a screen facing the rear IO panel doesn't make much sense, because you're barely going to see it in an average PC case. Anyway, using Thermaltake's software, you can apply individual animated GIFs to each panel or have them display hardware info, such as temperatures and clock …",

If you haven't played a Jurassic World Evolution game before, it is exactly what it says on the tin: a park-building simulator where you raise, research, and sell tickets to see dinosaurs, but it doesn't dare to step outside of that boundary. You'll create buildings, connect them to paths and power them with electricity before inviting guests, alongside sending out research teams to discover new species you'll eventually get to hatch and raise. The cycle continues. This time around, there are a few notable quality-of-life improvements, such as automating pesky maintenance tasks like repairing fences after a storm or caring for any sick dinosaurs, which makes park life a lot easier.

Or if you do get there, what you brought to the party no one wants to play anyway.\" As the article notes, Layden's tenure oversaw a trio of Sony's singleplayer knockouts, and part of why he left the company was due to their live-service pivot, which he quips were \"not my skillset.\" Layden oversaw God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima.

    "body": "Believe it or not, Black Friday is only a month away, so it won't be long before Amazon and every other major retailer will be tempting us with endless graphics card deals. Compared to the start of 2025, when GPUs were in short supply and prices for many models bordered on the ludicrous, the final quarter of 2025 is a much nicer affair. 👉 The best early Black Friday PC gaming deals right here 👈 Entry-level, budget, and most mainstream graphics cards are generally priced at or below their MSRP, despite import tariffs. It's only the likes of the Radeon RX 9070 XT and GeForce RTX 5090 that remain overpriced. We're expecting new graphics cards from Nvidia in the new year, when it launches the Super variants of its RTX 50-series cards. That means we could see big discounts on RTX 5070 and RTX 5080 cards, as retailers try to clear inventory. We could also see something new from AMD and Intel, but there hasn't been much gossip about these so far. When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 kicks off Friday, 28 November 2028 and runs for three days over the whole weekend. But even then, the annual sales bonanza isn't over, as it will be followed by Cyber Monday (1 December 2025) and Cy…",

We're already finding some superb machines with heavy discounts, so you can pick up one of the best gaming PCs at a great price from... now, actually. 👉 All the best Black Friday PC gaming deals are right here 👈 Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs are well-established at this point, which means those on a budget will want to look out for RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti gaming PCs. Mid-range buyers will be well-served by RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti machines, whereas if you've got the cash to splash, even RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 gaming PCs will be dropping in price. Oh, and don't rule out AMD GPUs, either. The RX 9060 XT is an excellent budget gaming graphics card, while the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are very quick mid-range performers. When it comes to CPUs, both AMD and Intel have excellent options to pick from, so it's dealers choice for the most part.

Johan Andersson, lead on Europa Universalis 5, said in an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens that the practice can be too rigid and restraining.

Kato and her commenters speak Japanese, and I didn't feel like I'd get anything worthwhile out of YouTube's auto-translation feature (which presumably draws from already-garbled auto-generated captions), but there's a universal language of horror at work here that makes the stream very easy to follow regardless.

The latest trailer does just that, by informing us that Boltgun 2 will let us choose a second playable character. That character being Nyra Veyrath, a Celestian of the Sisters of Battle, to be specific. She wields a bolt pistol/power sword combo, switching to a meltagun or flamer when the enemies of the Imperium need a good superheating, and has some good mobility, with a slide move I couldn't imagine the bulky space marine Malum Caedo pulling off. As well as letting us choose between two protagonists, Boltgun 2 will have a branching campaign, with different decisions leading you through different levels. It'll also have more biomes than the first game, including a jungle swamp and a hive city to fight through. Looks like there's an ice world too?
