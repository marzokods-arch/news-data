What's the best inventory system in PC gaming? Resident Evil 4 's grid-based briefcase has certainly echoed through the generations, though you could argue it simply builds upon work done in PC games like Deus Ex and System Shock 2. A cursory Internet search also brings up suggestions like Minecraft for its simplicity, and Death Stranding for how deeply inventory management is intertwined with the core experience. All of these are great for their own reasons, but for my money, juggling stuff in your backpack has never been better than as depicted in Neo Scavenger.

But the troubled city-builder has received some significant TLC lately. November's bike patch brought bicycles, scooters and associated infrastructure to player-created metropolises, and now, developer Colossal Order has finally added its hotly anticipated asset editor too. As Colossal Order concedes in a recent Steam post , development of the asset editor has been \"long underway\", with the community clamouring for it more or less since the sequel launched. The developer admitted in March that the editor had \"proven more technically challenging than initially anticipated\". Citing issues such as lingering Unity dependencies and the large amount of in-built assets affected by the editor's addition. In any case, those issues have seemingly been resolved. Colossal Order's aim with the asset editor is to let players \"create complex assets on par with official content\", and the tool has a few interesting features to make this easier for players.

In the clip, Lucy is up in the mouth of Dinky the T-Rex, the enormous plaster dinosaur that looks over the Dino Dee-lite motel and served once as the Dino Bite gift shop—as well as the sniper perch for Boone, the (unquestionably) best companion in Fallout: New Vegas. Take a look: As we can see in the clip, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) have been running a scam that sounds a bit like the con from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: turn over an outlaw (in this case, The Ghoul) to the authorities (who appear to be the Great Khans, a faction from Fallout: New Vegas) and collect the bounty.

Some think we'd better all just get used to it, like Epic CEO Tim Sweeney , who insists that \"AI will be involved in nearly all future production.\" Others have a less enthusiastic view, like Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser , who likened it to a tech equivalent of mad cow disease being pushed by \"a certain group of people, who maybe aren't fully-rounded humans.\" Howard, it seems, falls somewhere in the middle alongside figures like Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick , who in October said he…",

Tagawa was a classic 'that guy' actor, with IMDB listing credits in more than 140 films and television shows going back to an uncredited appearance in the 1986 Kurt Russell classic Big Trouble in Little China. It didn't take long for bigger roles to follow: I recall seeing him first in an episode of Babylon 5 (yes, I am a B5 nerd), in which he played a cool, quiet, capable guy who took care of a problem while other people focused on other things—a description that could probably be applied to many of his roles, really. Tagawa appeared in everything from big-budget films to long-forgotten TV series over his long career. In 1987 he was \"Asian buyer\" in an episode of MacGyver and \"Thug in Flashback\" in the low-budget action flick Bulletproof; he also had a speaking role as Chang in The Last Emperor, which won nine Academy Awards that same year. He turned up in everything from Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Walker, Texas Ranger to Planet of…",

Every season you can fill out a battle pass of sorts that unlocks fancy weapon skins, and people quickly spotted a curious looking weapon on the info page for the upcoming Season of Divine Intervention. Under \"additional bonus rewards\" there's a flail alongside a mace and a glaive, and unless they're giving necromancers a new weapon type, I think we're looking at a clear hint at paladins making their way to Sanctuary immediately.

Now it seems the game most likely to usurp it is Slay the Spire 2 , which is coming in March 2026—though there was apparently a 50% chance that the indie team at Mega Crit Games would never make a sequel. \"We had been working on a bunch of tiny projects, little prototypes, and were having fun but said 'okay, let's get together again,'\" Mega Crit co-founder Anthony Giovannetti told PC Gamer in an interview for The PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. This was during Covid, when the two were ready to tackle a project they could really sink their teeth into. That project being another Slay the Spire was not a given, despite having sold well over a million copies by then. \"We had different paths we could work on,\" Giovanetti said. \"One was a completely different project, and one was the sequel.

The reason this step is so hard is because it's entirely inaccurate; the Scholar is actually in The Great Hollow event. I guess that's technically in Limveld, even though it's an entirely different map. As you'll quickly discern from the Remembrance entries, the Undertaker is a nun who started consuming the night corruption, hence the rather questionable screenshots circulating of her licking night juice off the wall while the Scholar watches her. Hey, who am I to kink shame? As well as a walkthrough for all quest chapters, I've also included info for what you're supposed to do after Chapter 6 to get her Remembrance skin and ending.

Now illuminated having watched Jinko's latest Arc Raiders mythbusting video, I've learned that these players stuck in place are the result of forcing the game closed, such as the ol' ALT+F4 or disconnecting—not from being killed or even surrendering to return to the main menu.

Her response: “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” Su claims that fears around a potential bubble are \"somewhat overstated\". Unfortunately, as this is part of the Wired Big Interview series, and the larger interview hasn't been published yet, it's hard to fully surmise where Su's stance lies outside of this answer. In its barest form, a bubble is where the asset price in some industry far exceeds actual value, due in part to speculation. The 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble popping didn't mean people wouldn't buy houses or use the internet, but that the value tied up in it exceeded what it was worth, and those betting billions on it could no longer see a return on investment.

A lot of the times I jumped were because I'd clumsily run around a corner too quickly and bumped into an enemy, or a friend had shouted something after being sat in silence for ten minutes. However, the new update coming on Tuesday, December 9, not only adds a haunting new enemy, but an entirely new setting which already gives me the heebie-jeebies. In a trailer uploaded to the Red Barrels YouTube channel , Project Messiah has been revealed. This update plans to take us away from the sterile halls of the Murkoff facility and into what looks like a desolate lodge. Except, unlike a lot of churches I've been into, this one is filled with masked mannequins, statues, and of course—dead bodies. This is The Outlast Trials after all. But among all of the masked mannequins is Liliya Bogomolova, also referred to as Sister Liliya, who is adorned in an almost identical outfit to some of the mannequins.

That level of fortune gives one plenty of opportunities to spend hours reminiscing about the past, present, and future, which is precisely what Jensen Huang and Joe Rogan recently did. Specifically, for almost two and a half hours, Huang chatted on the Joe Rogan Experience about all things AI, GPU, CUDA, consciousness, and what have you. There's an awful lot to delve into, but I was particularly drawn to the section where Rogan remarks on Nvidia's massive AI growth and capabilities: \"How funny would it be that it [AI] is birthed out of the desire for computer graphics for video games? It's kind of crazy when you think about it that way.\" This prompted Jensen to start going over Nvidia's beginning, when it was a tiny group of engineers in 1993: \"We were trying to create this new computing approach.

    "body": "This multiplayer, base-building, sea-battling survival crafter (previously known as Crosswind) has a new trailer that just aired during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. Windrose is chock full of swashbuckling combat and intrepid exploration that'll leave pirate fans staring out toward the horizon with a wanderlust most palpable. Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Windrose now on Steam Previous trailers showed off the character creation menus, along with some combat, building, and farming, but this is a more distilled look at the kind of combat we can expect in game. It begins as we make off from our shuttered island sanctuary, complete with a grandfather clock, brimming bookshelf, and gorgeous marble planters decorating the terrace. My eyes are on the writing desk by the window that's buried beneath a mass of what I can only assume to be tasty, tasty treasure maps. Moving toward a small armada docked at the quay, we zoom in for a quick closeup shot of a tricorn-wearing player character, hands caked in tattoos and eyebrows out to the brim of his hat. The remainder is a montage of quick bouts of melee and ranged combat, all expertly cut to an epic, vibrant guitar riff that really capt…",

If you're over here wondering what to expect from a game about a baby riding the back of a big ol' demon pal, I can confirm it's just the kind of weirdness you'd expect. Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Damon and Baby on Steam First shown off at the Arc System Works showcase in the summer, the game already has a full trailer, but this new one boils it down to its core elements: top-down shooting, wall-running, and dual-wielding firepower It's got some weird lookin' characters to show off, too. We're talking horned, wide-eyed, red-faced demons with bright orange tentacles for arms… Of course no anime-esque game would be complete without a suited and booted wolf man, and a pair of battle-ready bunny girls. Just as the game tells the tale of a fusion of unlikely personalities, so too is it a fusion of genres. From twin-stick shooting to in-depth exploration-based action adventure, it looks like a super varied experience that includes puzzle solving, character upgrades, and outfit customization elements. Yeah, you can make Damon look dapp…",
