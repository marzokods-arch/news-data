This might be a conscious effort on my part, because other than becoming infatuated with Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, I actually didn't sink much time at all into finding my next farming obsession. So if you want to do the same, here are my favorite cozy games from 2025.

I've always liked the idea of a charging dock conceptually, but I've never quite committed to getting a bit of gaming gear with one for a specific reason: I'm a bit lazy. I was worried I'd pay a premium for a bit of hardware, and then forget to charge it, so end up leaving it plugged in anyway, thus removing the whole point of getting it in the first place. Well, I and all my hubris didn't account for two ways that 8BitDo's Retro R8 would counter those points. First is that its retail price is $50 (with it going as low as $35 already). The second is that it looks so good, I can't help but put it on its well-earned throne. See, the Retro R8 I reviewed earlier this year comes in an NES-style theming, with a smattering of whites, greys, reds, and blacks. It looks incredible next to my 8BitDo Retro keyboard . The stand itself plugs into the PC via a USB Type-C cable, and you can pop a dongle from the bottom of the mouse into the stand.

It utterly swept the Game Awards, becoming the highest winner in the show's 11-year history and being the first studio debut to nab the coveted Game of the Year award. We love to look back on years by the games that defined them: 2023 was very much The Year of Baldur's Gate, and Elden Ring was the videogame mascot of 2022. But honestly? It doesn't feel quite right doing that this year. 2025 has been home to a dizzying array of incredibly cool, and interesting concepts nailed by development studios of all sizes. And I kind of love that, at least for me, I can't pinpoint a single game that has represented my entire year. (Image credit: Sandfall Interactive) Clair Obscur is not excluded from this praise—its homage to JRPGs of the late '90s with Sandfall's French twist is well-deserving of its success—but I don't remember the last time I was able to dive into so many new games that were, well, different. Stuff I had just not seen before, or refined concepts that were able to breathe new life into existing spaces. Blue Prince is a game that received zero awards at Geoff Keighley's trailer bonanza—it lost …",

    "body": "كشفت تقارير صحفية عن خطة نادي تشيلسي للميركاتو الشتوي المقرر بداية من شهر يناير/كانون الثاني المقبل. ووفقا لشبكة سكاي سبورتس لا يتطلع فريق المدرب إنزو ماريسا لإبرام صفقات كبيرة خلال فترة الانتقالات الشتوية، حيث يركز بشكل أساسي على نوافذ الصيف في عامي 2026 و2027 لتعزيز الفريق. وستكون الأولوية في الشهر المقبل على تفريغ الفريق من اللاعبين المهمشين الذين فشل النادي في بيعهم خلال الصيف الماضي. يبرز من بين هؤلاء رحيم ستيرلينج وأكسيل ديساسي وتيريك جورج، الذين كانوا جميعا متاحين للرحيل في الصيف، وقد يجدون وجهات جديدة هذه المرة. ويبقى ستيرلينج اللاعب الوحيد المتبقي فيما يعرف بـ \"الفرقة المنبوذة\" بعد عودة ديساسي إلى تدريبات الفريق الأول في نوفمبر الماضي. ومع ذلك، يبدو إيجاد نار جديد للجناح الإنجليزي أمرا معقدا، نظراً لرغبته في البقاء في لندن من أجل عائلته، إلى جانب راتبه المرتفع الذي يشكل العائق الأكبر. ورغم عودة ديساسي إلى التدريبات، إلا أن رحيله في يناير يظل احتمالا قويا، خاصة أن أندية مثل سندرلاند وبورنموث ووست هام یونایتد أبدت اهتماما به خلال الصيف، كما عُرض على كريستال بالاس. ويتوقع تشيلسي أن يجذب المدافع الفرنسي مزيدا من العروض في السوق الشتوية. أما الشاب تيريك جورج، فقد أثار إعجاب مسؤولي تشيلسي بأدائه هذا الموسم، لكنه يسعى للحصول على وقت لعب منتظم. المنافسة الشديدة في مراكز الهجوم تح…",

In many ways, it's a great game—a throwback to the arcade beat-'em-up era that proves how fun and satisfying that classic formula can still be. But at the same time, it feels like that devotion to nostalgia holds it back, with a short campaign and few incentives to replay. I thought it was going to be the defining beat-'em-up of the year, but the more I played it, the more I found my mind drifting back to a different game I'd played only a month before: Absolum .

Gaming microphones have come on in leaps and bounds over the past few years, putting great vocal capture in the hands of anyone with a USB connection and a small slab of cash to spend. However, 2025 has seen the rise of several reasonably-priced contenders that can swim remarkably close to the pricier players for minimal expense, and that's the sort of development I can really get behind. Each of the three microphones below is very well-priced for what it delivers, and also happens to be one of the best mics we've tested all year. All that's left now is to give one of our contenders the best microphone of 2025 award, so we'd better round up our nominations into one big capsule-shaped basket, hadn't we? If you're looking for the cheapest of the cheap, look no further than the Amazon Basics USB Condenser Microphone .

We put every headset we review through the ringer, judging it not just on audio quality, but on comfort, build quality, connection options, and much, much more. So when it comes to picking just three, it's been something of a tough call. Still, first and foremost has to be the Fractal Design Scape , a headset with a clever magnetic wireless charging system that's been something of a game changer for me, and takes pride of place on my desk. Ah, if only the Scape had its own way. Extremely tough competition, though, comes in the form of the Razer BlackShark V3 , an updated model that managed to knock the long-reigning HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless from its top cable-free spot in our best gaming headset guide when we reviewed it earlier this year.

In more recent years I've gone spelunking in places like iTunes, but inconsistent regional availability, seemingly random tags that omit or misspell an artist's name or list soundtracks under a generic publisher label can make game music frustratingly hard to find. Thankfully, things are getting better—and especially on Steam. I can buy and listen to standalone soundtracks in a click or two.

I thought I couldn't really be surprised by a new model, but the Fractal Design Scape changed all that for me in 2025. It's got the same recipe, sure. But in terms of the experience it delivers, it feels like Fractal Design has taken all the things I love about a really good set of gaming cans and elevated them to new heights. I'm convinced it's the way all wireless gaming headsets should be from this point onwards, and that makes it the best thing I've personally tested all year. The Scape is a lesson in refinement. For a start, it's got a grown-up chassis design. No garish colour schemes here, just a flat black, matte finish with some subtle, recessed RGB lighting.

The now-ubiquitous portmanteau we use to describe the genre is, in itself, a reference to it being fertile ground for cross-pollinating ideas. Metroid's exploration dovetailed nicely with Castlevania's gothic stylings and Symphony Of The Night's surprisingly in-depth RPG elements, which Hollow Knight dials down the in favour of death mechanics and boss runbacks from Dark Souls.

We've not only seen some fantastic iterations on already-great designs—hello Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro —but also some genuinely new and interesting leaps forward. The other two nominees for the best gaming mouse of 2025 epitomise this, with one being a big leap forward in light mouse weight, and the other being a big leap in customisability. In addition to these, though, 2025 has given us a bunch of great new mice in pretty much every niche. Want an MMO mouse? Great, you have the Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE . Want an ergonomic mouse? You have the Keychron M5 . Want something very cheap but high quality? No problem, you have the Glorious Model O Eternal . There's even been something for those of you looking for a nostalgia hit in the form of the 8BitDo Retro R8 . All those are genuinely fantastic mice, too. Which means narrowing down all of these to just three nominees for the best gaming mouse of 2025 was a little difficult. But I reckon this is it; the three gaming mice below are the best we've se…",

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . I like shooting dudes—or stabbing them, setting them on fire, blowing them up, running them over with tracked vehicles, clubbing them to death with a hammer, whatever the latest game in my library calls for—as much as the next guy. It's fun! It also sometimes feels very limiting: I wonder, as I put three in the back of some digital rando's head for the thousandth time, is this all there is? Herdling was my antidote to all the digital bloodletting of 2025. It's a light puzzle adventure game about life and hope, dreams and magic, where violence exists solely as something to be avoided. Any fool can kill, and as Herdling begins, those fools have done a great job of it: The world lies dying, a victim of neglectful indifference and selfishiness, and no one seems to care, or even notice. But there is still magic to be found, if you know where to look amidst dirty underpasses and greasy parking lots—or if you'r…",

Thankfully, 2025 has really solidified the fact that we can somehow have our cake and eat it these days. Gaming keyboards left and right have started to offer a ton of gaming features and really great typing feel and build quality. The topper is that many of the fantastic keyboards we're seeing popping up—the Gamakay x NaughShark NS68 on this list, the NuPhy Air60 HE , or the Lofree Flow 2 , to name a few—are priced very well for what you're getting. That's especially surprising for overtly gaming-oriented keyboards like the NaughShark, given that historically you'd often have to essentially pay a gamer tax for extra features and build quality. There are almost too many keyboards to choose from this year, but we've managed to narrow it down to just three nominees for t…",

Remarkably, it's not even close. Its previous peak is from when it released into early access in 2018, at just over 33,000 players, and this holiday season has brought it screaming past 57,000 a few hours before I wrote this article (it's settled down to about 35,000 now—still a notch above the old record). The game has been good the whole time, but there are a few probable causes for this sudden surge in spire slaying. As SteamDB notes , the 2025 winter sale brought Slay the Spire to a historic low of $2.49; while the site only records sale history two years back, I don't recall it ever being quite this cheap. As everyone rushes to burn their Steam wallets on the best deals, such an acclaimed game for the price of a pack of gum is a no-brainer.

And yet there are several unambiguous signs that the Arm revolution on the PC may well be imminent. Yes, for real this time. What's more, modern Arm CPUs look very compelling on paper. When it comes to single-core performance, all the indications are that they are actually superior to x86. And single-core performance is particularly important for gaming. Anyway, if the Snapdragon X has been a disappointment, that's perhaps as much down to unrealistic expectations as it is any failings of Snapdragon X or Arm CPUs more generally. In other words, if Arm is to take a big chunk of the PC market, or even overtake x86, that is never going to happen overnight.

PC Gamer's Lauren Morton wrote up impressions on the game back in 2023 and called it \"a pretty sick Pokémon remix,\" shouting out its nonstandard element types like plastic, glass, and glitter. Instead of taming wild animals, you transform into monsters you've \"recorded\" to cassette tapes. There's also the fusion system, where any two monster forms can be mixed and matched to get new ones complete with original pixel art and a mashed-up name. It's the sort of imagination kickstarter that should please fans of JRPG tactics and cozy gamers just here for the cool dudes alike. Even without all that, the addition of online co-op gives it a firm leg up over the genre's biggest entrants, and the musical aesthe…",

It's a change that's been percolating for a while, but 2025 was the year a number of developing trends in PC gaming's favorite genre finally boiled over. The time of extreme skill ceilings and the pursuit of metallic ranks defining every new multiplayer FPS is behind us. The escalation of gaudy, overpriced cosmetics created a distaste so palpable that Call of Duty had to desperately change its game plan. The two biggest shooters this year cost money, and there were no major free-to-play releases. The theme of this new era, as I see it developing so far, is remembering that shooters can be both casual and thrilling. High fun, low emotional investment. An old guard of life-consuming live-service games remains a vibrant and popular part of this genre, but they're once again sharing the space with—and even adopting the attributes of—a more casual breed. Games that don't mind if you only play them once in a while. Games that let you make your own fun, encourage cooperation, or earn our respect by not bombarding us with ads.

This year didn't leave me with a lack of things to talk about, either. If anything, it was almost too busy for even the most enthusiastic of survival crafting sickos. I spent months bouncing between my sandstorm-battered home in Dune: Awakening, then bug-infested dwellings in Grounded 2, and cobbled-together cubicles of Abiotic Factor. It's just, well, I really love the thrill of collecting giant piles of junk. Then there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of taking all that junk and turning it into things. And if you give me a monotonous little chore to do on the side? That's just icing on the cake. It's an unfortunate way to be when most games checking those boxes have no clear end, though it does explain why I've got a growing list of survival crafting playgrounds I'm taking with me into 2026.

Some of them I've bought myself, others have been kindly provided by hardware companies (and let me take this opportunity to directly thank MSI, Asus, and Corsair on that note).

Even the products that didn't get a high review score still had some feature to make them stand out a bit from the crowd, or offered something special for the right user.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. For all its efforts to streamline the extraction shooter genre and make a game that anyone can pick up and play even a year down the line, Arc Raiders has some hidden complexities. Since launch, we've been pushing the game to its limits and have already discovered a number of odd quirks. While some make sense if you really think about it, most of them you'd never have guessed. Whether it's cheeky movement tech that'll give you a leg up Topside, skills not quite functioning how they should (or just being very weak), or the confusing way friendly fire works, it's all useful information to have stored in your brain. But not every tip you hear from other players is true. Below, I've picked a handful of Arc Raiders myths, and you'll have to figure out which ones are true and which are false. And if you guess wrong, you'll learn some surprisingly handy facts that'll keep you breathing next time you go to the surface, so it's a win-win.",

Admittedly, most of them weren't much of a surprise, as the Ryzen 9 9950X3D was expected right from the launch of Zen 5.

AMD announced them at CES , and we didn't have to wait too long before we saw mighty APUs in use in the Framework Desktop and even in some handhelds . The real surprise was the Ryzen 5 7500X3D .

Even though there has been a strong trend of co-op games in the past few years, Aggro Crab and Landfall weren't expecting Peak to explode in popularity. \"When we flew to Sweden to release the game with the Landfall team, we were ready to hit the launch button and go into vacation mode,\" Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman told GamesRadar . \"That quickly became a pipe dream.\" Everyone immediately fell in love with the game about elastic little guys waddling up mountains together and the developers quickly pivoted to supporting it with bug fixes, new items, and new maps. And now, six months later, the game is still thriving. Earlier this month, Peak had an in-game concert by rapper bbno$ like it was Fortnite.

I'm not sure why, but it's probably due to how Anglo-American entertainment media has programmed my brain to perceive heroic archetypes as tall, dark and handsome. So finding out that all FromSoft's dodge-rolling warriors are the same height as me was surprising, leading me to think more deeply about how we represent height in games. Some of this manifested in bizarre tangents, like when I bugged Arkane Studios level designer and The Black Parade director Romain Barrilliot to help me figure out the height of Garrett from Thief. Interestingly, it turns out that Garrett's height varies across the games. He's exactly six feet tall in Thief: The Dark Project , slightly taller in Thief 2: The Metal Age (though this extra couple of inches may be pur…",

But 2025 isn't over just yet so, while I've got the breathing room, I'm gonna fill my lungs and shout about the SSDs that impressed us the most this year. Unlike last year , no teeny-tiny 2230 form factor drives get a look in this year. Obviously, handheld gaming PCs are no less popular, but internal NVMe SSDs have simply had a stronger showing this year. However, that doesn't mean this is anything like a one horse race—even our best SSD for gaming has a veritable stable full of anime horse girls . Confusing metaphors? Me? Never. Anyway, keeping things interesting, it's not just one brand dominating the nominee top spots. In fact, each of our nominees differ in terms of capacity and even form factor—we've even got an external SSD this year in the form of the exceptional Sandisk Extreme Pro .

It takes a lot for a farming simulator to really impress me these days—I'm sure most avid cozy gamers will sympathise with me when I say that. Stardew Valley has had a lasting impact on me, let alone the cozy gaming space in general, and finding something that really lives up to the excitement of venturing into Pelican Town for the first time is becoming more and more challenging.

This year has been a bit of a weird one for gaming handhelds. AMD's mighty Strix Halo chip launched at CES, yet it's too power hungry and hot to see its inclusion in anything we can actually use right now. AMD's Z Extreme range is still going strong, though, with the Z1 Extreme making for a good mid-range handheld, and the new Z2 Extreme powering the surprisingly capable Asus ROG Xbox Ally X . The Xbox Ally X had to do an awful lot to justify the very premium price point, but smart software, a comfortable fit, and excellent performance make it a standout choice for the 1% of the gaming world. Despite its latest range of desktop chips being a bit of a letdown, Intel managed to put out some fierce mobile chips, too. The Core Ultra 7 258V powering the MSI Claw 8 AI+ seems to be one of the standouts, giving excellent performance. However, the chip isn't the only thing that makes a device, and our favourite gaming handhelds of this year pack a punch in the look, feel, and battery life departments.

I switched to it myself earlier this year, but I'm back on Windows and I don't think I'll be switching back to Linux properly any time soon. The Linux hype this time was precipitated by Valve's Linux-based operating system, SteamOS, opening up for use on other handhelds than just the Steam Deck . That had been long on the cards , but it finally started seeming close at hand early on this year. SteamOS has shown what Linux can be capable of for gaming in large part because of Proton , the compatibility layer Valve employs to translate Windows commands into ones that Linux can understand. It's a fork of WINE tailored towards gaming, created and maintained by Valve specifically for that purpose. Over the years, Proton has gotten so good that compatible games tend to run flawlessly. Valve has an incentive to ensure this is the case, as a great gaming experience on SteamOS via Proton makes for more Steam Deck and Steam Store sales. The development and improvement of …",
