    "body": "حكم الكلاسيكو يفتح باب الجدل تسبب حكم مباراة النصر والاتحاد التي جمعت الطرفين، مساء الجمعة، ضمن الجولة 21 من دوري روشن، حالة من الجدل والغضب داخل أروقة \"العميد\". وخسر الاتحاد خارج أرضه أمام النصر، بهدفين دون رد، ليتجمد رصيده عند 34 نقطة، متراجعًا للمرتبة السابعة في جدول ترتيب المسابقة. اللقطة الأبرز تعود للدقيقة 12 من الشوط الأول، عندما ارتطمت الكرة في يد الفرنسي محمد سيماكان، مدافع النصر، ولكن الحكم تغاضى عن احتساب ركلة جزاء. وعن هذا الأمر، قال حمد المنتشري، مدافع الاتحاد السابق، في تصريحات عبر برنامج \"دورينا غير\" السعودي: \"الفريق يعاني فنيًا بشكل واضح، فالمدرب لم يقم بالتحضير جيدًا لمواجهة النصر\". وأضاف: \"الاتحاد خسر لعدة أسباب، يأتي على رأسها قرارات الحكم الغربية، بالإضافة لسوء إدارة كونسيساو للمباراة، فهو كان يلعب بفكرة واحدة فقط، وهي الهجوم عبر الجناحين فقط\". وتابع حديثه: \"جيسوس احترم الاتحاد ولعب بأفكار جيدة، وبالتالي نجح في التفوق على كونسيساو، الذي لم يبتكر أي شيء\". وعن قرارات الحكم، قال: \"جميع البشر في الكرة الأرضية يتفقون على أحقية الاتحاد في الحصول على ركلة جزاء، إلا الحكم فقد اتخذ قرارًا غريبًا، رغم أنه عاد لمشاهدة اللقطة\". واختتم: \"ما أحزنني هو عودة الاتحاد لتقنية الفيديو، وعاد لعدم احتسابها، فهو كان سببًا في الخسارة\".",
