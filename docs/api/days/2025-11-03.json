Confronted with the bloat of today's Windows install, I do wish certain software peddlers had committed to a similar philosophy of 'less is more.' Pleasingly then, one tech tinkerer has pushed Windows 7 to its Lilliputian limits. X user @XenoPanther shared a 69 MB version of Windows 7 x86 that just about boots (via The Register ). Created more just to see if they could rather than as an actually usable OS, @XenoPanther writes , \"Virtually nothing can run due to critical missing files such as common dialog boxes and common controls.\" The punchline, though? The Windows anti-infringement system still works , helpfully declaring that this copy of the OS is not in fact genuine. If you want to noodle around with the outrageously small OS yourself, @XenoPanther has uploaded the file list to Archive.org . It's only the latest in a long line of unofficial attempts to shrink Windows. Last year, we saw another software tinkerer shrink Windows 11 down to only 100 MB by making it throwback to its DOS era.

Once you know where to look, though, it's not too much work. You don't even need to walk very far between each step, nor do you need to bring any specific items in or out—that's why I recommend bringing a free loadout . Below, I'll go over how to complete With a Trace so you're not as lost as I was. How to complete With a Trace in Arc Raiders Your first task is to reach Barren Clearing, which is basically an Arc graveyard on the western edge of Blue Gate. The issue here is that this quest step automatically progresses from a surprising distance away—I was in Adorned Wreckage, so I wasted time searching here first.

The latter debuted to mixed Steam reviews and muted sales when it carved its way into early access back in January, resulting in layoffs at Heart Machine and work on Hyper Light Breaker ceasing prematurely . But it seems this wasn't enough to right Heart Machine's ailing vessel, as the studio began a second round of layoffs late last week. This time the cuts were focussed on the team creating the side-scrolling action/adventure Possessor(s), occurring less than a fortnight before the game is due to launch. The combined layoffs have led some players to question whether to continue supporting Heart Machine financially. In a Steam discussion , user Adam posted that it's \"hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game.\" This was apparently posted in response to the initial round of layoffs, but other users began to debate whether developers who'd had their jobs working on Possessor(s) cut would see a return for their efforts. \"I have no intention of giving money to a company that thanked them for that work by kickin…",

During this quest, Shani asks you to take the LiDAR Scanners you previously recovered at the Spaceport and place three of them at the highest points in different regions, letting her spy on what Arc is up to. You'll have to ascend to three of the tallest points in Dam Battlegrounds, Spaceport, and Buried City, and while one of these is very simple, the other two require a bit more work, including using a zipline gadget for the final one. Here's how to complete Eyes in the Sky. On Dam Battlegrounds, install a LiDAR Scanner on top of the Control Tower Image 1 of 2 Climb to the top of the Control Tower using the liftshaft you can breach open (Image credit: Embark Studios) Image 2 of 2 Place the scanner at the prompted tripod on the east corner of the roof (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first LiDAR Scanner you have to place is at the top of the Control Tower, just south of the centre of Dam Battlegrounds.

Which sounds like it'd be pretty tough, given his story is pretty well wrapped-up in 2077 and his actual mortal body has already been dead for decades by that game's start. Or so you might think. But that, and no other reason, is why you aren't Cyberpunk TTRPG creator Mike Pondsmith. In a recent stream (via GamesRadar ), Pondsmith sounded just as eager as Reeves to get the Hollywood star back into Silverhand's big boots. \"You know, not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again,\" said Pondsmith. \"I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me.\" What ways? Well, canny old Pondsmith doesn't say. I don't think it's hard to figure out a few plausible theories, though.

    "body": "Fine, I'll say it. The Tropics has always been my least favourite biome in Peak . I hate the exploding mushrooms that always send me hurtling off the mountain, and the fact that everything can and will poison you. Not to mention the ticks. Luckily, a new biome is rolling out this week on November 5, which will be an alternative for the Tropics, though I'm not particularly thrilled about what might be lurking there either. In a trailer posted to the Aggro Crab and Landfall YouTube Channels, the Roots biome has been revealed. Though saying that, we aren't given a particularly in-depth look at what exactly that means in terms of climbing. Given that the two Scouts in the trailer are seen amongst a cluster of redwood trees, we can only assume that this biome will involve a lot of swinging between vines to reach the safety of platforms and Shelf Shrooms tucked between branches. However, one element that the trailer does hint towards is the addition of spiders. If they act in-game exactly as they do in the trailer, then these horrible critters will spring down from the top of trees and pick up Scouts. What happens from there is currently a mystery, but I don't doubt it'll end in your bo…",

Street Racing Syndicate arrived on PC a year later, and while it was no Need For Speed Underground or Burnout 2: Point of Impact, it found fans among those who enjoyed customizing its roster of licensed cares, free-roaming its Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Miami maps, and outrunning the police. What players didn't like was a bug specific to the PC version that made the sun blindingly bright on daylight tracks. \"HOW TO REMOVE THE SUN? LOL\" asks one poster on the Steam forum, while another laments, \"I guess the developers never heard of windshield visors or sunglasses.\" Wait long enough, and eventually a hero will come along—in this case a modder by the name of Radzerg, who just released a patch with the simple declaration, \"I've fixed the sun\".

You can blame it on the bushes that failed to hide your position against players who have found out that your graphics settings can be a slight competitive advantage. It wasn't that you were crouched in the middle of nowhere with absolutely zero cover. Definitely not. If you play enough competitive shooters, you'll learn pretty quickly about the tricks graphics settings can play on you. Arc Raiders is the newest shooter with a foliage problem and you might not realize it's holding you back—especially if you're a sweaty PvPer. Knee-high bushes and other shrubbery can be toggled on or off through the foliage graphics setting, and you probably want it on \"low\". YouTuber staycation provides a good example of the difference with some bushes around a car. With the \"epic\" setting, the bushes obscure some of the ground around the edges of the car, which could make it hard to see someone at a distance. The lowest setting gets rid of them entirely, giving you a clean view to line up a shot or catch someone hiding. Notably, the foliage setting doesn't seem to affect the bi…",

Now, at last, the ultimate reward: an all-out fight against one final boss complete with an epic song that usually encapsulates your hours of hard work and your character's growth into some freakishly powerful being. For me, most of my exposure to boss themes growing up came through the endless stream of JRPGs I played. Final Fantasy 7's One Winged Angel will be the one that springs to mind for a lot of people, but I'm an absolute sucker for Final Fantasy 6's Dancing Mad—a whopping 18-minute, four-movement symphony that plays when facing off against Kefka Palazzo.

Alright, let me roll up my sleeves and deliver unto you some lore . Not just any lore: mod lore . Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently. World of Warcraft has historically embraced AddOn creators with open arms, giving a ton of the game's information to them in-client through its API. Crack open the shell of any WoW raider's client and you'll find a homebrew moonshine concoction of custom raid frames, sound effects, and WeakAuras telling them what buttons to push and when.

Well, there are three egg-themed games launching within a week of each other. Which isn't that many in the grand Steam of things, but in my book it still qualifies as an eggstrava—no, spare them the egg puns, Rick. Nobody deserves that. Two of these games are similar to the point where they could've been laid by the same hen. The other looks like it sluiced from the cloaca of some shrieking nightmare chicken that escaped from Cthulhu's battery farm. Anyway, let's cra- uh, move on, starting with the simplest. Egg (subtitled 'Why not be an egg'?) is the new game from VVVVVV and Super Hexagon creator Terry Cavanagh. Available on Itch, it's a lo-fi, 3D puzzle platformer where you must guide a box of half-a-dozen eggs across a vertiginous, grassy cliffside searching for a lovely nest to, well, nestle in. The eggs navigate across the landscape by jumping. The longer you hold down the spacebar, the farther your chosen ovum will jump. If an egg falls off a platform, it breaks,…",

Yet having watched the most recent trailer for the game, which accompanied an announcement for Legacy of Shadow's release date, I wonder whether I was a bit too quick to judge. The trailer shows new protagonist Magpie breaking into a house in New Quarter to retrieve a valuable mask. The moment-to-moment play looks more promising than the brief snippets shown in the original trailer.

The cooperative shooter proved a disappointment when it released in June, launching in an anaemic state, lacking basic features like in-game voice chat and a tutorial, and generally seeming like a compromised vision despite a few novel ideas. Its first major update, Breakpoint, went some way to addressing these issues , but failed to provide the bump in players Remedy hoped for. Indeed, at the time of writing, just 25 people were playing FBC: Firebreak according to SteamDB . The actual count is likely higher given Firebreak's availability on consoles and Game Pass, but probably not by much. In early October, Remedy issued a profit warning for 2025 due to Firebreak's underperformance. Less than two weeks later, Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, stepped down with immediate effect. Now, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz , Remedy has issued its financial results for Q3 2025, posting a 32% decline in revenue versus Q3 2024, and an operating loss of €16.4 million. Unsurprisingly, Firebreak is the chief culprit, with Remedy recognising a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million due to the shooter's poor performance. Speaking in the report, …",

Vampires to their coffins, zombies to their graves, and humans as far away from here as they can get. The trick is that your tracks can't pass over each other, there's only room for one passenger per car, and there are fixed entrances and exits to each tiny area. The land of \"Trainsylvania\" has over 200 levels for you to figure out, with exactly the kind of thoughtful design you'd expect from Draknek. Which is to say that each area starts off fairly simple, with levels introducing new concepts and ways to use puzzle elements before delivering excellent brain-burning problems to solve with just the same materials you'd found so easily a few levels before.

Skinballs was made up of four spheres, each textured in a different flesh tone and used by artists to ensure scenes were properly lit for characters of all potential skin colors. Borman, the director of digital preservation at the Strong, expressed his own appreciation for Skinballs , and noted that it's become a bit of a memetic delight in various mod communities, sort of like that purple checkerboard missing texture pattern you see in Source engine games.

The scale makes sense for its intended purpose, and it even has fun-size versions of distinct map features like the high path on one side of the canyon, and the protected cave route on the other. The bases themselves are small fortifications with a jump pad in the center, and usually see weapon and ammo spawns depending on what wave you've reached. It's frantic, claustrophobic, and fun. Plus, it had been a minute since I'd actually loaded up Dusk at all, and I'd forgotten just how good it is. Dusk has proudly joined its inspirations, Half-Life and Quake, in the ranks of …",

These include several natural phenomena like aquifers and geothermal fields, which you can exploit with discoverable tech like geothermal engines and aquifer drills. Other objects being introduced are more hazardous, like brambles that can harm your beavers when they try to clear them, and unstable cores that might explode should your beavers approach too closely.

But Rockstar's original schoolyard simulator is about to receive a new lease of life.

Normally generative AI use is a huge no from me, but PP's systems are built in-house, created using publicly available data and used only to generate the game's hyper-realistic terrain, which is then supplemented by more traditional procgen systems and 3D art.

The biggest multiplayer shooters of the moment cost money. Arc Raiders is $40, has no free trial, and it's a top seller. Battlefield 6 launched for $70 and instantly became the most successful game in the series (later adding a free-to-play battle royale mode). Both are raking it in, both are reviewing well, and both are being played more than several of the sturdiest free-to-play shooters on Steam. The numbers won't always look like that, but the wild successes of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders prove an important point: people want to pay for great multiplayer shooters again. That's music to my ears, because it didn't always look like we'd get back to this point. Not long ago, it wasn't unreasonable to believe the future of all multiplayer gaming was free-to-play.

The Novablade Pro Wireless has Hall effect magnetic switches, which not only ensure a longer shelf life but also allow custom actuation on the board.

Corsair says switches can be hit up to 150 million times, which is approximately three games for the average button basher. Speaking of button bashers, this fight controller has rapid trigger keys, which means they stop pressing the second you do. A more traditional switch starts and stops pressing at a certain actuation, which means you are losing milliseconds with each hit. That allows you to not only hit keys quicker, but also more often.

    "body": "The first-person feudal Japan horror game Labyrinth of the Demon King knocked my socks off when it released back in May, and it's only gotten better since launch and PCG Australian editor Shaun Prescott's 81% review . The game's latest update adds a hefty-sounding new game plus mode , while it's also on sale for 25% off to celebrate Halloween until November 3. I'm a sucker for replaying the games I love, but I often find NG+ modes can leave me feeling cold. I always want new story beats or remixed levels, like Dark Souls 2's devious black phantom mixups and upgraded bosses, but so often a NG+ run can feel flat, with retained gear and levels just trivializing the experience and removing any feeling of progression or reward. Labyrinth of the Demon King sounds like it's doing things right, tempting me to jump back into my second playthrough (where I learned from my mistakes and unlocked the game's best katana ) and punch through to the new stuff. The Steam page for the update promises \"new weapons, new enemies, new upgraded enemies, a new NG+ mechanic ( don't want to spoil it⁠—experience it for yourself! ) new NPC interactions & peeks into the world's lore, and a new… boss ?\" The new…",

There's actually a way to craft these materials rather than having to head Topside and run the gauntlet of robots and loot-hungry humans. You'll need Mechanical Components to upgrade your Gunsmith to level two, which is something you'll want to get done ASAP, considering your weaponry is the only thing keeping you alive against Arc Raiders' array of hostile drones of all shapes and sizes. So, here's how to get this crafting material for yourself. How to get Mechanical Components in Arc Raiders You can craft Mechanical Components in the Refinery for basic materials (Image credit: Embark Studios) There are two main ways to get Mechanical Components in Arc Raiders, the first being to build the Refiner in your workshop, which lets you craft them for: 7x Metal Parts 3x Rubber Parts Both of these are extremely common materials that you'll find just about everywhere in Arc Raiders, or you can get them by recycling many scrap items you pick up.

    "body": "Jacob Fox, hardware writer (Image credit: Future) This week: I've been, believe it or not, testing some new lightweight gaming mice. I've been pretty exclusively using lightweight wireless gaming mice for the last few years, so I'm always surprised by how many people are still sceptical. Over the years, I've seen the scepticism from comments on my articles and reviews, various online discussion boards, and even friends and colleagues. So I'm here to defend what is, in my perhaps not-so-humble opinion, one of the best upgrades you can make if you're into shooters, which is using a lightweight wireless gaming mouse. I know a lot of gamers will read this and think duh , but this isn't for them; it's for those who are still clinging on to the familiar, like I was for so long. And such people do exist: I've seen them. Plenty of people won't give a lightweight mouse a real go, and some still won't try out wireless. Switching to a lightweight wireless gaming mouse has probably given me the biggest upgrade to my gaming experience I've had since I jumped from a 60 Hz to a 144 Hz monitor back in the day. It took me a long time to come around to it, as I tend to stick with what I'm used to, …",
