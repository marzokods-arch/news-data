Maggie Antone, &#8220;The Devil&#8217;s Not In Hell&#8221; Maggie Antone follows her 2024 album Rhinestoned with this venom-filled takedown, as she delivers a character assassination of a self-centered man who thinks he everyone&#8217;s dream. &#8220;Meet one, you swear you&#8217;ve met &#8217;em all,&#8221; Antone sings, her vocals filled with vigor and spitfire, as she calls out the guy&#8217;s womanizing ways, before adding, &#8220;All his exes are crazy/ It&#8217;s not his fault (it&#8217;s never his fault),&#8221; and exposing the narcissist&#8217;s pitfalls.

Apple TV is becoming a popular streaming service outside of the Apple ecosystem, with viral hits like Severance, Pluribus, and Ted Lasso. The streaming platform finally earned its own Android app in February, allowing Android users to subscribe to Apple TV or the MLS Season Pass on their smartphone via Google Play Billing. While the Android app supported many of the same features as its iOS counterpart, it was missing one thing: Google Cast support. Now, that’s changing, with version 2.2 of the Apple TV app for Android adding Google Cast support. It’s rolling out now on the Google Play Store , making it easy for users to cast Apple TV shows to their favorite smart TVs and displays.

Morgan Wallen continued his domination on both the country and pop charts, while Lainey Wilson, Megan Moroney, Ella Langley , Russell Dickerson and Riley Green all reached new levels of success. In addition to Moroney and Langley, there was a new class of artists all of whom experienced their first major flushes of success, including Zach Top, Tucker Wetmore, Carter Faith, Josh Ross, John Morgan and Chase Matthew. Top ushered in a growing neo-traditionalist movement that also includes artists like Jake Worthington and Braxton Keith. With all of the above artists releasing new music, it was a rich and varied musical year. On Billboard ’s Country Airplay chart, Wallen reigned, taking four different songs to the pinnacle in 2025, including “I’m the Problem,” which tied Jelly Roll’s “Liar” for the longest run at the top at five consecutive weeks. Fun fact: in 2025, Hootie &amp; The Blowfish logged their first No. 1 on the Country Airplay chart for their appearance on Scotty McCreery’s “Bottle Rockets,” which features the Darius Rucker-led group singing their 1994 hit, “Hold My Hand.” In comparison, 21 songs hit No. 1 on the Count…",

Just a mere 4% of all Hot 100 No. 1s dating to the chart’s launch on Aug. 4, 1958, have earned the achievement. Olivia Newton-John’s “Physical” flexed 10 weeks at No. 1 in 1981-82, and that smash and Boone’s shared the mark for the longest Hot 100 reign for more than a decade, until Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road” dominated for 13 weeks in 1992. That best lasted briefly, as Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” led for 14 weeks in late 1992/early 1993. In 1995-96, Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men’s “One Sweet Day” ran up 16 weeks at No. 1, a milestone that held for more than 23 years. (Songs began logging longer No. 1 stays after the Hot 100 adopted electronically tracked data, according to Luminate, in late 1991.) In 2017, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito,” featuring Justin Bieber, tied the No. 1 run of “One Sweet Day.” By 2019, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, collected 19 weeks atop the Hot 100, a mark matched by Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” beginning in July 2024.

The experiment sees users make plain-language requests about the type of content they want to see. You can sign up for the latest experiment in Search Labs now. Google gives the option to try a bunch of developing search-related features early in Search Labs. This weekend, a Reddit user spotted a new Labs feature that purportedly lets you tweak the content on your Discover feed to your liking — using AI, of course. User Gaiden206 posted screenshots of the new experiment on the r/pixel_phones subreddit. Called “Tailor your feed,” the experiment lets you tell the Google app specifically the type of content you do or don’t want to see in Discover, with flexibility to add or remove topics, or narrow the focus of a type of content you’re already seeing. You can even use it to have Discover pick up or exclude content from specific sources.",

The UI doesn’t clearly explain what the button is supposed to do. Google really wants people to try its AI Mode, which turns searching for information on the web into a quasi-conversation with a multimodal chatbot. Just last week, we saw that Chrome is getting ready to incorporate AI Mode right into the browser , and now, a new icon that surfaces some AI Mode functionality is showing up on the Google homepage. The search bar at google.com has included an AI Mode icon on the right hand side for some time. Today, we’re seeing an additional plus icon at the left side of the bar. Clicking the plus brings up options to upload an image or document, either of which will initiate an AI Mode interaction where you can ask questions about your upload.",

Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average. Wi-Fi still prevailed at a few locations, but most airports haven’t yet adopted the more recent Wi-Fi standards. As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

Some researchers estimate that there are as many as two trillion galaxies in the observable universe. At first glance, these galaxies might appear to be randomly scattered across space, but they’re not. Careful mapping has shown that they are distributed across the surfaces of giant cosmic “bubbles” up to several hundred million light-years across. Inside these bubbles, few galaxies are found, so those regions are called cosmic voids. NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will allow us to measure these voids with new precision, which can tell us about the history of the universe’s expansion.

The workaround gained attention after employees and customers shared tips about paying cash to bypass T-Life. With cash now routed through the app, all standard in-store transactions appear to follow the same T-Life process. Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

    "summary": "There aren't many Android gaming handhelds this big, and this one will surely undercut the competition.",
    "body": "TL;DR The budget-focused handheld maker MANGMI has revealed its next device, called the Pocket Max. It features a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel, plus full-size sticks and front-facing speakers. Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

It’s obviously Android, but it has also long looked and felt distinctly “Samsung,” even as other Android skins borrowed ideas from all over the place. With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co. Ltd., who will hold the rights collectively under the name Picea.",

The integration seems to be rolling out in a very limited way. It allows you to use Gemini’s latest reasoning models while still being able to jump back to NotebookLM when needed.

That’s when farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and other states burn off plant “stubble” after the rice harvest. When winds are weak and the atmosphere becomes stagnant, the haze can push levels of air pollution several times higher than limits recommended by the World Health Organization .

For a second there, Samsung had all of us fooled with dreams of a refreshed line-up consisting of a new Galaxy S26 Pro, an Edge, and an Ultra, which would’ve been a nice departure from its traditional S, S Plus, and S Ultra plans. Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android is getting a quality-of-life update that automatically turns on wireless debugging when connected to trusted Wi-Fi networks. Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

Are the hinges sturdy? How heavy/bulky is the phone? Is this folding design better or worse than the Huawei Mate XT? Well, we now have answers to all of those. My colleague Paul Jones recently went hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold at the Dubai Mall — one of the only places in the world where Samsung is demoing the phone — and he came away with a lot of thoughts about Samsung’s futuristic foldable.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Google is bringing a key Pixel 10 Pro Fold feature to the older Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In the Camera app, you can now use half of the screen to view recently captured images. The option has been available on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold since launch. I find foldables to be the ultimate productivity boosters . Not only does the extra real estate on the inner screen allow more content to be viewed at once, which can be helpful for reading, but it also serves what would typically require two screens. Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature. Meanwhile, Google only added it to its foldable lineup recently with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold , and the feature has been exclusive to it since launch. Thankfully, t…",

    "body": "TL;DR JMGO has launched the JMGO O3, a compact and affordable ultra-short-throw (UST) laser projector. The unit is just 250 × 219 × 107mm and 2.4kg, far smaller than the O2S Ultra. It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",
