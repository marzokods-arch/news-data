    "body": "A week after the indie horror game Horses was banned from Steam , and just one day before it was set to launch elsewhere, Epic Games has decided that it too will not allow the game to be sold on its storefront. Publisher Santa Ragione said in a blog update that Epic informed it of the decision at 5 pm CET/11 am ET on December 1, saying the game violates its policies on \"inappropriate content\" and \"hateful or abusive content.\" Epic didn't tell Santa Ragione how exactly Horses violated its guidelines, according to an email from the publisher sent to PC Gamer, but only made what it described as \"broad and demonstrably incorrect claims\" about it. Santa Ragione filed an appeal, but it was rejected 12 hours later with no further explanation. Epic also indicated the game could be updated to bring it into compliance, but \"the email did not include any information on what would need to be changed,\" Santa Ragione said, and even if it had there'd be no way to make extensive changes one day ahead of release. Epic was not more forthcoming on the matter in a statement provided to PC Gamer. \"We set clear guidelines for the content that can be distributed on the Epic Games Store and found violati…",

    "body": "Shovel Knight was a major indie hit, with more than three million copies sold, an \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating on Steam, and a brand so recognizable it's spawned spinoffs and crossovers with games ranging from Bloodstained to For Honor . But in the 10 years since Shovel Knight first appeared, developer Yacht Club Games has struggled to produce a full-on follow-up hit, and in a new interview with Bloomberg , studio founder Cris Velasco says it will be in serious trouble if its next game isn't a success. That 'next game' would be Mina the Hollower , a sort of gothic Link's Awakening that was revealed to the world in 2022 . \"It’s make-or-break for sure,\" Velasco said. \"If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good.\" Development of Mina the Hollower has been troubled, according to the interview. The game was proposed in 2019 and work began in earnest in early 2020, when Yacht Club split into two teams, one for the full-on Shovel Knight sequel—that 3D project we heard about back in 2020, apparently—and the other to handle Mina the Hollower, which was intended to be a sma…",

The OED defines \"rage bait\" thusly: \"Online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media account.\" So essentially the manipulative tactics deployed online by many unscrupulous publishers in order to get you mad, get you clicking, and get yo…",

That trilogy, now all bound-up as Hitman: World of Assassination, has a new upcoming collaboration with Eminem. This is another area where IO has expanded cleverly: choosing celebrities that are happy to become in-game \"elusive targets\" and building missions around their personae. Hitman is never going to be Fortnite, but these collabs make enormous sense and sprinkle a little something different (as well as stardust) around every so often.

Weary of finding new ways to put Norman Reedus in videogames, the Metal Gear and Death Stranding creator is trying life on the other side of the (sort of) camera. He will be a large mole, which is also a name that could be in Metal Gear. No, really. Per Mantanweb (translated by Automaton ), Kojima will serve as the voice of Officer Paul Moledebrandt, the finest and presumably most visually disadvantaged member of the cop shop in the Japanese dub of Zootopia 2. Sure. Why not? Kojima did not, it seems, have to audition for the role, but was actually asked directly by Disney Animation Studios suit Jared Bush, CCO at the House of Mouse's animation arm. Why? Incredible question. Kojima doesn't say, but I like to hope Bush is just a massive Death Stranding stan. \"I’ve had many cameo appearances in live-action films and games, but this is my first experience dubbing for an animated theatrical film. And it’s from Disney, of all places!\" said Kojima. \"What’s more, it’s the sequel to my favourite film, Zootopia! On top of that, I received an offer directly from director Jared Bush, so I was extremely honoured and accepted without hesitation.…",

When this was announced on November 25, 2025, shares from Asetek were valued at 0.82 Danish Krone, which means this offer represents a 110% increase on the price of shares alone. Asetek has been in a bit of a weird spot this year as a major watercooling patent expired in May , losing a key advantage it had in regards to liquid cooling. The day after the buyout announcement was made, Asetek's share price went up to 1.6 Danish Krone per share, almost doubling the value overnight. In the days following this announcement, share prices have stayed consistent. Asetek's full report says, \"Based on a thorough assessment, the board of directors of Asetek has concluded that the offer represents an attractive proposal to Asetek's shareholders and has unanimously decided that it intends to recommend that Asetek shareholders accept the offer w…",

The latter will instead have to request DRAM quarterly. Y'know, because prices might rise quick enough for quarterly renegotiations to make sense. Yep, those would be Samsung v Samsung negotiations. Apparently, this \"comes as Samsung Semiconductor is restructuring its production lines to focus on high-margin products such as high-bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence accelerators and low-power DRAM for mobile devices, in an effort to maximize profitability.\" (Image credit: Samsung) It's surely the former that's the real impetus to restructure here, though.

But otherwise, Windows 10 is as dead as a doornail, right? Wrong, according to the latest Steam survey. The November edition of Steam's Hardware & Software survey reveals that Windows 10 is still clinging to life, with 29.06% of its user base still gaming on that OS. That's down by only 2.08% compared to October, with Windows 11 scooping up most of these defectors. As for the latest Windows OS itself, Windows 11 enjoyed a 2.02% increase in November, bringing its total slice of the software pie to 65.59%. So, no, we're hardly seeing folks jump from the good ship Windows 10 en masse.

    "body": "Monitors Unboxed has released its latest OLED monitor burn-in results. After 21 months , the YouTube channel found that their MSI QD-OLED monitor had degraded only marginally from the previous 18-month update . One other key takeaway is that OLED burn-in happens fastest in the first six months, after which further degradation seems to be more gradual. As before, this test is described as a worst-case scenario for OLED use and based on the MSI MPG 321URX QD-OLED , a 32-inch 4K model. That means Monitors Unboxed isn't using it for gaming but the daily computing grind with lots of static content for eight hours a day. The channel also only runs MSI's OLED panel compensation cycle at the end of the eight hour working day, not at the four-hour intervals that MSI recommends. The idea, in other words, isn't to baby this monitor but use it just as you would an LCD panel. And you don't have to break off from work in the middle of the day for 10 minutes to run compensation cycles on LCD monitors. In total, Monitors Unboxed has been running this monitor for about 60 hours a week or 250 hours per month for the past 21 months and thus has clocked up over 5,000 hours of largely static use.

OC3D claimed yesterday that the price hike will happen on the night of December 1, though we are unlikely to see the results of any such hike until the cost is pushed onto the buyer. The price change is reportedly at the distributor level, and therefore, down to those distributors to, well, distribute that price difference. With Cyber Week on , and deals still live, many sellers will be capitalising on that momentum to keep deals around for a little longer. It might not be until the sales fervour wears off that we see the impact of any increase, if one actually happens. Obviously, that's not guaranteed yet. There are currently ongoing price hikes with RAM and, to a lesser degree, SSDs , though AMD's argument is said to be unrelated.

Hell, all we really know is that you'll get an XP boost, enhanced Scrappy, an unknown amount of additional stash space, and bonus skill points based on the value of the items in your stash on the departure date (December 21). Don't ask me for specifics because, well, we don't have them. Only Embark does, and it's not telling. The only solace I can give you is that, in an update by community manager Lily on the Arc Raiders Discord server last week, it was confirmed that the \"skill point and stash space bonuses are permanent\". Additionally, they're based on your stash value and how much money you've got in your wallet at the time of departure.

The report goes on to further predict that this will have a subsequent knock-on effect for CPU sales before long.

Well, The Verge holds that honour, as this is where I learned about the File Explorer bug in Microsoft's KB5070311 update for Windows 11 . As is the norm in such update reports, the description of the issue tries to downplay the problem a tad: \"After installing KB5070311, you might experience issues when opening File Explorer in dark mode. The window might briefly display a blank white screen before loading files and folders.\" But that's not the only scenario where Windows 11 will try to make you see stars: \"This can also occur when you: Navigate to or from Home or Gallery (including launching to Home); Create a new tab; Turn t…",

But, after sinking hours of my life into my empire, I can't lie—the machines and their stock started to get a little repetitive. It's almost like Vending Dokan sensed this, as a brand new update has added a plethora of new machines for me to fill back alleys with. And, to make things even more exciting, these machines aren't just all about drinks anymore either. As shared in an announcement posted to Steam , a \"companion machine\" type has been added to the game. What this means is these machines don't require stock, but instead increase customer satisfaction just by having them around. They are also great ways to make passive income without having to stop what you're doing and restock. The first addition is the ice machine, which is \"perfect for anyone grabbing a canned, bottled, or pouched drink\".

Hot on the heels of a rumour claiming Intel has convinced Apple to make chip at its foundry comes new analysis showing an uptick in market share for Arc GPUs. Just don't get too excited. Intel's Arc GPUs have gone from basically nothing to 1% of the market. But 1% is better than no percent, right? The new data comes from research outfit JPR. They claim Intel is now showing up in their latest add-in GPU market share figures for the third quarter of 2025 to the tune of 1% , up from 0% in recent quarters. 1% is better than no percent. (Image credit: JPR) It's not clear exactly which graphics cards are responsible for Intel's relative sales success. But we're presumably talking Battlemage-derived boards, perhaps the Intel Arc B580 or its professional cousin the Intel Arc Pro B60. AMD is also up, from 6% to 7%. Nvidia is thus down by 2% from 94% to 92%. Woe is Nvidia. Not. Of course, this is but one data point from one research outfit. How accurate JPR's figures really are, that's hard to say. However, there is at least one alternative data point that suggests caution in drawing immediate conclusions could be wise. …",

And that has lead some industry observers to conclude the crisis will run through 2028, and perhaps even beyond. \"Rather than rapidly expanding facilities, we will pursue a strategy of maintaining long-term profitability,\" a Samsung rep said during a recent investor relations call (via Tech Insight ), adding, \"we will minimize the risk of oversupply through a capital expenditure (CAPEX) strategy that balances customer demand and pricing.\" Currently, Samsung says it's only able to fulfill 70% of DRAM orders. SK Hynix, meanwhile, sounded a slightly more aggressive note in terms of investment in expanded production. But still warned that meeting demand will not be easy. \"We plan to invest approximately 30% of our sales in facilities in 2026 and accelerate the transition to 1c DRAM, but it will be difficult to resolve the supply shortage,\" the company said.

I've had my eye on a few holiday horror releases like Sleep Awake and Routine, because of course I want to celebrate the most wonderful time of the year with tales of an insomnia plague and a haunted lunar base. Then there's Skate Story—which is about a less-haunted, but equally weird, moon—and Unbeatable, a rhythmic adventure game set in a world where music is illegal. December's schedule also features the usual end-of-year shows, including our very own PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted , and The Game Awards a week after. If you're still hurting for something to do, then keep on scrollin' to the end, where I've outlined the dates for Steam's Winter sale, games with big updates on the way, and even more new releases.

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. Greetings from a post-Thanksgiving stupor, FPS enjoyers. I had a nice AFK holiday with family, but in the back of my mind I was riding the high of the night before, when my friends managed to assemble a party of nine Master Chief Collection owners (shout out to the $10 Steam sale) to play classic Halo 3 custom games. It was a blast, and if you have any fondness for early Forge creations like Halo Jenga (seen below), I can't recommend it enough. The good times got me thinking about a PC gaming maxim that says an FPS is always better with mouse and keyboard. I was diehard about this for a long time—plenty of shooters feel fine on a controller, but I couldn't imagine a scenario where the precision of a mouse isn't a demonstrably better experience than thumbsticks. Recently, I've loosened my grip on that perspective. Yes, the mouse reigns supreme when speed and precision are major factors in a shooter, and that is often the case. Echo Po…",

Dark Souls has plenty of bosses to borrow from and the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is full of weapons that would transform how you approach each run. The beauty of Nightreign is the randomization of the items you find and the bosses you face, so even a slight update could change a lot.

But Microsoft is now exhibiting 420BLAZEIT levels of AI hysteria by imagining that the logo for Copilot, a Windows 11 feature that nobody cares about or indeed likes, belongs on its 2025 ugly Christmas sweater. This year's sweater, dubbed \" Artifact ,\" follows the fuzzy XP hills , iconic Windows 3.0 logo, and successive sweaters featuring MS Paint, Minesweeper and Clippy. This year, Clippy returns as a prominent sweater feature, but he's joined by a hodgepodge of other Windows-related logos that frankly scream \"lazy clipart compilation.\" Which might actually be a perfect aesthetic for a nostalgic ugly Christmas sweater, what with the pixel art icons for MS-DOS, Paint, MSN and Internet Explorer. But then there's Copilot. Every other icon on the sweater dates back to the 1990s with the odd exception of the Minecraft Creeper, which already feels out of place. But what d…",

And the biggest crime of all: you can't play poker. For the past 15 years, our choices of casino games in New Vegas have been limited to slot machines, blackjack, and roulette. But finally, finally , one heroic modder has added video poker. And New Vegas, at last, feels more like Present Vegas as a result. The mod by W00Z, called wGames - Introducing Video Poker , adds a classic of the video poker genre: Jacks or Better. Belly up to the machine, place a bet, and you'll be dealt five cards. Click the ones you want to hold and you'll be given new cards to replace the discarded ones. If you've got a pair of jacks, you'll win your money back. Anything higher like two-pair, three of a kind, a flush, a straight, and so on, and you'll rake in the caps. With the mod installed these new video poker terminals can be found in The Tops, Gomorrah, the Atomic Wrangler, and all other New Vegas casinos, with a lovely detail that the card backs on each machine will vary depending on which joint you're gambling in.

Time heals all wounds though, and in recent years Konami has been doing a good job of gradually bringing Metal Gear back: first with the Master Collection Volume 1, which brought the first two Metal Gear MSX titles and three Metal Gear Solid games (plus spinoffs) to modern platforms. It didn't launch in the best way, but after a year of patching I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. Then this year brought Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a ground-up but faithful remake of the beloved MGS3 that impressed almost everyone . It may not be the glorious future this series deserves, but it showed that Konami could still kick it at the top table, and produce a Metal Gear game that looks and feels like it belongs in 2025.

The three animations are flat-textured and set to Tom Petty's Love is a Long Road, the song featured in GTA 6's first trailer. The first shows a male character removing what seems to be the GTA 6 version of a Lime Bike from the rental rack, and then returning the bike to the same spot. Eagle-eyed fans had previously identified bike racks for some sort of rental company (which may well be called \"Lombike\"), so clearly this is another aspect of modern urban life that has found its way into the game. The other two animations show a character, which does resemble protagonist Lucia, clambering down from a truck bed first of all, before the second animation shows her hopping down from the truck roof to the truck bed, and then out to the ground.

Today's brought us a few interesting findings, so let's dig in. Starting with the NAND flash prices, TrendForce reports that the demand for NAND flash used in SSDs is strong. To the surprise of no one, that demand is largely fueled by large enterprises (thank you, AI), meaning that's where the manufacturers currently have their focus. The massive demand has led to a short supply, which then led to a price increase in November. The monthly average prices for wafers rose from 20% to 60%. Triple-level cell (TLC) memory was the most impacted. This type of NAND flash stores three bits of data per memory cell. Quad-level cell (QLC) NAND flash is also in high demand and short supply.

    "body": "Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser— freed from the mysterious and press-sceptical chains of his former company —has once again manifested on a podcast. Or, actually, on national UK radio, which is what they used to call podcasts back during the war. Houser popped up on Virgin Radio UK to chat with host Chris Evans (not that Chris Evans) about his new book. Along the way, though, the inevitable topic of AI and what it means for human labour and creativity reared its head. It sounds like Houser isn't quite as starry-eyed about the tech as so many other people who continue to occupy corporate C-suites. Asked if AI is going to lead us to the sunlit uplands so many tech 'visionaries' are promising, Houser is unequivocal: \"I personally don't think it will, because I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it—which is really superficial—the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models. So it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease.\" Which, I have to admit, is a pretty good simile for the AI craze. That's not to say Houser thinks gen-AI will have co…",

Oh, and that it's located in a church in San Francisco? News outfit CNN caught up with the Internet Archive, which incorporates the Wayback Machine, recently. Located on Funston Avenue in San Francisco in a large neoclassical building that used to be a Christian Scientist church, the Wayback Machine now maintains 29 years of web history. Back in 1996 at the inception of the archive, a whole year's worth of webpages added up to about 2 TB of storage. Now, a mere day soaks up 150 TB and a copy of the entire archive is 175 petabytes and counting upwards . In October, the Archive celebrated the successful storage of one trillion web pages. While a set of servers have been \"symbolically\" placed in the former church building, the whole archive isn't actually stored in the Funston Avenue locale. Most of the archive’s servers are in a warehouse outside San Francisco, with copies distributed throughout the world. Those backups aren't just prudent in the event of fire, flood or other physical catastrophe. CNN points out that the Trump administration has de…",

And before that... you get the picture. But, it seems that AMD is now quietly looking to dethrone its own top chip with a slightly improved version, dubbed the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. The CPU has just appeared on AMD's driver page (spotted by Olrak29 ) with zero fanfare and zero details. Love that for us—we get to speculate a bit. The truth is, we've already had some leaks about the 9850X3D in the last few months, so we have an idea of what to expect, but none of it has come directly from AMD. At least we now know the processor exists, so chances are that the specs are real, but you never know with these leaks. Previously, another Twitter leaker, ch11eddog , said that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D would come with a 120 W TDP, eight cores and 16 threads, 96 MB of L3 cache, and a boost clock speed of 5.6 GHz. That gives it a 400 MHz advantage over the 9800X3D. (Image credit: Future) A little bit of extra clock speed isn't much to write home about, especially when the CPU's greatest strength lies in its humongous 3D V-Cache, not…",
