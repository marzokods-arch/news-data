You'll first have to find the EMP trap in Victory Ridge (West Broken Ridge) and then go to each switch location in turn to power it down. All that said, here's how to complete Straight Record in Arc Raiders and locate the three power switches. Reach Victory Ridge and find the Old EMP trap You can find the EMP trap north of the Hydroponic Dome Complex (Image credit: Embark Studios) First off, you'll have to head to an area near West Broken Ridge, southwest of the ridge itself on the map, or directly north of the Hydroponic Dome Complex. The ridge is in the north of the map in case you've never visited.

You need to grab four of these pesky Arc items before you can upgrade your Gunsmith to level three, which is quite the challenge. As obvious as it sounds, it's worth pointing out that you get these Firing Cores from Arc Sentinels, which are sniper turrets attached to ceilings in just a few specific locations, and are different to the regular turrets you commonly encounter. You're less likely to run into these naturally compared to almost all other Arc types. With that in mind, tracking them down for their cores proves to be a time-consuming task. However, alongside the Sentinels themselves, there's also another great way to get them. So, here's where to look.

Blurbs is a modder and Twitch streamer that’s notorious for tapping into the unhinged hivemind of his viewers: utilising a combination of custom code and Twitch chat to bring to life cursed, user-generated scenarios. Since his inaugural Skyrim experiment —in which chat messages became voice lines for various NPCs—he’s created Mortal Kombat in Red Dead Redemption 2 (challenges ranging from Arthur fighting a deer, to a showdown with Dutch) and has recently turned his attention to modders' paradise GTA 5. Alas, Blurbs doesn't release his mods, so you'll have to make do with watching them on video instead. (Image credit: Rockstar Games) Getting the NPCs to commit insurance fraud was easy in Los Santos.

Usually, I'd say these people would have to pay for extraction camping in another life, but it seems like they're actually paying for it right here and now in Arc Raiders thanks to a few zealous players.

    "body": "Completing Water Troubles in Arc Raiders shouldn't give you too many problems once you've found the Flood Access Tunnel location. Just like Market Correction or A Reveal in Ruins , it's a simple two-parter consisting of tracking down a location and then interacting with an object inside—no item extraction needed, thankfully. The quest itself gives you a pretty big clue as to where to find the Flood Access Tunnel, mentioning that it's underneath Red Lake Balcony, but this isn't technically correct. The tunnel is a little ways off to the side of the balcony, explaining why this might be tripping you up. So, here's how to complete Water Troubles in Arc Raiders. Locate the Flood Access Tunnel under the Red Lake Balcony You can find the Flood Access Tunnel pipe directly to the east of the Control Tower on the basin floor (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first step is pretty straightforward; you'll want to head into the big basin area in the east of the Dam Battlegrounds map—be careful if the Harvester event is active, because this is where the queen likes to patrol. You're looking for a big open pipe directly to the east of the Control Tower , built into the lower part of the dam. If…",

That hasn't stopped some pesky console exclusives slipping through the net over the years, but these days most are coming across. Most of the best PlayStation games to play on PC come directly from Sony themselves. You only need to scroll through our review section to find deep dives into PS5's biggest hitters that have landed not long after their initial PS5 releases. I've been a PC player for a long time, as well as working across two console mags: Official PlayStation Magazine and PLAY Magazine. I first played the iconic PS1 titles Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy 7, and even PS2's Silent Hill 2 on PC. Now, the most exciting new game releases on PS5 don't take long to come to PC. It's a thrill to not only play fab indie gems on the Steam Deck, but take PS5 games on the go that would otherwise be bound to a big screen at home. I've even reviewed some of the best PlayStation games to play on PC for PC Gamer myself! So join me as I rank them below, and take a look at what you might expect to see in the future.

But there may be another reason behind those layoffs, namely that the player count for Dune: Awakening is dwindling. In fact, for the first time since Dune: Awakening launched, the number of players recently dropped below that of Funcom's other survival MMO, Conan Exiles, which released way back in 2018. The shift was spotted by Reddit user m3d1t8 (via GamesRadar ), who posted a screenshot showing that, at the time it was taken, 7,458 players were exploring Arrakis, while 7,706 players were enjoying Conan Exiles. \"The unbelievable has happened and Dune now has fewer active players than Conan,\" m3d1t8 marvelled, adding. \"I remember two months ago someone foreseeing that Dune would dip below Conan and thinking no wayyyy.

In fact, many took to the comments to declare the robot was actually just a person in a suit—after all, it wouldn't be the first time . However, company CEO He Xiaopeng has since attempted to expose the Iron's mechanical innards, both on-stage and off (via Mashable ). After offering a sneak peek of what lies beneath the Iron's soft shell on social media , Xiaopeng then took to the stage for a more drastic demonstration. For the banishment of all doubt, the Xpeng robotics team took a pair of scissors to the Iron, cutting away not only its soft outer shell but its artificial muscles as well, completely exposing the metal rod supports and servos below. The Iron is very clearly not a person in a morph suit—however, that doesn't mean it's the future either. The smoothness of this robot's movements across a completely flat surface is impressive, though I'm a little unclear on what gap in the market the Iron hopes to fill as it approaches mass …",

However, even though players are still mastering the art of dodging the Birthday Boy's balloons and outrunning the Loom, semiwork has already uploaded a video to YouTube sharing that preparations for the game's next update are underway. With that said, there is no information regarding its contents, or when to expect it. Only that there will be another update in due course. In fact, the video opens the floor to players to share what they'd like to see when REPO receives its next drop rather than the decision being down to the devs. Since we've just received a fresh batch of monsters, I can't imagine we'll be getting any new creatures any time soon, but a lot of people are keen to see new locations over anything else. As part of the monster update, REPO received a bunch of new valuables too, each corresponding to their location rather than being a random selection available through each map. So I don't doubt a new location would inevitably result in more valuable variation. However it seems like a huge number of players would like some sort of progression as well, rather tha…",

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, fresh off the company being valued at $5 trillion , recently went out to Hsinchu County in northwestern Taiwan to acknowledge TSMC's role in Nvidia's success. \"Without TSMC, there is no Nvidia today\", the Nvidia chief said at TSMC's Sports Day last week ( via Focus Taiwan ). This is certainly true. You see TSMC chips in everything from the latest Blackwell GPUs (like the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 ) to the AI chips that have helped prop up Nvidia's worth. Huang told the crowd, \"You are really the pride of Taiwan, you are also the pride of the world, and you know that you are also my pride\". Huang was born in Taiwan and has Taiwanese citizenship, which might give extra reason for that last part. TSMC is in a unique spot for Taiwan, being one of the biggest companies in the country. The looming threat of tariffs has caused some worries around supply, but it has a fab in Arizona, with more expected to come, and a $100 billion investment was made in the US earlier this year.

Elsewhere, a French website Dealabs (via Gamespot ) provided further evidence of the symbols' authenticity, discovering the words \"crossbuy-tag\" within some CSS files on the PlayStation Store. Since the term \"Cross-Buy\" has been used by Sony since the PS-Vita days, Dealabs also checked when the new symbols were added to the store, and discovered they first appeared in June this year.

YouTuber and minimalist hardware extraordinaire Vimpo has created a tiny custom Minecraft server implementation for machines with limited resources—and to show off its potential, they've got it running on a smart bulb , of all things. The Aliexpress-bought Wi-Fi lightbulb had the glass structure sawn off with a serrated knife, exposing the tiny BL602 RISC-V chip inside, before the board was soldered to a surrogate microcontroller with an appropriate USB port and a few extra wires. This looks to have enabled the now Frankenstein-ed bulb board to run Vimpo's own Minecraft server implementation, called Ucraft. Controlling the bulb-based server with the help of a few other devices, including a small external display and a full-sized keyboard that frankly dwarfs every other piece of hardware involved, results in a very-playable looking implementation. If you'd like a poke around in Ucraft's files, Vimpo has uploaded their work to GitHub .

Helldivers 2, in contrast, has an all-time peak of just 458,709 , and that's including my squad.

On November 7, Owlcat shared the game's main theme from composer Paweł Perepelica, who previously scored Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous and Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader for the studio. It's hard get crazy excited about music from an upcoming game, but Osiris Reborn's main theme kinda goes. That combination of a very space opera, orchestral sound with more cyberpunk synths puts me right back in that 2007, saving the galaxy headspace. It doesn't hurt that Mass Effect and The Expanse draw from the same well of gritty, '90s and aughts, military-inflected, Sci-Fi Syfy Channel sci-fi⁠—even if Mass Effect tempered it with a more wide eyed, mid-20th century sensibility.

More recently, YouTuber Fully Buffered (via Tom's Hardware ) got the game to run on an AMD FX-9590 CPU , first released in 2013, revealing that the game's stated minimum required specs are a bit misleading. Fully Buffered broke down his process in the above video, where he shows the game running on the 12-year-old chip to a quality standard he calls \"not terrible.\" It peaks at around mid-40 FPS at lower resolutions, though input lag kneecaps the feasibility of playing this way for very long. The poor GPU, an RX 5700, is shown hovering around 30% utilization in Task Manager, its potency shown a hard ceiling by the comparatively ancient processor. Regardless, it's remarkable that it runs at all—and not just because of the severe bottleneck. As the video highlights, Battlefield 6 requires Trusted Platform Module 2.0—a fe…",

When PC Gamer online editor Fraser Brown gave the game a spin , he said \"stepping into the sandals of my Greek hero felt like travelling back in time to a simpler era, when you could enjoy an ARPG without intense number crunching, theorycrafting or engaging in live service systems.\" In fact, he said in his impressions the game was occasionally so placid that it didn't quite live up to the grand stakes of Greek legend—though the game has been upping the ante with new regions and bosses since its early access launch.

Character Select Welcome to Character Select, a weekly column where PC Gamer takes a look at the art and cosplay created by you. Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. When I started playing Minecraft, the way most people would dress as the characters involved a large cardboard box atop their shoulders, and then wearing a colour-coordinated outfit to match the character. It was simple but incredibly effective. After all, all you really need to identify a Minecraft character are its main features, and for the most part these were on its head and face.

It’s because that core game was so good I’m actually excited to play another compilation of Bandai Namco’s 80s classics—Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, anything you’d expect to see wallowing in the corner of a local greasy spoon. In a DLC announced earlier this year without a release window, those games and a few others will finally be woven into the collection this Thursday, Nov. 13. If you’re like me, you have more Namco compilations and miscellaneous ports of Pac-Man than you know what to do with, but this is more than just another re-release. On top of the archived art, photos, and developer interviews, this DLC is set to include three Atari ports of Pac-Man: 2600, 5200, and the version released on Atari 8-bit computers.

Not that I'm suggesting any kind of weird conspiracy on Valve's part to kill off a relatively obscure space strategy game from 2017. But it is an interesting coincidence.

In Promise Mascot Agency, those mascots aren't just people dressed as a baby otter with a tortoise for a hat or whatever. Every big pink cat or walking block of tofu you see is a real living being who has to earn a living by opening shops and cultural events. WHY I LOVE (Image credit: Kaizen Game Works) In Why I Love , PC Gamer writers pick an aspect of PC gaming that they love and write about why it's brilliant. This week, Jody appreciates Promise Mascot Agency's trucky charms. It's your job as an exiled yakuza with the same voice actor and off-the-charts unflappability as Kazuma Kiryu from the Like a Dragon games to manage those mascots, assigning them jobs, negotiating their bonuses, and bailing them out when things go wrong. It's like Kiryu got sick of that real estate management minigame and decided to try something less mundane. That's just one slice of the strange cake that is Promise Mascot Agency. Equal emphasis is given to the time between jobs where you drive around a Japanese island in a boxy little kei truck. I've heard Promise Mascot…",

This 2D point-and-click from 2015 brought a Tim Burton flair to the genre, tasking you with saving your family—including Grandpa-raffin and Mothdog—from the dark monsters that have overtaken your home. Bringing light to the darkness is made a bit easier by the fact you are Bulb Boy, a boy who can unscrew your lightbulb head to help you solve puzzles. Also, you're immune to being electrocuted, just in case that should ever come in handy. It's a puzzle-adventure in the Machinarium style, full of secrets and silliness. Bulb Boy is currently available for free on Steam to bring attention to its recently released sequel, Bulb Boy 2: Jar of Despair . This time, Bulb Boy's mission is to find a jam jar in the cellar of the Bulb House, a simple task made nightmarish by the creature who wants to take your head for its own. It's got a demo if you want to try before you buy. The Bulb Boy adventures are twisted affairs that look like they're entirely made up of the…",

But we've also had an update on the latest chapter in the life of Demetrian Titus, protagonist of the bolterporn action games in the Space Marine series. After debuting as a captain of the Ultramarines in the first Space Marine, he was busted down to lieutenant for the sequel, and as we see in the trailer has now regained his former title. As of this promotion he's captain of the Second Company in place of Acheran, the guy in Space Marine 2 who constantly tells you he can only spare three men. Maybe that's why Acheran was demoted, although it's more likely he's dead or in a dreadnought. I'm sure we'll find out later. With that new rank comes a new responsibility.

It's easy to dismiss videogame recipe books as a frivolous marketing gimmick, and I'm as guilty of this as anyone else. My original plan for this article was to find the most preposterous example of a gaming-themed cookbook, then attempt to recreate the silliest recipe from it. I assumed this would be easy. I mean, nobody could actually write a good Sonic-themed cookbook, could they? Yet when I looked into this odd corner of gaming culture, I noticed two things. First, many of the gaming-themed recipe books you'll find on Amazon are not only well designed, but they're also filled with dishes that look like something you would actually want to eat. Second, many of them are written (or co-written) by the same author—Victoria Rosenthal. Final Fantasy 14 futomaki rolls (Image credit: Insight Editions) This is not a coincide…",

It seems like Arc Raiders has successfully bridged the gap between the sickos and the rest of us, though, as not only is it the extraction shooter of choice for the chronically employed —it's one of the biggest games on Steam. According to SteamDB , the game is off to a screaming start, just hitting a peak concurrent player count of over 354,000 Friday night. That's a wild number for any shooter, especially given that the game only released a little over a week ago. It even briefly overtook Battlefield 6 , one of the biggest games on Steam in general right now , with BF6 settling in at around 318,000 players around midnight UTC Saturday morning and Arc Raiders sneaking past it with over 329,000. Arc Raiders can't match the long-running shooter's soaring highs, but it's drawn in a huge and consistent audience in its first week.

This week I've been: continuing to team up with players in Arc Raiders, and blasting the mean ones. As much as I love the nail-biting tension of extraction shooters, it's long been a genre obsessed with a rigorous gear grind and slow pace that make it almost impenetrable for new players, or those that can't dedicate more than a few hours a day or even a week. The one exception to this until now has been Hunt: Showdown , and while I can't recommend it enough, let's face it, it's not your typical extraction shooter. So, for all these years, the extraction shooter has remained the dominion of a select few with enough time and patience to dedicate to it—and invariably trounce anyone who dares to give it a casual go. Of course, with enough time and determination, you'll eventually join that elite band, but my point is that the genre isn't known for being welcoming and even semi-casual. If you want a genre to truly grow and experiment, encouraging a more diverse audience will do it. Just as I thought perhaps the genre would never become truly …",

Hence, it would only be fair for Offworld to copy Arrowhead's homework a little, which appears to be the case for the cooperative spinoff's latest update. Update 1.8 will primarily introduce a Company progression system to Extermination when it arrives later in November. But I'm more intrigued by its tertiary feature—in-game airstrikes.
