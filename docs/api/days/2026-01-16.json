The design features a unique trifold form with three separate displays, allowing a streamer to view chat, gameplay, and metrics simultaneously. While the bill of materials is ~$1,838, the total R&amp;D to bring it to life is estimated at a staggering $55 million. Imagine if a phone company really paid attention to its wildest customer ideas. That’s exactly what Nothing did. In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price. The video presents the project as a fun challenge rather than a product launch. And while you can’t buy this phone, the engineering behind it offers an interesting glimpse of what highly specialized smartphones could be like in the future.",

    "body": "Credit: Google TL;DR Nano Banana was a last-minute codename cooked up at 2:30 AM for the Gemini image model going live on LMArena. The name comes from a Google Product Manager’s personal nicknames, and the internet loved it. The branding stuck, went viral, and now lives on as Nano Banana Pro. If you’ve heard of or used AI image generators, you’ve definitely come across Google’s Nano Banana . Even if you’re not into using AI to create images, you’ve probably seen Nano Banana’s work all over social media. The image model is freakishly good at editing and generating images, and we’re sure that, like us, you’ve always wondered what made Google name it Nano Banana. Now, we finally have the full answer, and the story behind the delightfully silly name.",

The request centers on the still-unshipped T1 Phone and Trump Mobile’s handling of preorders and marketing. Lawmakers say the case should be treated like any other consumer protection issue, regardless of politics. My colleague C. Scott Brown ordered the T1 Phone back in June. Seven months later, he still doesn’t have the Trump phone , a shipping date, or much clarity on what he actually paid a $100 deposit for. Now, that long-running mess may be about to draw federal scrutiny, after Democratic lawmakers asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Trump Mobile over alleged false advertising and deceptive practices. The request comes in a letter (h/t The Verge ) from 11 Democratic lawmakers, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Robert Garcia. It focuses on Trump Mobile’s still-unreleased T1 Phone, announced more than six months ago and still accepting deposits despite not yet shipping anything to customers.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority Another CES , another step closer to the future that Black Mirror warned us about. This year, that moment came courtesy of Razer and its latest experiment in AI companionship, Project Ava. It’s an AI-powered gaming assistant designed to sit on your desk, analyze what’s happening on-screen, and offer real-time advice. It also seems to want to be a bit more than that at times, so we decided to poll you about how you feel about it. We’ve already made our feelings clear on the subject after our own Joe Maring spent some hands-on time with Project Ava at CES 2026. While he found parts of the tech genuinely interesting, like its ability to quickly scan game menus and suggest loadouts, the overall experience left him more creeped out than impressed. The giggling, the attempts at playful banter, and the clear push toward forming a “bond” with the AI overshadowed the more practical gaming-assistant side of the device. But it’s your opinion we care most about, so we put a poll in Joe’s article asking if you’d consider buying Project Ava.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Apple is working on end-to-end encryption for RCS in iOS 26.3 Beta 2. The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

American Spotify users dodged the 2025 round of global price hikes , but that was always going to be a temporary reprieve. As sure as night follows day, Spotify is once again asking US subscribers to pay a little more for Premium. From your February billing date, the Individual Premium plan will increase from $11.99 per month to $12.99. Spotify confirmed the change in a Newsroom post , along with an example of the email landing in subscribers’ inboxes. The company frames the increase as a way to keep delivering “a great experience,” without pointing to any specific new features arriving alongside the higher price. Estonian and Latvian users will also see a price increase.",

Nintendo 3DS emulation has seen a major resurgence in interest with dual-screen gaming handhelds like the AYN Thor and Pocket DS coming out, but its best emulator hasn’t seen a new stable release in five months. Today, that streak ends, with Azahar Release 2124 dropping what its developers promise to be its “largest update ever.” One of the most significant changes for Android users is a simple default settings tweak, which yields a noticeable decrease in input latency. Previous versions had Vsync enabled by default as a way to reduce screen tearing in games. However, Android has its own frame pacing feature that performs a similar function. It has now been disabled by default, with the code around it cleaned up and consolidated.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We were able to get our first look at Android’s upcoming Intrusion Logging feature. It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

With AutoPay, three lines cost $140/month before taxes, or about $46 per line. You get 250GB of high-speed mobile hotspot data, and the plan includes 30GB of high-speed data usable in Canada, Mexico, and over 215 international destinations. In a bold move aimed squarely at poaching customers from Verizon and AT&amp;T, T-Mobile has launched its new Better Value Plan , offering strong benefits for people who use a lot of data and those who travel internationally. The main difference is not just a lower monthly price. T-Mobile wants customers to get valuable features without paying for the highest tier. With AutoPay, three lines cost $140 per month before taxes and fees, or about $46 per line.",

But with this revamp, Google also changes a key alarm functionality, replacing its snooze and dismiss sliders with buttons. However, the option to use a slider may be returning soon. Instead of just bringing the option back, Google may also revamp it by giving users the option to choose between the slider and the buttons.",

While patents don’t always lead to real products, it’s good to see that Google is exploring more repair-friendly hardware designs. Google has filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) outlining a new way to design batteries inside phones and other devices so that they can be removed or replaced more easily and safely. The new battery design is even more impressive because it doesn’t sacrifice the slim, sealed build that modern, premium smartphones and tablets are known for.",

Parents will soon be able to disable Shorts on their teens’ YouTube app. A new onboarding workflow for kid accounts lets parents better control what their kids have access to. The YouTube app offers a handful of tools to help individual users impose limitations on their viewing, with options for periodic reminders to take breaks or go to bed . Parents whose children are using supervised YouTube accounts can control these features on their kids’ devices, and today, YouTube announced some new options to let parents further restrict their kids’ viewing. In a blog post, YouTube outlined new limits on Shorts videos for supervised teen accounts (the YouTube Kids app doesn’t have a Shorts tab). Parents are able to set a daily limit on time kids can watch shorts videos, with the option to set that limit to zero — disabling the Shorts feed altogether — coming “soon.”",

A very public incident involving the Samsung Galaxy Ring saw a user sent to hospital after the ring swelled on his finger while he was about to board a flight. It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new Galaxy S26 rumor suggests Samsung might actually upgrade charging speeds on the base variant. Instead of the regular 25W charging, the base Galaxy S26 might support 45W charging. While the rumor had previously been refuted, it has resurfaced, making us wonder whether it’s actually true. The Galaxy S26 series has been one of the most confusing upcoming launches. We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is preparing a new battery-preserving feature that will limit frequent backups. We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",
