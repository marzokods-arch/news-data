First things first: I don't know if this is a serious offer.

An auction house would cut out the in-person interactions, but Watkins reckons that would undermine Arc Raiders' intentional emphasis on finding items yourself. \"We put a lot of very, very deliberate effort into making the game about the items,\" Watkins said. \"We previously explored and even partially built a trading system like [an auction house].

DieDevDie cameo in Quarantine Zone (Image credit: Brigada Games) Turns out, this odd-looking guy is based on the avatar of a TikTok and YouTube creator called DieDevDie who also provides voice acting for the character. This is one of a number of content creator cameos in Quarantine Zone, a little easter egg for anyone who happens to be familiar with them. Other than the change in appearance and some new voice lines, investigating these cameo survivors works the exact same way as a standard investigation . For example, when I investigated the skeleton, I checked him for all of the usual symptoms and found that he had a crossed reflex, meaning he was infected.

Now I'm playing Pathogenic , another game that pulls off the same trick. All these years later, one of EA's weirdest experiments seems to be occupying hearts and minds once more. Where Everything is Crab reimagines Spore's \"creature stage\", Pathogenic is (as you might have guessed from the name) a take on the \"cell stage\".

In turn, Taiwan will boost its investment in the US tech industry, particularly when it comes to the production of silicon for AI. U.S. commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that this deal will see Taiwan putting $250 ‌billion towards not only AI or semiconductor production, but energy as well (via Reuters ). This figure includes $100 billion from chipmaker TSMC, which it already committed to investing last year as part of a long term plan to build new fabs in the US . Both TSMC and the Taiwanese government have also committed to investing more in the future, with the country committing to guarantee an additional $250 billion in credit. The hope is that all this money from Taiwan will encourage reciprocal investment in the country from the US. Vice Premier Cheng said, \"In this negotiation, we promoted two-way Taiwan–U.S. high-tech investment, hoping that in the future we can become close AI strategic partners.\" Reading between the lines of this optimistic statement, there's still plenty of uncertainty.

The tech in question is Google's Fast Pair system, which allows compatible devices to connect super quickly (i.e. one tap and you're done). As reported by Wired , researchers at KU Leuven University in Belgium analysed a range of different audio devices and discovered that the Bluetooth protocols used were vulnerable to being remotely hacked.

Once in, they could do something as innocent as change volume levels or, far more worryingly, listen to what the microphones are picking up.

Although this could be due to Candleberries being surprisingly hard to find in Arc Raiders, and not just because hardly anyone was interested in completing the task. (Image credit: Embark Studios) But there was more than just Candleberries to find out in the snow. During the Cold Snap, raiders could also enjoy snowball fights while slowly dying of hypothermia. 95 million snowballs were thrown over the course of the Cold Snap, with 10,577 arcs being taken down by one, and 91 raiders getting knocked out by them, a surprisingly low number if I'm being honest. Snowballs only did about one damage per hit, so it would take a …",

If you just want to know the nine kinds of quest, then here they are: murder, kill, the infamous fetch quest, collect, delivery, the often maligned escort quest, talk, puzzle, and timed. Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains. We all know what a fetch quest is—go here, get this item. A collect quest is different in the same way a kill quest is—gather a set amount of an item, like 20 nirnroot. A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person. An escort quest is similar, only you need to deliver a person instead of an item, so they're often trickier. All of The Last of Us can be considered one long escort quest. One that sounds obviou…",

And if SK Hynix's developments with PLC chips come to fruition, we could see a return to sensible SSD prices. PLC or Penta-Level Cell flash chips aren't a new thing, as Intel, Toshiba, and SK Hynix all started working on their development a little over six years ago. Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable. Flash memory cells work by using a large voltage to effectively ram electric charge across an insulated gap. Once there, it can remain stored for very long periods of time before requiring a top-up. Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information. That only requires the voltage sensors with the flash chips to read one voltage, which is very quick and simple to do. However, because it's …",

For a game that feels so heavily centred around its online competitive scene, it should be a dealbreaker. But Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hoists itself up with some of the cleanest, most robust kart racing I've seen on PC, tracks that leave a ton of room for experimentation and optimisation, vehicle customisation I could only dream of in other mascot-centric kart racers, and an abundance of unserious trash talk that feels so on-brand for the Sonic cast (Big: \"You look tense, buddy.

I might, however, blow off the dust and give it another whirl, because my favourite boy, the Executor, just got a huge sweep of buffs. Oh, and also, like, Guardians and Revenants and Raiders, but who cares about that—my Sekiro-loving heart just got everything it ever wanted. I'll just be going through the Nightfarers caught up in the patch 1.03.2 buffs one by one, starting with my favourite: The Executor's Cursed Sword skill, the thing that lets you parry, is now a lot stronger. Higher critical hits, better guard boost, more stagger damage when you deflect, and deflecting successfully while on low stamina won't result in a guard break anymore. I'm yet to test this myself, but the implication is that even on zero stamina, if your timing's good, you can just ride the lightning and never die. My timing is not good, so I imagine I'll be dying a lot, but the aspiration of a clutch moment or two is something to shoot for. T…",

I thought of the Maxwell's aluminum and steel chassis, the space-age drivers, and the feeling that your money had gone on something boutique. I anticipated the delivery with relish. You can imagine my surprise when what I pulled from the box looked… fairly ordinary. Dull, even. More than that, the weight threw me for a loop the second I wrenched the set from its cardboard insert. The Inzone H9 II feels astonishingly light. Almost to the point of suspicion, if I'm honest. I'm used to ultralight gaming mice for premium prices, but light-as-a-feather wireless gaming headsets? Initially, it feels a little flimsy. Hollow, even. Then there's the headband.

This is what is being claimed by Tim Culpan , a technology reporter based in Taiwan. With years of experience at Bloomberg behind him, he is as good a source as you're going to get, unless any of the aforementioned parties decide to spill the beans directly. It certainly makes sense, though, because while the phone market is dominated by Apple , and is currently enjoying a marked rise in market share, the number of wafers it requires from TSMC will surely be less than what Nvidia is asking for. You only have to compare the physical size of their chips to realise this. Apple's latest A19 processor, as used in the iPhone 17, is manufactured via TSMC's N3P process node. It has a die area of around 100 square millimetres, which means a standard 300 mm wafer can yield many hundreds of dies. At the moment, Nvidia uses TSMC's N4 node for its current produc…",

As I use Notepad daily, I was already aware of the new additions, but it's thanks to Windows Latest that I know everyone using Windows 11 should see them, too. Well, perhaps not the AI text streaming, because that's apparently still only for Copilot+ PCs (ones with a CPU that has a 40+ TOPS NPU in them), though Microsoft says it will eventually roll it out to all Windows 11 systems. The table function is blessedly simple in form and function, and if you're already familiar with tables in Microsoft Word, you'll have no problems using this one. You start by clicking on the icon in the menu bar, then dragging out the initial table you want to use.

So it's not at all surprising that the biggest new feature of Yakuza Kiwami 3's Dark Ties expansion is a roguelite mode that lets you beat up hordes of thugs copy-pasted from the streets of Kamurochō. Even so, there's something cleverly meta in building an entirely new and compulsively replayable randomized mode out of spare parts. It's almost a flex on games that do just one thing. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth contained within itself a whole Pokémon subsystem and Animal Crossing-style island building as mere side activities; why shouldn't Dark Ties tempt you to spend 20 hours doing runs to level up sidekicks, unlock new weapons, and earn stat-boosting gear like you would in any other roguelite?

Released in 1998 and 1999, neither has been re-released in any sort of arcade collection or made available digitally until now, via in-game emulation in Yakuza 3 Kiwami. Both are delightful. Magical Truck Adventure is classic Sega arcade stuff: bright and bubbly and immediately throwing all sorts of stuff at the screen within seconds. You take control of one of two kids operating an old-fashioned train handcar, chasing down a pair of crooks who've stolen your magical jewel and decided to flee by rail, making them incredibly easy to catch. At least if you're in good shape: the physical arcade machine requires you to constantly pump the handcar's lever to maintain speed, while a pair of pedals allow you to lean left or right off the rails and jump over the barrels and other random obstacles they hurl your way.

Grace's parts will resemble Resident Evil 2 and 7, and will be \"really entrenched in the horror aspects of the gameplay\". In other words, expect to do a lot of creeping around in the shadows, a lot of urgent crafting in corners, and every bullet expended will count. Leon's parts will predictably channel the \"thrilling tension\" of Resident Evil 4, as well as its action focus. If you've ever wanted to deliver a roundhouse kick to a shambling zombie nurse, have I got good news for you. \"Each part is ordered to offer the ultimate balance of tension and release,\" Nakanishi explained. It's an interesting approach to blend the two primary Resi gameplay styles together, and this hybrid presentation was settled on when the team realised they couldn't have it both ways with just Leon. \"We actually tried to make a genuine horror game with Leon,\" Nakanishi say…",

It's not a metroidvania this time, but rather a single-screen platformer mixing simple Astalon-style combat with puzzles. I played the demo last year and goddamn does this game feel good . While the puzzles generally boil down to \"grab key, reach exit\", the final game promises over 50 levels, so who knows where the team will take it. At the end of every level there's a randomized \"event scene\" pulled from \"hundreds of outcomes\", which include interactions with a huge cast of characters, as well as loot and/or boss battles. LABS Works is again working with Matt Kap…",

Or maybe those will just be modifiers applied to existing maps, but Watkins' main point is that Embark isn't interested in adding maps just to have new places to do the same old thing. \"The ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot avai…",

And in case the significance of Okada's input was unclear to you, Compile Hearts has you covered: they describe the game as “Okada’s ultimate message to those who will lead the next generation”. Compile Heart launched a teaser website today featuring an oblique, sci-fi trailer loosely reminiscent of the Megami Tensei universe, albeit with a slight horror bent. A name wasn't revealed nor a release window, but Compile Hearts has promised a proper reveal on January 29. Okada is joined by writer Tadashi Satomi, who is credited as a scenario writer for Persona 2 and Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga and its sequel, among others.

Comments on YouTube accusing the trailer of being made with generative AI began flowing almost immediately after it was posted. Some called out specific characters who look AI generated; quite a few others made the point that SNK is backed by serious money now and shouldn't be looking to cut corners with gen AI. SNK was effectively acquired in 2022 by Saudi Arabia's Electronic Gaming Development Company , a division of the Mohammed bin Salman Foundation. Bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia (and credibly accused murderer ), is the prime mover behind the $55 billion buyout of Electronic Arts.

Here's the full photo: (Image credit: Amazon) Overall, the reveal seems to have gone better than Netflix's 2018 reveal of Henry Cavill as Geralt . Cavill's makeup and costuming ended up looking respectable in the show, but it was hard to tell that was going to be the case from our first look—that wig sure looked wiggy. In contrast, Turner's Lara seems to be fairly uncontroversial; not everyone's favorite take on the character, but there's no big upset over it. (In saying that, I do have to exclude X's substantial population of massive losers, who have taken to complaining about the actor's proportions and using Grok to alter the photo in replies to the official Tomb Raider account .

Depending on your point of view, Bungie's Marathon reboot might have the most generous or restrictive free loadout of the bunch. As detailed in a new vidoc showing off all of Marathon's runner shells (essentially hero characters), Bungie says Rook is a unique class option that functions like a free loadout. You can't bring anything in with you, but you're supplied with basic kit for free and can keep whatever you find on a raid. That's more-or-less how the free loadout works in Arc Raiders, the most popular extraction shooter of the moment, but Bungie's implementation is different in two major ways: Rook players will always enter a match late, making it harder to compete for the best loot on the map Rook players can only queue solo Depending on where you land on Arc Raiders' free loadout debate , that could be fantastic news.

The length of runs is perfect, there's the perfect amount of distractions to regularly pull you away from the best-laid plans, and the exhilaration of making it out never gets old. And yet… man, do I dislike my inventory. It's slightly weird that a game that gets so much bang-on fumbles when it comes to inventory management and loadouts. Your stash is a key part of these games: it's what you're going in for, after all. But I really find it a bit of a pain sometimes in Arc Raiders, especially when I just want to get back in there without clicking through 15 screens and working out what I can and can't recycle or sell. It's the one bit of the game's rhythm that feels off. Turns out I'm far from alone. Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins told PCG sister site GamesRadar+ that Embark Studios is \"super aware\" of players' gripes around loadouts and shuffling items around between runs. And with regard to the game lacking custom loadouts, which players could quickly shuffle between runs, he says \"we've talked about\" them and it…",

You’re not getting quite the same level of GPU power or build quality either, but a cheaper laptop like the Acer Nitro V15 can still produce the goods. And the heat. And the noise. Acer has taken a trip back in time for the V15, with the model sent to PCG for review sporting a Core i7 13620H processor. That’s a Raptor Lake chip with ten cores split between four P-cores and six E-cores for 16 simultaneous software threads thanks to the 13th Gen coming before the death of P-core Hyper-Threading. It’s a chip from 2023, but its max turbo frequency of 4.9 GHz means it’s still competitive, even if it puts out a lot of heat and drives the Nitro’s cooling system crazy.
