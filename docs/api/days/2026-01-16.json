These will be the worst phones of 2026 on an expectation-to-reality scale; we all expect Samsung to do better. The lack of significant upgrades also makes waiting for the regular Galaxy S26 a huge waste of time, in my opinion.

Despite their new names, the chipsets repackage designs from previous generations with minimal upgrades. The move appears inspired by Qualcomm’s recent launch of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. Over the years, MediaTek’s flagship Dimensity chips have improved enough to put up a tough fight against Qualcomm’s Elite mobile chips. The latest Dimensity 9500 proved to be too close to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in our testing. Now, just a few months after its release, MediaTek is launching a slightly less powerful variant, the Dimensity 9500s, likely geared towards affordable flagships. Along with it, MediaTek has also launched the Dimensity 8500, which might be geared towards the upper mid-range. Dimensity 9500 The Dimensity 9500s is built on TSMC’s N3E 3nm process, the same as the 9500, and maintains the same CPU architecture with “all big cores.” But instead of deploying Arm’s flagship and the newest C1 cores, the Dimensity 9500s uses older Cortex-X925 at 3.73GHz for the prime core, complemented by three Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Arm Cortex-A720 cores at undisclosed clock speeds.

The design features a unique trifold form with three separate displays, allowing a streamer to view chat, gameplay, and metrics simultaneously. While the bill of materials is ~$1,838, the total R&amp;D to bring it to life is estimated at a staggering $55 million. Imagine if a phone company really paid attention to its wildest customer ideas. That’s exactly what Nothing did. In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price. The video presents the project as a fun challenge rather than a product launch. And while you can’t buy this phone, the engineering behind it offers an interesting glimpse of what highly specialized smartphones could be like in the future.",

The fresh cut “started as something I wanted to tell a friend,” the award-winning artist explains. “We’ve never been the heart-to-heart types, so I wrote it in a song instead,” he continues. “I wanted to tell him that even though he has made mistakes along the way, he shouldn’t be so hard on himself.

Seven months later, he still doesn’t have the Trump phone , a shipping date, or much clarity on what he actually paid a $100 deposit for. Now, that long-running mess may be about to draw federal scrutiny, after Democratic lawmakers asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Trump Mobile over alleged false advertising and deceptive practices. The request comes in a letter (h/t The Verge ) from 11 Democratic lawmakers, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Robert Garcia. It focuses on Trump Mobile’s still-unreleased T1 Phone, announced more than six months ago and still accepting deposits despite not yet shipping anything to customers.",

While he found parts of the tech genuinely interesting, like its ability to quickly scan game menus and suggest loadouts, the overall experience left him more creeped out than impressed. The giggling, the attempts at playful banter, and the clear push toward forming a “bond” with the AI overshadowed the more practical gaming-assistant side of the device.

The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

Full retail availability may have to wait until early March. When a company is coming out with a new product, its debut can involve so many different moving pieces that it can be tricky to nail down specific dates of interest. Do we care most about when to expect the big, formal announcement? When we can start placing pre-orders? When pre-orders are expected to ship? Or just the ultimate date of regular retail availability? With Google’s Pixel 10a now creeping up on us fast, some notable leakers are sharing some very different info about the dates we should be keeping in mind.

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We were able to get our first look at Android’s upcoming Intrusion Logging feature. It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

You get 250GB of high-speed mobile hotspot data, and the plan includes 30GB of high-speed data usable in Canada, Mexico, and over 215 international destinations.

But with this revamp, Google also changes a key alarm functionality, replacing its snooze and dismiss sliders with buttons. However, the option to use a slider may be returning soon.

    "body": "Credit: Pixel 10 Repair Manual TL;DR Google has filed a patent application describing a battery design that could make future devices easier to repair without compromising their thin builds, water resistance, or wireless charging capabilities. The idea replaces heavy use of glue with a reinforced battery assembly that locks into the device frame. While patents don’t always lead to real products, it’s good to see that Google is exploring more repair-friendly hardware designs. Google has filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) outlining a new way to design batteries inside phones and other devices so that they can be removed or replaced more easily and safely. The new battery design is even more impressive because it doesn’t sacrifice the slim, sealed build that modern, premium smartphones and tablets are known for.",

The new look also adds a Gemini sidebar that can suggest and analyze search term performance based on a broader topic. Google’s upgraded Trends Explore page is starting to roll out now for desktop users, but the gradual rollout could take weeks to reach everyone. Google Search data is paramount in determining what topics, people, and questions users find important . Google hosts a tool called Google Trends that anyone can use to discover the search queries and topics that are currently trending. It’s especially useful for researchers, content creators, and journalists, but there are a handful of ways the average Google user can tap into these metrics, too. Google announced today, January 14, that it is redesigning the Trends Explore page — and the new look adds a Gemini sidebar for the first time. The upgraded Trends Explore page uses Gemini to help users compare data across multiple related search terms. Instead of combing through similar search queries manually, users can have Gemini identify and compare topical trends. These are compiled automatically based on you…",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A new LockStar update introduces dynamic transition effects in One UI 8.5, replacing the standard static unlock. You get granular control over the animations, allowing you to tweak the speed, direction, distortion, and even the physics of the movement. You can also override the system’s auto-brightness for the Always On Display as part of the update. For all the power packed into our Galaxy phones, the act of unlocking them has felt pretty utilitarian for a while. You tap, the screen turns on, and that’s it. It works, but it’s not very exciting, except for the new fingerprint unlocking animations that arrived last year. If you’re using the latest One UI 8.5 beta, though, that quick moment is about to get a lot more interesting. Samsung has released a quiet update to its LockStar module. As per a post on X by tipster Ice Universe, the latest version (8.5.00.8) brings fully customizable unlock animations, meaning you now have several transition effects that make unlocking your phone feel smooth and intentional.",

The update isn’t out yet, and the existing version also appears half-baked, suggesting some wait time before it arrives for users. Remix is one of the most exciting features in Google Photos . You can recreate your existing images in different art styles or let Nano Banana transform them into entirely new ones with you in the spotlight. Google already offers a range of presets to let you quickly remix your images using templates, such as for professional headshots or a Christmas-themed scene. It is natural to expect that more templates will be added over time, which could make it difficult to arrange them. Thankfully, Google is experimenting with ways to sort Remix templates so they’re easy to access. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",
