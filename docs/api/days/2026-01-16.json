    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Netflix hasn’t said why it decided to end casting support, but a new report points to falling usage. One streaming exec says only about 10% of Android users still cast content. Casting still matters to some people, but Netflix no longer seems to see it as essential. Netflix still hasn’t explained why it removed casting from its mobile apps last month , but a new report offers a pretty convincing answer. It wasn’t going to ditch a popular feature, so the most likely reason is that not many people are using it anymore. This speculation is based on reporting from Janko Roettgers of Lowpass , published via The Verge , who suggests declining usage might be behind the move. Roettgers writes that a streaming service operator told him at CES that casting was once essential to their service, but only around 10% of Android users still cast today.",

Outside the museum, as a prelude, there is a mural created by artist Mr. Toledo showcasing the star at different moments in her career. Inside, visitors can view items selected by Suzette Quintanilla, Selena&#8217;s sister, including a microphone that still bears marks of her red lipstick, her personal cell phone, instruments from her band Los Dinos, and her Grammy awards — including the Lifetime Achievement Award she received posthumously in 2021 from the Recording Academy. Pieces of her unforgettable wardrobe, such as the white rhinestone dress by Lillie Rubin that Selena wore to the 1994 Grammy Awards, are part of the collection. Selena was a fashion icon for Latina women and designed many of her own outfits; some of her sketches are also on display.

At the beginning of 2025, Olivia Dean was still a mostly unfamiliar name to stateside pop fans. She&#8217;d seen some success in her U.K. home country with 2023 debut album Messy , but even there, the singer-songwriter was still more of a critical favorite than a proven hitmaker. But when 2025 hit, Dean turned it on early, and the next 12 months proved one long crescendo that has climaxed with her beginning the new year as one of the biggest artists in popular music, on either side of the pond.

It doesn’t look like much will change in both the base Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus compared to their predecessors — at least not enough to justify an upgrade. These will be the worst phones of 2026 on an expectation-to-reality scale; we all expect Samsung to do better. The lack of significant upgrades also makes waiting for the regular Galaxy S26 a huge waste of time, in my opinion. If you’re in the market for a new phone, now’s a good time to grab a Galaxy S25, not an S26. Here’s why.",

    "body": "Credit: MediaTek TL;DR MediaTek has announced new Dimensity 9500s and Dimensity 8500 chipsets. Despite their new names, the chipsets repackage designs from previous generations with minimal upgrades. The move appears inspired by Qualcomm’s recent launch of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. Over the years, MediaTek’s flagship Dimensity chips have improved enough to put up a tough fight against Qualcomm’s Elite mobile chips. The latest Dimensity 9500 proved to be too close to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in our testing. Now, just a few months after its release, MediaTek is launching a slightly less powerful variant, the Dimensity 9500s, likely geared towards affordable flagships. Along with it, MediaTek has also launched the Dimensity 8500, which might be geared towards the upper mid-range. Dimensity 9500 The Dimensity 9500s is built on TSMC’s N3E 3nm process, the same as the 9500, and maintains the same CPU architecture with “all big cores.” But instead of deploying Arm’s flagship and the newest C1 cores, the Dimensity 9500s uses older Cortex-X925 at 3.73GHz for the prime core, complemented by three Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Arm Cortex-A720 cores at undisclosed clock speeds.

The design features a unique trifold form with three separate displays, allowing a streamer to view chat, gameplay, and metrics simultaneously. While the bill of materials is ~$1,838, the total R&amp;D to bring it to life is estimated at a staggering $55 million. Imagine if a phone company really paid attention to its wildest customer ideas. That’s exactly what Nothing did. In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price. The video presents the project as a fun challenge rather than a product launch. And while you can’t buy this phone, the engineering behind it offers an interesting glimpse of what highly specialized smartphones could be like in the future.",

Seven months later, he still doesn’t have the Trump phone , a shipping date, or much clarity on what he actually paid a $100 deposit for. Now, that long-running mess may be about to draw federal scrutiny, after Democratic lawmakers asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Trump Mobile over alleged false advertising and deceptive practices.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Apple is working on end-to-end encryption for RCS in iOS 26.3 Beta 2. The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

The new price takes effect from your February billing date, with emails rolling out over the next month. The last price hike for US subscribers came in 2024. American Spotify users dodged the 2025 round of global price hikes , but that was always going to be a temporary reprieve. As sure as night follows day, Spotify is once again asking US subscribers to pay a little more for Premium. From your February billing date, the Individual Premium plan will increase from $11.99 per month to $12.99. Spotify confirmed the change in a Newsroom post , along with an example of the email landing in subscribers’ inboxes. The company frames the increase as a way to keep delivering “a great experience,” without pointing to any specific new features arriving alongside the higher price. Estonian and Latvian users will also see a price increase.",

Nintendo 3DS emulation has seen a major resurgence in interest with dual-screen gaming handhelds like the AYN Thor and Pocket DS coming out, but its best emulator hasn’t seen a new stable release in five months. Today, that streak ends, with Azahar Release 2124 dropping what its developers promise to be its “largest update ever.” One of the most significant changes for Android users is a simple default settings tweak, which yields a noticeable decrease in input latency. Previous versions had Vsync enabled by default as a way to reduce screen tearing in games. However, Android has its own frame pacing feature that performs a similar function. It has now been disabled by default, with the code around it cleaned up and consolidated.",

It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

Google’s Android team spent a significant chunk of 2025 overhauling various system apps with the more modern Material 3 Expressive UI. One of the apps that received a refresh was Google Clock , which introduced extensive changes, including prominent fonts, larger buttons, and more vibrant background colors. But with this revamp, Google also changes a key alarm functionality, replacing its snooze and dismiss sliders with buttons. However, the option to use a slider may be returning soon. Instead of just bringing the option back, Google may also revamp it by giving users the option to choose between the slider and the buttons.",

While patents don’t always lead to real products, it’s good to see that Google is exploring more repair-friendly hardware designs. Google has filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) outlining a new way to design batteries inside phones and other devices so that they can be removed or replaced more easily and safely. The new battery design is even more impressive because it doesn’t sacrifice the slim, sealed build that modern, premium smartphones and tablets are known for.",

A very public incident involving the Samsung Galaxy Ring saw a user sent to hospital after the ring swelled on his finger while he was about to board a flight. It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is testing a design upgrade for the Remix feature in the Photos app. With this refresh, Google Photos could sort templates into categories and help you choose the right one more quickly. The update isn’t out yet, and the existing version also appears half-baked, suggesting some wait time before it arrives for users. Remix is one of the most exciting features in Google Photos . You can recreate your existing images in different art styles or let Nano Banana transform them into entirely new ones with you in the spotlight. Google already offers a range of presets to let you quickly remix your images using templates, such as for professional headshots or a Christmas-themed scene. It is natural to expect that more templates will be added over time, which could make it difficult to arrange them. Thankfully, Google is experimenting with ways to sort Remix templates so they’re easy to access. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Google introduced Ask functionality in Google Photos in 2024, and the company recently replaced the app’s classic search tool with this AI-driven Ask feature.

Instead of the regular 25W charging, the base Galaxy S26 might support 45W charging. While the rumor had previously been refuted, it has resurfaced, making us wonder whether it’s actually true. The Galaxy S26 series has been one of the most confusing upcoming launches. We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is preparing a new battery-preserving feature that will limit frequent backups. We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",
