    "body": "The 2025 Steam Autumn Sale popped a couple months earlier than usual for the simple reason that in every previous year, it fell too damn close to the Steam Winter Sale. The two big seasonal sales were separated, literally, by just a couple weeks: The 2024 Autumn Sale wrapped up on December 4, and the Winter Sale kicked off on December 15. That's just too much sale all mush into one month. But if you thought that the shifted Autumn Sale meant no discounts on Steam in late November, boy, were you ever wrong. Because for the first time ever, Valve has capitulated to the gods of e-commerce and is holding its very own Black Friday Sale . Unlike many online retailers, who view Black Friday as one of the most important sell stuff holidays* of the year, Steam's Black Friday Sale is a relatively small affair compared to the seasonal heavyweights: It runs for just one week, and there are no attendant Points Shop freebies or trading cards to earn for hammering through your discovery queue. Which is not to say there aren't some sweet deals on offer, because there are. One obvious choice is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 , which is 60% off its regular price—that's $24/£22/€24, the lowest it'…",

As Tom Warren noted at The Verge , Microsoft did something similar earlier this year for Office, adding a feature called \"Startup Boost\" that loads parts of the Word application in the background so that it can launch more quickly. While I'm all for snappy software, I am a bit skeptical that either Word or the File Explorer should be such heavy applications that they need to be silently loading elements in the background before you click on them. Microsoft is also removing a lot of cruft from the File Explorer context menu, as shown in the image abov…",

Even after the tutorial, it's frustrating trying to actually win a match until you unlock the Scholar profession, which isn't made clear at all. To save you a lot of rematches, this guide explains how to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet by unlocking the Scholar profession, and goes through how Gift of the Gab actually works once you can play it without tears dripping onto your keyboard. How to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet Let's just get this out of the way first: You're not going to win any Gift of the Gab matches in Where Winds Meet until you complete the Legacy: Scholar's Path quest and unlock the Scholar profession . Despite the fancy concept of studying your opponent's words and picking the correct comeback cards to win, Gift of the Gab is really a stat-based minigame—which means it's only winnable once you have access to stat boosts, card upgrades, and craftable talismans as part of the Scholar skill tree.

Thankfully, it's not as complicated as it first seems, as you already have all you need to solve it with the third clue found during this quest. If you want to save some time studying the Chinese letters on the wall, you can find a quick solution to the Where Winds Meet wall puzzle below. Where Winds Meet wall puzzle solution To solve the wall puzzle, push these symobls in order: 漂, 百, and 移 .

When it finally burst from its coffin, the critical reaction ranged from mildly positive to firmly negative, with our own Fraser Brown giving it a respectable score of 78 in our Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 review. Yet whether players liked it or not, pretty much everyone agreed that The Chinese Room's sequel wasn't really a successor to Bloodlines at all, lacking the ridiculous roleplaying depth that makes Troika's original the brilliantly broken bloodsucking adventure it is. In fact, PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens pointed out that the biggest problem with Bloodlines 2 is that it is called Bloodlines 2 . As is so often the case, it appears Bloodlines 2's adoptive developers were highly aware of this potential problem. Speaking to Cat Burton of the Goth Boss Podcast (via PCGamesN ) TCR cofounder Dan Pinchbeck explained how he urged Paradox Interactive not to call Bloodlines 2, well, that .

Hashino also discussed how he's gearing up for what sounds like a literal upgrade to the JRPG genre, except there are no patch notes yet. As reported by 4gamer and translated by GamesRadar , Hashino sees the genre as three distinct eras—the past (JRPG 1.0), present (JRPG 2.0), and future (JRPG 3.0). The ' ghosts of JRPG past, present, and future ' would have switched up the story of A Christmas Carol a bit, and now I'm wondering what that looks like. According to Hashino, JRPG 1.0 encompasses the \"classics\", which is not a small number of enduring pioneers, including Final Fantasy—which continues to release entries to this day after more than 35 years—alongside Atlus' own Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series. JRPG 2.0 is the genre as it is now, the modern iteration with \"its current style, which feels higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player\"…",

In a chat with GamesRadar at this year's Golden Joystick Awards , English had one piece of advice for anyone looking to apply generative AI to games: \"Don't.\" Which is a pretty easy rule to follow, as rules go, but English does develop her thoughts a little further. \"I get it, that AI is a tool.

Lo was once involved in the research into mass production of chips at the Taiwanese chipmaking giant and spent over two decades at the company. As reported by Bloomberg , Intel denies claims that this hiring was made to take trade secrets from TSMC. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan told Bloomberg, \"It's rumor and speculation. There's nothing to it. We respect IP.\" TSMC isn't the only party looking to protect its IP. Kung Ming-hsin, the economy minister for Taiwan, reportedly said , “The Ministry of Economic Affairs will cooperate (with prosecutors) by explaining the current control mechanisms for Taiwan’s core technologies and by assessing whether there are any concerns related to the national security law.” As this is just being investigated, no formal charges or allegations have come forward just yet.

Even if you're using stamina to move faster, it's so slow and I feel so incredibly vulnerable when carrying a heavy item that, quite frankly, I try to avoid it as much as possible. In fact, I rarely do Field Depots at all, even though they can contain some good loot; it would take a lot of convincing to get me to haul those crates around. Well, after over 50 hours with the game, I've just learned that there's a method to carrying these boxes faster; I didn't think it was even possible to carry them 'wrong'.

Granted, setting up the emulation in the first place is not a simple task and requires some brain-busting tinkering, but it's becoming more and more worthwhile since this time last year, when Bloodborne was first playable , though with caveats and crashes galore . There are also comprehensive guides available to steer you through the process of setting up the emulator and patching the game. A new video from tabeneru showcases a side-by-side comparison between the previous and current version of ShadPS4 on a PC equipped with Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU at 1440p with the framerate unlocked. Bloodborne's performance is far more stable now, more than doubling its average fps in some instances—far and away from sub double-figure lows.

In a post on The Crew Unlimited's website (via RPS ), Crew curator whammy4 details what they describe as \"one of the most important updates we've ever released.\" Whammy4 explains that, not long after TCU's launch in September, the team realised that \"if your PC date is set to post June 2029 … The Crew stops working.\" Why anyone would have their PC's date set to beyond June 2029 is beyond me, so I'm not going to call the situation urgent , exactly. But the presence of such a bug will obviously become a much bigger problem in about three-and-a-half years' time. Naturally, The Crew's saviours were \"extremely concerned\" for the long-term health of the game, and investigated further: \"At first we were hoping that it was just a bug on the TCU Server's end,\" by which whammy4 means the server created by the TCU team to get the game r…",

I've praised Arc Raiders a lot since launch, perhaps above all else because it's finally an extraction shooter that's forgiving and welcoming for a wider audience, even as a fan of the genre's traditionally hardcore roots. However, there's a degree to which Arc Raiders' obsession with a fair playing field is its own worst enemy, and it unfortunately strikes deep into its core: the gear system just isn't all that exciting. The confusion I've seen from people wondering what they're supposed to do after they've unlocked everything and completed all the quests should have an easy answer: get better loot, kill things, eventually lose it, and do it all over again. But high-end loot isn't a satisfying and rewarding chase. Firstly, the abundance and strength of free loadouts mean there are a lot of players risking literally nothing in PvP match after match, while those bringing in gear have a high chance of losing it all.

Its creators revealed last month that the Unreal Engine-powered game would finally be released in November. True to their word, Rewind is available to download now. Rewind is a somewhat unusual fan project, a mixture of remake, compilation and spiritual successor to the first three TimeSplitters games. The website describes it as \"a greatest hits collection of maps, modes, leagues, challenges and story content across the original trilogy of TimeSplitters games.\" The end goal of the project is to include \"extensive content spanning the three games\". But this initial, early access release focuses on \"a subset of both existing content from the original games and some new content.\" This includes 28 maps, 91 characters, 41 weapons, and 10-player competitive multiplayer with 20 arcade game modes. \"Sorry it's taken so long. We've only been making the largest free content video game ever\", the website's front page bullishly declares. To coincide with the launch, the modders released a trailer showing Rewind in action. This also provides further clarification on what the early access version contains. S…",

The seemingly Xbox Series X/S-inspired UI, at least on the ROG Xbox Ally X, allows you to access a bunch of different game platforms to launch games, and it runs smoother and snappier than the regular Windows environment. As for how this translates to PC, according to Microsoft , if you have the update, you can enable it with Win + F11 and then hover over the Task View icon on your taskbar—or press Win + Tab to do the same—and select Xbox full screen experience to swap to it. In other words, it acts as another virtual desktop, which is how it works on the ROG Xbox Ally X, if memory of my brief hands-on experience serves me well. To get the…",

Kier appeared in over 200 films in the course of a long and remarkable career, and was perhaps best-known for his partnerships with Andy Warhol, Lars von Trier, and Werner Herzog.

So a varied career doesn't even begin to describe Kier's time on screens big and small, but to me he will always, first and foremost, be the utterly magnificent/absurd Yuri from Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge—a Transylvanian psychic who usurped control of the Soviet Union and launched an invasion of the United States, ultimately being defeated in Antarctica and imprisoned in a Psychic Isolation Chamber. Kier's unhinged performance helped define the games and is a big reason they continue to loom so large in the minds of fans.

But, I was a little dubious when the Zooseum DLC was announced—this could be its own game, no? It felt less exciting, and a shift away from what was unique about Two Point Museum—there's an abundance of Zoo-based management sims out there after all. As usual, I needn't have worried. The first look at its gameplay alleviated any concerns about it stepping away from its wonderfully absurd roots to become a facsimile of Zoo Tycoon, as tortoises waddle by with vegetable gardens on their back—complete with shed—and tropical birds look like exotic plants. If you felt short-changed by the lack of a specific museum for Fantasy Finds, Two Point Studios is rectifying this by going all out for its biggest DLC so far, including \"100% more lions\" and a new museum location: Silverbottom Park.

This card was announced as a celebration of the company's 30th anniversary of selling graphics cards, and it's now officially launched at a price of, er, $4,000 . To be fair, while that's over $1,000 more expensive than you can find some other RTX 5090 cards going for, and $2,000 more than the Founders Edition RTX 5090's MSRP, it is also $3,000 cheaper than the gold-plated RTX 5090 Dhahab OC, which started retailing for about $7,000 back in May . There are levels to these things, I suppose. The new card's price tag isn't just down to its dashing good looks, which it does admittedly have in spades, and it's not only to do with its limited supply of 1,000 cards. It's also down to its buffed 800 W power draw. Given the default RTX 5090 pretty much maxes out the 12V-2x6 connector's max wattage, a second power connection is needed to get it up to 800 W. That's where the BTF connection comes in.

Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, Nowakowski said \"There was a lot of inspiration in what Baldur's Gate 3 did, but I think we're still sticking to what was in Witcher 3, Cyberpunk. But we don't want to just make another game like that, just with better graphics. We do want to innovate.\" As for how, Nowakowski didn't have anything to reveal just yet. But he doubled down on the fact that it wouldn't resemble Divinity or Baldur's Gate: \"We definitely are not going to make a game like Larian did. \"That's the kind of game they can make.

My melon-pult flings a watermelon across the screen where it collides with a zombie, knocking its head off. That's the body of a dead person that's just been decapitated. And it happens every few seconds! My lawn would be covered in human heads if they didn't magically disappear. Grisly. Watching my plants get eaten by zombies is also disturbing. My poor, brave tall-nut, weeping yet still defiant as zombies rip fistfulls of nutmeat from its body and shove them into their rotting mouths. Even replacing my ragged t-nuts with new ones is a bit horrifying: I don't think I'm healing them, I think I'm euthanizing them in favor of new recruits. Monstrous. And what happens to single-use plants like squashes and ice-shrooms when they're activated? They sacrifice themselves? Dying for the cause? This game is non-stop carnage even when you win.

If you've ever played Wild Guns or even Duck Hunt, you'll be familiar with the gallery shooter: arcadey games where you shoot into the screen at enemies as they pop in and out of the background. Contra has had levels like this in the past, but in Neon Inferno, you're both run-and-gunning and gallery shooting simultaneously: hold down the right bumper, and you swap your aim between the background and foreground. You might think this would get chaotic, and it does. Very quickly in fact, even in the 10-minute demo on Steam. That said, Neon Inferno is more forgiving than you might expect from the genre.

Titled Jason’s Military Service, Slightly Analyzed , the post runs thousands of words and reads more like a military history essay than a standard fan theory. Drawing on decades of US Army lore, historical citations, and deep Rockstar sleuthing, the author argues that Jason may have once served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, one of America’s most elite light-infantry units. The evidence? A blink-and-you-miss-it tattoo visible on Jason’s left arm—a skull beneath a parachute, framed by the word \"Marauders\".

Sektori is a twin-stick developed by former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen, most easily described as a roguelike take on Geometry Wars. Yes, it's another game that borrows that three-card upgrade system from Vampire Survivors and slaps it into a familiar experience, but not only does this work extremely well, it's also only a fraction of what makes Sektori great. I wrote a little about Sektori a while back, but at that point I'd only played the demo. I took an early copy on holiday with me a couple of weeks back, planning to check it out among a bunch of other games. Instead, I just played Sektori. For 40 hours.

Consequently, Fatshark has taken an interesting approach to celebrating a decade of rat-squashing, bringing one of Vermintide's \"most popular\" maps into Vermintide 2. Yet Return to the Reik isn't a straight port of Vermintide's distinctive River Reik, as Fatshark hints in a Steam post that \"Things are not as before\". River Reik was introduced in Vermintide's \"Death on the Reik\" DLC released in 2017. The DLC only has a 'Mostly Positive' Steam rating, which would seem to contrast with Fatshark's claims about its popularity. As mentioned, however, Return to the Reik isn't a straight rerun of the map. Fatshark says the new version brings \"expanded, boat-focussed gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and centre\".

But with the release of the Free Ride update, that's all changed. Well, slightly changed. Free Ride replaces Explore mode completely, offering a similarly open-ended experience while fleshing it out with actual stuff to do. Whether or not this stuff is worth doing is another question, but at the very least it's an improvement over nothing. Primarily, Free Ride introduces two new activity types—the old videogame staples of racing and combat. Races come in both car and horse varieties, though vehicles get substantially more love than their equine counterparts.

At the same time TCGs are still competing for attention with the last decade's huge growth in the resurgent board game, miniatures wargame, and roleplaying game communities. They're also sharing space with digital card games, which give many people the strategic experience of playing a TCG without the social one. But Magic's still a juggernaut, with only two long-term competitors really sticking around: The Pokémon TCG and Yu-Gi-Oh, neither of which are actual threats to Magic's throne. In Pokémon's case simply because its audience is by necessity either younger or—in many cases—simply speculatively collecting rather than properly playing.

The highlight so far is Lip Motion Fix , a mod that is available for both New Vegas and Fallout 3 since it deals with a consistent issue in both games. As modder Asterra highlights in a before-and-after video, lip sync is broken in both games in the exact same ways. The dialogue generation system gets a bunch of things wrong, defaulting to a closed mouth when a character should be pronouncing the \"ee\" sound at the end of \"modesty\" for instance, or treating \"town\" as if it's pronounced \"tone\". It also has trouble with elements of the script like dashes and voice actor guidance given in brackets, and plenty of other things besides.

Unlike the souls which have to be shot, these can't be denied by the enemy team and will appear translucent to them.

Off the top of my head, I can't think of a game that comes close to the same feeling and masterful execution of the mechanic besides Insomniac's Spidey sequel.

Valve's legendary narrative shooter was no exception, as former Valve developer Tom Forsyth shared in a thread on Mastodon . In the thread, Forsyth discusses a bug he encountered while working on a VR version of Half-Life 2, back in 2013 when Valve was considering where it wanted to go with the technology. HL2 was one of the easiest translations to VR in Valve's back catalog—it was a relatively recent release, and the \"tricks with perspective\" in Portal \"were of course a nauseating disaster.\" The problem was, this new VR build softlocked the player mere minutes into the game. In the opening scene , when a metro cop is meant to usher the player through a door, the door wouldn't open in the VR build for reasons that weren't clear, freezing the player in place to wait for a necessary story event that never comes. \"Oh dear,\" Tom Forsyth recalled in his thread. \"We can't ship this. I get some other folks, including some folks who worked on HL2 originally, and yep—it's broken. And it's broken when y…",

And despite not being in a fully-finished state yet, even after a decade? I can tell those 11 years of labour were done out of love. I hesitate to use the word \"cosy\" to describe a game, given how that only really describes a vague aesthetic, but I struggle to find another word that fits Tavern Keeper, here. It has a goofy, polygonal artstyle, its UI is overflowing with kitschy little details, and its story books—more on those in a moment—are narrated by Steven Pacey, a seasoned audiobook narrator with a library under his belt. Playing Tavern Keeper is like stepping into a warm bath or wrapping yourself up in a heated blanket. It is, perhaps fittingly, what I imagine a Hobbit feels like while tucked into their favourite hidey-hole with a good book. It is an unrelentingly lovely experience, despite the barely-contained managerial chaos you'll be trying to channel during your playthroughs. Despite its comf…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Having the best guns in Arc Raiders is helpful and all, but I'd say knowing your surroundings is actually more important to your success. Can you quickly retreat to a safe location without having to check your map and waste precious seconds? Do you know where locked rooms are? Where's the best place to ambush roaming raiders? How the hell do you reach the extraction on Stella Montis? I'm still figuring out that last part. Nevertheless, that's what our quiz below is all about: I'm going to show you various named locations across Arc Raiders' five maps, and all you need to do is enter the correct name. And that's the official in-game name, not any shorthand versions. For simplicity's sake, I'm only going to use named locations marked on your map . While some are outside, none are in random parts of the map.
