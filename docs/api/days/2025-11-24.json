The seemingly Xbox Series X/S-inspired UI, at least on the ROG Xbox Ally X, allows you to access a bunch of different game platforms to launch games, and it runs smoother and snappier than the regular Windows environment. As for how this translates to PC, according to Microsoft , if you have the update, you can enable it with Win + F11 and then hover over the Task View icon on your taskbar—or press Win + Tab to do the same—and select Xbox full screen experience to swap to it. In other words, it acts as another virtual desktop, which is how it works on the ROG Xbox Ally X, if memory of my brief hands-on experience serves me well. To get the…",

Kier appeared in over 200 films in the course of a long and remarkable career, and was perhaps best-known for his partnerships with Andy Warhol, Lars von Trier, and Werner Herzog. Though he also found time to appear in music videos for Madonna, Gwen Stefani, Korn, and others. So a varied career doesn't even begin to describe Kier's time on screens big and small, but to me he will always, first and foremost, be the utterly magnificent/absurd Yuri from Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge—a Transylvanian psychic who usurped control of the Soviet Union and launched an invasion of the United States, ultimately being defeated in Antarctica and imprisoned in a Psychic Isolation Chamber. Kier's unhinged performance helped define the games and is a big reason they continue to loom so large in the minds of fans.

    "body": "So far we've been thoroughly spoiled in Two Point Museum , treated with an abundance of free updates—from staff memorials to the ever-expanding Digiverse expedition map—and its first major paid DLC Fantasy Finds . Having recently completed Fantasy Finds, I was impressed at the sheer breadth of content and the incorporation of light RPG mechanics that let me live my best Baldur's Gate life in a museum. But, I was a little dubious when the Zooseum DLC was announced—this could be its own game, no? It felt less exciting, and a shift away from what was unique about Two Point Museum—there's an abundance of Zoo-based management sims out there after all. As usual, I needn't have worried. The first look at its gameplay alleviated any concerns about it stepping away from its wonderfully absurd roots to become a facsimile of Zoo Tycoon, as tortoises waddle by with vegetable gardens on their back—complete with shed—and tropical birds look like exotic plants. If you felt short-changed by the lack of a specific museum for Fantasy Finds, Two Point Studios is rectifying this by going all out for its biggest DLC so far, including \"100% more lions\" and a new museum location: Silverbottom Park.

    "body": "Earlier in the year, I got a look at what I called the ideal GPU physique in the form of the Asus ROG Matrix GeForce RTX 5090. This card was announced as a celebration of the company's 30th anniversary of selling graphics cards, and it's now officially launched at a price of, er, $4,000 . To be fair, while that's over $1,000 more expensive than you can find some other RTX 5090 cards going for, and $2,000 more than the Founders Edition RTX 5090's MSRP, it is also $3,000 cheaper than the gold-plated RTX 5090 Dhahab OC, which started retailing for about $7,000 back in May . There are levels to these things, I suppose. The new card's price tag isn't just down to its dashing good looks, which it does admittedly have in spades, and it's not only to do with its limited supply of 1,000 cards. It's also down to its buffed 800 W power draw. Given the default RTX 5090 pretty much maxes out the 12V-2x6 connector's max wattage, a second power connection is needed to get it up to 800 W. That's where the BTF connection comes in. To get this special edition GPU hooked up to all the juice that its cooling and VBIOS is designed to make use of, you'll need an \"Advanced BTF motherboard\" in addition t…",

On the plus side, though, this quest doesn't require you to extract anything, so you can bring a free loadout . On the whole, it's a pretty straightforward quest all centered in and around Red Tower, so here's how to complete it and overcome those trickier stages, like finding the missing battery cell and the antenna terminal. Find the missing battery cell and power up the generator The battery is located in a box to the northeast of Red Tower (Image credit: Embark Studios) First off, you'll need to head to the Red Tower location in the south of the Buried City, where you'll then be asked to \"Find the missing battery cell\".

    "body": "طالب واين روني، نجم مانشستر يونايتد السابق، آرني سلوت، مدرب ليفربول، باستبعاد النجم المصري محمد صلاح من التشكيلة الأساسية، في محاولة لإعادة الفريق إلى الانتصارات. وجاءت تصريحات روني بعد خسارة ليفربول الثقيلة بنتيجة 3-0 على أرضه أمام نوتنجهام فورست يوم السبت، والتي جعلت حامل اللقب الحالي يتراجع إلى المركز الحادي عشر في جدول ترتيب الدوري الإنجليزي الممتاز، بفارق 11 نقطة عن المتصدر آرسنال. ولم يتمكن صلاح من تسجيل أي هدف أو تقديم أي تمريرة حاسمة خلال المباراة، والتي شكلت الهزيمة السادسة لليفربول في آخر سبع مواجهات بالدوري الإنجليزي الممتاز. وبعد خسارته أمام مانشستر سيتي في الجولة السابقة، استقبل الفريق 6 أهداف دون رد في آخر مباراتين بالدوري. وقال روني، عبر برنامجه \"The Wayne Rooney Show\": \"صلاح لا يساعد الفريق على المستوى الدفاعي. أنا متأكد أنه إذا كنت أحد اللاعبين الذين تم التعاقد معهم ورأيت زملاءك لا يجتهدون في العودة للوراء، فماذا سيكون شعورك؟ أعلم أنه أسطورة النادي وكل ما قدمه للفريق، لكن إذا كنت جالساً على دكة البدلاء، فما الرسالة التي يرسلها لك إذا رأيت أحد اللاعبين لا يجري خلف الكرة وهو يشارك في كل مباراة؟\". وأضاف: \"لو كنت مكان سلووت كنت سأقدم على قرار كبير ليترك أثرًا على بقية الفريق.. عندما لا تفوز بالمباريات، عليك أن تحافظ على الانضباط وتكون صعب الإيقاف\". وتابع: \"أعتقد أنهم …",

But while the game's success was \"an inspiration\" according to CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski, it's not necessarily the direction development division CD Projekt Red (CDPR)'s games are headed. Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, Nowakowski said \"There was a lot of inspiration in what Baldur's Gate 3 did, but I think we're still sticking to what was in Witcher 3, Cyberpunk. But we don't want to just make another game like that, just with better graphics. We do want to innovate.\" As for how, Nowakowski didn't have anything to reveal just yet. But he doubled down on the fact that it wouldn't resemble Divinity or Baldur's Gate: \"We definitely are not going to make a game like Larian did. \"That's the kind of game they can make. But a lot of stuff with how they can interact with the world and what it does was, for sure, some inspiration to us.\" Of course, CDPR has taken The Witcher in new directions before with spinoffs like Gwent and Thronebreak…",

My melon-pult flings a watermelon across the screen where it collides with a zombie, knocking its head off. That's the body of a dead person that's just been decapitated. And it happens every few seconds! My lawn would be covered in human heads if they didn't magically disappear. Grisly. Watching my plants get eaten by zombies is also disturbing. My poor, brave tall-nut, weeping yet still defiant as zombies rip fistfulls of nutmeat from its body and shove them into their rotting mouths. Even replacing my ragged t-nuts with new ones is a bit horrifying: I don't think I'm healing them, I think I'm euthanizing them in favor of new recruits. Monstrous. And what happens to single-use plants like squashes and ice-shrooms when they're activated? They sacrifice themselves? Dying for the cause? This game is non-stop carnage even when you win.

Contra-style platforming is just one dimension on offer here. If you've ever played Wild Guns or even Duck Hunt, you'll be familiar with the gallery shooter: arcadey games where you shoot into the screen at enemies as they pop in and out of the background. Contra has had levels like this in the past, but in Neon Inferno, you're both run-and-gunning and gallery shooting simultaneously: hold down the right bumper, and you swap your aim between the background and foreground. You might think this would get chaotic, and it does. Very quickly in fact, even in the 10-minute demo on Steam. That said, Neon Inferno is more forgiving than you might expect from the genre.

Titled Jason’s Military Service, Slightly Analyzed , the post runs thousands of words and reads more like a military history essay than a standard fan theory. Drawing on decades of US Army lore, historical citations, and deep Rockstar sleuthing, the author argues that Jason may have once served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, one of America’s most elite light-infantry units. The evidence? A blink-and-you-miss-it tattoo visible on Jason’s left arm—a skull beneath a parachute, framed by the word \"Marauders\".

Yes, it's another game that borrows that three-card upgrade system from Vampire Survivors and slaps it into a familiar experience, but not only does this work extremely well, it's also only a fraction of what makes Sektori great. I wrote a little about Sektori a while back, but at that point I'd only played the demo. I took an early copy on holiday with me a couple of weeks back, planning to check it out among a bunch of other games. Instead, I just played Sektori. For 40 hours.

The original Vermintide was a decent stab at Left 4 Dead -style cooperative action by developer Fatshark, but much like Valve's pioneering shooter, it has long been eclipsed by its superior sequel. Consequently, Fatshark has taken an interesting approach to celebrating a decade of rat-squashing, bringing one of Vermintide's \"most popular\" maps into Vermintide 2. Yet Return to the Reik isn't a straight port of Vermintide's distinctive River Reik, as Fatshark hints in a Steam post that \"Things are not as before\". River Reik was introduced in Vermintide's \"Death on the Reik\" DLC released in 2017. The DLC only has a 'Mostly Positive' Steam rating, which would seem to contrast with Fatshark's claims about its popularity. As mentioned, however, Return to the Reik isn't a straight rerun of the map. Fatshark says the new version brings \"expanded, boat-focussed gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and centre\". There's also \"more than Just Skaven\" lurking in the surrounding woods—suggesting you'll encounter some Chaos horde…",

But with the release of the Free Ride update, that's all changed. Well, slightly changed. Free Ride replaces Explore mode completely, offering a similarly open-ended experience while fleshing it out with actual stuff to do. Whether or not this stuff is worth doing is another question, but at the very least it's an improvement over nothing. Primarily, Free Ride introduces two new activity types—the old videogame staples of racing and combat. Races come in both car and horse varieties, though vehicles get substantially more love than their equine counterparts. Petrolheads can participate in three lap-based circuit races, three linear road sprints, and six time trials.

The highlight so far is Lip Motion Fix , a mod that is available for both New Vegas and Fallout 3 since it deals with a consistent issue in both games. As modder Asterra highlights in a before-and-after video, lip sync is broken in both games in the exact same ways. The dialogue generation system gets a bunch of things wrong, defaulting to a closed mouth when a character should be pronouncing the \"ee\" sound at the end of \"modesty\" for instance, or treating \"town\" as if it's pronounced \"tone\". It also has trouble with elements of the script like dashes and voice actor guidance given in brackets, and plenty of other things besides.

In the past, you immediately got half the souls (split with nearby allies) when a trooper died and had to shoot the other half out of the air as it floated from the corpse. Now, the first half of the income also has to be manually secured—it will fall to the ground, and you'll have to walk within a short radius of the souls to claim them. Unlike the souls which have to be shot, these can't be denied by the enemy team and will appear translucent to them. Still, it will certainly lead to more fights breaking out in the laning phase; heroes that prefer to stay back and farm from afar will have to get closer to the action so they can snag those precious souls.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 first swung onto PS5 consoles towards the end of 2023, and breached the shores of Steam at the beginning of this year. Grand Theft Auto 5, on the other hand, followed the same two-year console-to-desktop pilgrimage a full decade earlier. (Image credit: Rockstar) That first time switching between Michael or Franklin or Trevor was a wonderful feeling, as the camera moved skyward, birds-eye-view and in slow-motion, before darting in a different direction across the map and landing back at ground level; you now in control of someone else altogether. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a game that comes close to the same feeling and masterful execution of the mechanic besides Insomniac's Spidey sequel. Back in 2013, it was a watershed moment for the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole. Not only was it cool, it was the first time we were able to guide different playable protagonists through missions and swap paths on the fly—something that lent itself well to GTA 5's often open-end…",

Valve's legendary narrative shooter was no exception, as former Valve developer Tom Forsyth shared in a thread on Mastodon . In the thread, Forsyth discusses a bug he encountered while working on a VR version of Half-Life 2, back in 2013 when Valve was considering where it wanted to go with the technology. HL2 was one of the easiest translations to VR in Valve's back catalog—it was a relatively recent release, and the \"tricks with perspective\" in Portal \"were of course a nauseating disaster.\" The problem was, this new VR build softlocked the player mere minutes into the game. In the opening scene , when a metro cop is meant to usher the player through a door, the door wouldn't open in the VR build for reasons that weren't clear, freezing the player in place to wait for a necessary story event that never comes. \"Oh dear,\" Tom Forsyth recalled in his thread. \"We can't ship this.

    "body": "Tavern Keeper's a game with a bit of a history—taking Greenheart Games a whopping 11 years to make , it finally released into Early Access earlier this month after a series of solid, but limited demos, expanding the scope of what we could mess around with from one tavern to three. And despite not being in a fully-finished state yet, even after a decade? I can tell those 11 years of labour were done out of love. I hesitate to use the word \"cosy\" to describe a game, given how that only really describes a vague aesthetic, but I struggle to find another word that fits Tavern Keeper, here. It has a goofy, polygonal artstyle, its UI is overflowing with kitschy little details, and its story books—more on those in a moment—are narrated by Steven Pacey, a seasoned audiobook narrator with a library under his belt. Playing Tavern Keeper is like stepping into a warm bath or wrapping yourself up in a heated blanket. It is, perhaps fittingly, what I imagine a Hobbit feels like while tucked into their favourite hidey-hole with a good book. It is an unrelentingly lovely experience, despite the barely-contained managerial chaos you'll be trying to channel during your playthroughs. Despite its comf…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Having the best guns in Arc Raiders is helpful and all, but I'd say knowing your surroundings is actually more important to your success. Can you quickly retreat to a safe location without having to check your map and waste precious seconds? Do you know where locked rooms are? Where's the best place to ambush roaming raiders? How the hell do you reach the extraction on Stella Montis? I'm still figuring out that last part. Nevertheless, that's what our quiz below is all about: I'm going to show you various named locations across Arc Raiders' five maps, and all you need to do is enter the correct name. And that's the official in-game name, not any shorthand versions. For simplicity's sake, I'm only going to use named locations marked on your map . While some are outside, none are in random parts of the map.

The newly released bike patch actually adds bicycles and electric scooters into Skylines 2, along with all the infrastructural gubbins that go along with a bicycle-friendly city. By default, your bike-loving citizens will cycle along the standard road network with cars and trucks. But you can create specific bicycle paths and bicycle road lanes to separate cars from cyclists—which is safer and healthier for everyone. Since cyclists also need a place to park their bikes when they reach their destination, the update also adds numerous types of bike parks. Just as adding more car parks encourages drivers not to park on the street, bike parks will encourage more citizens to cycle around the city rather than drive. But the bike patch adds considerably more, such as several new types of park. This includes a bike park that is also, wait for it, a bike park. What I mean by that is it's a place to park your bike that is also a bike park. Sorry, that still isn't clear enoug…",

True, there are plenty of third-party options for voice-chat these days. But sorting that out can be a pain in the arse, especially when you're playing across multiple platforms. Better, if you're making a dedicated cooperative experience, to ensure voice chat is integrated into that. It took five months, but Firebreak has finally done this. In a Steam post Remedy announced that it has added \"cross-platform voice chat\" into all versions, letting you finally gab with your pals in the Oldest House without migrating to Discord. Sadly, it isn't all good news on the Firebreak front. In the same post, Remedy also explained that Firebreak's next major update, Rogue Protocol, has been delayed into 2026. Remedy originally planned to release this alongside voice chat, but explains the mode needs \"a bit more time\" in the oven. This is because Rogue Proto…",

But it seems id Software has had a rethink about the Ripatorium, as The Dark Ages' latest update substantially overhauls how it works. While update 2.3 is mainly Ripatorium focussed, it's worth briefly going over the adjustments it makes to the campaign and general play. Regarding the former, the update introduces another round of combat encounter tweaks, adding an enemy here, removing another there. On the latter front, it adds an option to adjust TDA's \"Brink of Death\" feature, which determines how likely you are to survive a near-death situation. Basically, you can now reduce the system's impact on combat, making you more likely to die at low-health. Onto the main event, update 2.3 introduces \"Ripatorium 2.0\", which chiefly converts The Dark Ages' arena mode from a purely wave-based affair to a more structured round-based format. Previously, players only had broad control over an encounter, able to select enemies they wanted to fight, dictate number of times enemies would respawn and choose whether or not to set a time limit or to s…",

This drive for efficiency is felt across the whole of Black Ops 7, but nowhere more so than the campaign, a grinding slog through the forthcoming Warzone map update and the occasional multiplayer map retooled for wave defense against mindless AI hordes.

And by lying, well, what I really mean is rendering video somewhere other than inside the actual window that was open on your desktop—sort of a parallel plane of existence to the desktop you were actually looking at—before sneakily porting it over. If you've watched a single Twitch stream or Marvel movie in the past 15 years, you're probably all too familiar with the concept of a green screen, a bright, single-color surface that makes it easy to blank out a background and fill it in with something else. A Hawaiian beach, a bunch of CGI superheroes punching each other, etc. The more accurate color-agnostic term for the technique is chroma-keying, which is actually how Windows rendered all of its video back in the old days. \"The media player program didn't render the video pixels to the screen,\" longtime Microsoft developer Raymond Chen wrote recently in a blog post . Instead, Windows would render a green screen (or a different color, depending on the version), then \"render the video pixels to a graphics surface shared with the graphics card.\" The fina…",

The search has been going so poorly that I put rusted gears on the backburner while I focused on quests, convinced that pretending I don't care about rust nor gears would magically conjure them in the next dusty toolbox I opened.

So I went topside to check it out myself. The spot in the video is the North Elevator of Dam Battlegrounds , a place that I've visited at least a hundred times before, but never picked apart for loot.

Instead of adding to your arsenal, level ups allow you to add more buildings, from towers to farmland to factories, all feeding into your defence. If your hero dies, you simply place a grave in your city and spawn a new one—but if your city takes too many hits, it crumbles, and the run is over. So guarding your home as it trundles along is vital… but you're also encouraged to risk breaking away to explore.

    "body": "We learned in 2023 that PUBG was being fitted for an extraction shooter spinoff, referred to at the time as Project Black Budget . It was set to launch in the second half of 2024, but then 2024 came, Project Black Budget didn't, and frankly we forgot about the whole thing. I did, anyway. Now, as the second half of 2025 withers away, it's back, officially known as PUBG: Black Budget and with a closed alpha test set to begin in December. Developed by PUBG Studios, Black Budget is a PvPvE shooter set on a remote island that's trapped in a time loop and also being consumed by a supernatural phenomenon called—wait for it—the Anomaly. Okay, no points for originality there, but the game also promises \"a focus on exploration and discovery rather than pure survival and combat,\" which I do find interesting. I've really been enjoying Arc Raiders lately, primarily because it's proven a far more cooperative experience than it appears at first blush, so an extraction shooter that leans into that side of the gameplay, as opposed to just shooting the hell out of everything, is one I want to know more about. This test will be available exclusive on PC via Steam , and is open to players in North Am…",

I mean, come on, the setting is perfect, you can't return to Raccoon City and not find that floppy-haired dreamboat creeping around somewhere. The theories got so huge that Capcom even had to go as far as to say that Leon Kennedy is absolutely not the protagonist of the next series, as he's just too cool to be scared by monsters any more. But they never conclusively said Leon wouldn't show up as a se…",

We've had plenty of patch notes and changes to this end. Treyarch has even changed the requirements for players to get into Endgame , opening it up to everyone. But now Matt Scronce, design director at Treyarch, has decided to go through some of the big changes in a dev diary, starting with aim assist. (Image credit: Activision) \"Aim assist is a big conversation and we have been closely monitoring that conversation, and of course, looking at our internal data, we're fairly happy with where we're at,\" Scronce says. \"But we will be making some very nuanced changes and slightly increasing aim assist's strength over range ahead of Season 1.\" The goal is apparently \"to create a more balanced and competitive experience\" by increasing the range of rotational aim assist. Although this comes with a new requirement: a player's right stick movement has to track an enemy for rotational aim assist to activate at its full strength. Which may work to balance out the aim assist strength buff,…",
