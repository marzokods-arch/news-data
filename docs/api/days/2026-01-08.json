However, while DF's patch notes often skew towards absurdist comedy, update 53.09 features a bugfix that's raw tragedy: \"Mothers no longer seek ghostly babies.\" Sorry, baby shoes. We found a sadder six-word story. (Image credit: Kitfox Games) For the uninitiated, properly attending to your settlement's dead is one of the many obligations the Dwarf Fortress player has to manage. When a dwarf succumbs to one of DF's countless hazards, you don't just suffer the loss of a worker and the emotional toll that's dealt to their grieving loved ones. If a dead dwarf isn't adequately entombed or memorialized, there's a chance that their restless spirit will return to haunt the fortress, further tormenting those who've outlasted them. And if your fortress has suffered a …",

Renewed five years previously on January 5, 2021, Logitech will have to stay vigilant at the start of 2031 to catch the same mistake. Notably, this problem actually led to the resurgence of a two-year-old support Reddit thread of users teaching others how to get out of an Options+ boot loop. This thread was updated, with the original poster saying, \"To anyone who is getting this Jan 6th, 2026 issue, the solution I found here 2 years ago will not work\". This thread continues to say: \"It's embarrassing that they [Logitech] continue to have these long-standing issues while they continue to iterate on with their later mouse releases.

While it'd be hard to think of a Fallout game without VATS underlying it, linking gunplay to the classic RPG elements of its predecessors, Fallout 3—the first Fallout game after Bethesda acquired the licence—almost threw the gunplay out with the… uh, gunwater. I've lost track of this metaphor. That's per an interview in the latest issue of Edge (thanks, Gamesradar ). Speaking to lead artist Istvan Pely, it was revealed that \"there were some significant challenges figuring out VATS. There was a long period where it was like, 'Is this even fun? Is this worth doing at all?

After rummaging through upcoming releases on Steam, I've immediately fallen in love with Rewind 99, the latest in the line of retail sims, which launches into early access in March 2026. It's got something no other retail sim has: pizzazz (it's set in the 90s). Your job is simple: you must turn around the last remaining video rental store and make it profitable in the face of a new challenger, RentNet—a digital streaming service that's well before its time.

However, Panther Lake's official launch at CES has given both Intel and AMD ample room to take potshots at each other. Talking to Tom's Hardware , AMD SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, spoke about Panther Lake. Tikoo said \"Strix Halo or Ryzen AI Max will kill it\" and that \"it's not even a fair fight at that point.\" He added that AMD's top-end chips are \"better than that in terms of graphics performance\" and that those looking for gaming will be buying gaming-specific chips anyway. In terms of performance, Tikoo points out Intel's benchmark results for Panther Lake were compared to lower-end and older Ryzen chips: \"They compared their highest-end to our midpoint.\" Earlier this week, Intel reported that its Core Ultra Series 3 Panther Lake chips are up to 77% faster in regard to gaming performance than Lunar Lake.

There is a bit more nuance to be gleaned beyond that eye-watering figure, though. To begin with, Samsung's full earnings guidance offers the estimated range of \"19.9 trillion to 20.1 trillion Korean won\" for operating profits and \"92 trillion to 94 trillion Korean won\" for sales. Yeah, okay, that is still a lot of won. The guidance goes on to note that only offering ranges doesn't square with Korean disclosure regulations, hence the '20 trillion Korean won' figure.

And if that chair is comfortable and adjustable, then all the better. PC gaming is unique among all the different kinds of interactive entertainment (with the exception of building an arcade in your garage, barn or other outbuilding) in the way its core demographic requires actual furniture to do it, and that's why PC Gamer maintains a list of the best gaming chairs . AndaSeat's Kaiser 3E XL comes in at a lower price than Secretlab's Titan Evo XL, and if you are less than 5' 11” (180 cm) tall you can save a further sliver of cash by getting the merely ‘large' version. The overall look of the chair—with its striking cutouts and a logo-emblazoned backrest that wishes it could appear on camera illuminated by some streamer's ringlight—is definitely gamer-centric. And definitely more so than the modern office style embraced by the Herman Miller/Logitech partnership or even Ikea .

Question, will that tech appear in a PC monitor any time soon? The answer is yes and no. Yes, the technologies seen in the new panels are headed for PC monitors. But, no, you can't expect to see PC monitors anything like that bright. One useful reference point here is that existing TV OLED panels are already rated at up 4,000 nits, with these new-gen OLEDs bumping that up to 4,500 nits. Existing OLED monitors, meanwhile, get nowhere 4,000 nits, typically topping out at 1,300 nits. So, OLED monitors based on a given equivalent generation of panel technology are much less bright on the desktop than their TV compatriots. We'll come back to the reasons why, but let's just cover off what the two big panel makers announced at CES this year. Samsung's latest QD-OLED panels aren't a radical departure. The emissive material is revised rather than a fully new generation. All told, Samsung is claiming 4,500 nits peak HDR brightness for small screen areas with 450 nits full-screen brightness. That is dramatically higher than its …",

Now the main excitement is out of the way, though, we can get back to the really bitter pricing stuff, lovely. Stuff, in case you missed it, such as Asus saying it's going to hike its prices.

In a post to the official Minecraft news blog , it was revealed that baby mobs will be getting an entirely new appearance. Prior to this drop, all baby mobs were just downsized versions of the fully grown model, with massive heads. Now though, this new look gives them single pixelated eyes and, depending on the mob, an entirely new model, like the little yellow blocky chick rather than a small chicken. According to game director Agnes Larsson, Minecraft's artists have given each mob \"unique textures and models that give each baby mob their own adorable look and identity.\" This applies to all passive mobs which you can breed in the overworld too, like ocelots, all 11 kitten versions, rabbits, all your standard farm animals, and wolf pups. These re-designs follow the biome-specific variants of mobs following the Spring to Life drop release…",

    "body": "Arc Raiders was one of last year's nicest surprises, a chilled PvEvP extraction shooter that's constantly surprising, challenging, and… well, OK, it's got one problem for me. It's on the crafting and upgrades side. I hate inventory management and Arc Raiders is particularly bad at it: You're constantly bottlenecked on upgrades by a shortage of some items, while at the same time having an overabundance of other things you may or may not need later. Yes, it's deliberate and by design. But other extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov, despite being on a different level of brutality than Arc Raiders, at least have a player economy where you can fudge through some of the worst by selling and buying. Despite Arc Raiders being quite happy to connect players in-game, there's no means to swap or sell key items in order to get the stuff you really need. I think that, within reason, it's a problem the game should seek to address—and it seems to me that every player would be all-in on it. Anyway, in an interview with Games Beat , Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund talked about player to player trading and the news is that, basically, it will be coming.

I'm creeping through sand-swept streets at night as gunshots ring out in the distance and flares start flying, then all of a sudden a Rocketeer starts hounding me in and out of houses, and I narrowly escape down a subway. It's impressive, especially for a multiplayer game. Some creative players took advantage of this and traded guns for binoculars, making incredible on-field reporting and even short films , all recorded inside the game—no CGI or greenscreen required. I suppose it was only a matter of time, then, until Hollywood tried to capitalise on Arc Raiders' sudden success. As Embark Studios' CEO Patrick Söderlund explains in a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi, the team has already received offers to adapt gaming's latest hit to the big screen, even though it's barely even two months old at this point. \"I can't tell you how many companies have reached out to us wanting to make a TV series or movie out of this IP\", Söderlund says, without naming any names.

It's certainly represented a major change in the way the tech industry promotes new systems, and thanks to NPUs cropping up in many of the latest chips, the number of AI PCs has risen dramatically. According to Intel fellow Tom Peterson, its figures are now 'slightly north' of 100 million. \"We have shipped 100 million [AI PCs] already\" said Petersen, at an Intel briefing I attended earlier today. \"We've been doing this now for a couple of years, started off with Meteor Lake, and now Lunar Lake.

Petersen continued: \"Our installed base of TOPS should no longer be referred to as TOPS. It's what I'm going to call a ZOP.

The idea is, you get a virtual 177-inch monitor beamed in front of your eyeballs via a Micro-OLED display within the glasses, covering 95% of your vision with a 57-degree field of view of excellent gaming fidelity. Why have a massive screen on your wall, when you can have a tiny one that creates the same effect in a wearable form factor ? Mmm. We'll get on to that in a minute, because I've got some ergonomic issues to discuss first. For a start, there's a substantial cable attached to the rear of the left arm, which makes putting them on a very awkward event. I did it in public and nearly poked myself in the eye, as the glasses seem destined to fall in on themselves as you bring them towards your face. Secondly, they made me look like a dork.

However, as I'm on the ground at CES 2026, Intel gave me a chance earlier today to put the Arc B390 iGPU through its paces in a brief benchmarking session. I have to say, its performance was pretty impressive—for an integrated graphics solution, at the very least. Due to my packed CES schedule (my fault entirely), I had less than an hour to quickly run some benchmarks and futz around in the odd game. Still, I'm enough of an old hand to know exactly what game I was benching first— Cyberpunk 2077 , of course. My test laptop was a non-descript Lenovo machine with an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H onboard, the top-end Panther Lake CPU from the new lineup. Still, the lack of discrete graphics hardware means I didn't subject the poor lappy to path tracing, or even ultra settings, at least at first. No, this is an iGPU, and expectations should be tempered—Intel says the Arc B390 is around 10% faster on average than an Nvidia RTX 4050, and that's not exactly a lightning-fast graphics card. High settings then, 1200p. No upscaling, no ray tracing. The result? (Image credit: Future) A perfectly …",

Now the two lands exist side by side, but anyone who crosses from one to the other is transformed, no longer quite the same person (or elf or boggart) they were on the other side. This duality is demonstrated in a short film called One Light, One Dark that's basically a Magic-themed Muppet musical, with characters designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop singing about how different their lives are on either side of the twilight border. On the one side, they playfully squeeze frogs. On the other, they murder pigeons. Swings and roundabouts, really. It's delightful is what it is. And while it's also a perfect opportunity for the Fun Police to say how this proves Magic is better when it concentrates on its original setting rather than crossovers, I think I'd be even more stoked if this was a Muppets/Labyrinth/Dark Crystal set.

Some are basic, like dirt, gravel, or wood, but it doesn't take long to start encountering more exotically named blocks like \"Horn Coral,\" \"Pink Terracotta,\" and \"Mossy Cobblestone.\" While perusing the list of 700 or so Minecraft blocks earlier today—this is the sort of thing I do on my lunch break—I thought the names of some of them sounded quite a bit like the fanciful monikers given to luxury paint colors. Tell me a block called \"Cyan Terracotta\" doesn't also sound like a paint color you'd find at Dulux or Farrow & Ball or some other fancy-schmancy paint company. Sounds like a great excuse for a quiz! Below I'll give you some names, and all you've gotta do is tell me if it's the name of a Minecraft block or a luxury paint color . Easy! Or is it?

It's a decent size for gaming, but I'll be honest, juggling tabs around between dual browser windows is a massive pain in the arse.

While there's a brief tutorial for the early access survival game, you're largely on your own when it comes to figuring out anything but the basics. So if you're looking for the Stator blueprint , an important early production item, you might be wondering where you even begin to search. Thankfully, the Stator blueprint isn't all that far from your starting point—in fact, you've probably spotted the location the moment you stepped out of the landing pod—though you will have to do some running and bug-killing to find it. Make sure you've at least crafted a pistol and some ammo before you head out, but you won't need more than that. StarRupture Stator blueprint location Watch the video above, which begins at the starting zone just outside your lander. Look almost directly north and you'll see a ruined structure in the distance on a ridge . It's hard to see, but it's there—if it helps, orient yourself by looking at the huge metal turbine that dominates the landscape, then swing your view left until you see the structure.

Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.\" There's also at least one spoiler in the rating, and avert your eyes now if you don't want to know: At one point during a party scene, the player is offered the option to drink some wine. But the drink is spiked, and you end up \"tripping balls\" on magic mushrooms—so if you don't want that to happen, just say no.

But a group of players found out this week that there is such a thing as too much damage in Path of Exile 2. At a certain point, the game can't calculate the numbers anymore and, instead of pulling a Diablo 4 and going negative , the damage just stops. The boss health bar doesn't budge like some kind of punishment for pushing it further than the developers intended. YouTuber Swedge , and a few other players, discovered that PoE 2 shares the same damage cap as Path of Exile 1 by lighting bosses on fire for obscene amounts of damage. They put together builds that complement each other by multiplying the damage output to the highest degree. But the result was far from satisfying. If you manage to hit a boss for over 35.79 million damage per second, the game refuses to calculate it anymore.

Surely as a larger pile of peaceful players checked off their final quests, cultivated stockpiles of valuables, or reset their progress altogether, they would turn to ruthless PvP as a means for variety. Nope. My Arc Raiders solo lobbies are as chill and blood-quenched as ever. \"Don't shoot\" remains the preferred weapon of my fellow scrappers, and when the odd murderer does make themselves known, the rest of the server tends to go full white blood cell on their ass.

Historically, QLC isn't what you want anywhere near your SSD, due to its high bits per cell leading to sluggish performance and questionable reliability.
