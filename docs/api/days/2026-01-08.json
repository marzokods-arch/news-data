    "body": "With 2026 in full swing, there’s no doubt that the “new year, new me” mentality has kicked in. And as tradition holds, Billboard has curated the ultimate playlist to kickstart your year on a strong and positive note. Titled “New Year, New Me: El 2026 Playlist,” the list includes more than one hour of feel-good music, mainly charged with powerful affirmations turned into lyrics. In songs such as Karol G’s “Milagros,” Bad Bunny’s “Estamos Bien” and “Bendecido” by Dale Pututi and Gente de Zona&#8217;s Randy Malcom, the artists share sentiments about feeling at peace, being blessed in their personal lives and having successful careers. Beéle’s “Algo Bueno,” Elena Rose’s “La De Dios,” and Yami Safdie and Camilo’s “Querida Yo,” on the other hand, are tracks that reflect on self-love, evolution and the importance of manifestation because the best is yet to come. “Evil wants to trap me, but it won&#8217;t succeed/ I have angels protecting me, where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way/ It&#8217;s never too late to be reborn/ You will always see the best part of me,&#8221; Beéle sings on his smooth Afrobeats track.

He lived at a modest traditional British home in southeast London that had a living and dining room/kitchen downstairs, and two bedrooms upstairs with his family, and dreamed of becoming a musical great. That fabled house, 4 Plaistow Grove in Bromley, is now set to be a place of pilgrimage for Bowie fans when it is restored and reopened to the public in the coming years. The home, where Bowie lived between ages 8 and 20, has been acquired by the Heritage of London Trust in a landmark purchase. The premises will restore the house back to its original early 1960s appearance and is set to open to the public in late 2027.&nbsp; Bowie was born in Brixton, south London, and moved to the property with his mother and father in 1955. He lived at the premises until 1967, around the time that he released his self-titled debut album on Decca Records, though he returned often in the following years. The announcement of the heritage project comes on what would have been Bowie’s 79th birthday (Jan. 8), and just days before the 10th anniversary of his Jan. 10, 2016, passing.

Now that holiday music has retreated from the Hot 100 for the season, “Choosin’ Texas” accelerates into the top five, earning Langley her first career top 10 hit. In the process, she joins a notably small group of women to score a top 10 Hot 100 hit this century with a country song. Just how rare is that feat? Dating back to 2000, only 12 women or all-female groups have charted in the Hot 100’s top 10 with a country song, defined as songs eligible for Billboard ’s Hot Country Songs chart. And across the past 26 years, just 24 country songs by women have reached the top tier of the Hot 100. To add some context and perspective to that, 1,512 total songs have reached the top 10 of the chart this century, and of those, just 60 were country songs. That’s just 3.96%. And of that, 1.6% of all top 10s this century have been country songs by women. Even with that limited pool, many of the entries come with qualifiers…",

The milestone demonstrates the element can provide the spacecraft with power, high-rate communications, attitude control, as well as the ability to maintain and maneuver between orbits. The Power and Propulsion Element is managed by NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and built by industry partner Lanteris Space Systems in Palo Alto, California, where teams have secured the element’s main electrical system inside protective exterior panels. On deck for installation at Lanteris Space Systems are three 12-kilowatt advanced electric propulsion system thrusters, manufactured by L3Harris, and four 6-kilowatt Busek-built BHT-6000 thrusters.

That idea has been around for years on paper, but the reality is that it has taken much longer for robot mowers to live up to that hands-off ideal. The problem hasn’t been power or even cutting ability. Modern robotic mowers are more than capable of trimming grass cleanly and consistently. Where things have historically fallen apart is navigation. A mower that can’t reliably understand where it is or where to go will always need more babysitting than most people expect from an “autonomous” machine.",

With a future update, your Android device may also tell you the exact time your clock has moved. This will save time trying to figure out the time difference yourself. With Android 16 QPR2 , which rolled out last month, Google introduced alerts every time your phone automatically switches to a new timezone . However, the feature doesn’t tell you exactly how many hours or minutes your clocks shifted, which can make you take an extra step to look it up on Google if you’re unaware of the exact time difference or want to figure out the time where your journey originated.

    "body": "For the last couple of years, Clicks has been one of the more interesting brands in the mobile accessory space. After creating keyboard cases for various iPhone and Android phone models, the company came to CES 2026 to showcase something a little different: a keyboard you can attach to any smartphone, without the commitment of a full-on case. It’s called the Clicks Power Keyboard, and it snaps onto the back of your phone via MagSafe/Qi2 magnets — instantly turning your phone into a modern-day BlackBerry. Compared to Clicks’ keyboard cases , the Power Keyboard has a couple of key benefits: 1) You can attach and remove the Clicks Power Keyboard much more easily than a case, and 2) it allows the keyboard to be attach to any phone that has magnets, whether built into it or via a compatible case.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google might have begun working on navigation support for Android XR using Google Maps. Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.

You’ll be able to add AI-generated weather effects to your lock screen wallpaper based on local weather conditions. Effects like rain or snowfall realistically move behind visible objects or people, rather than simply sitting on top of the wallpaper image. Smartphone brands have been paying extra attention to the lock screen lately, treating it as more than just a place to check notifications or check the time. From richer widgets to personalized wallpapers, the smartphone lock screen is becoming more personal, useful, and visually engaging. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update looks set to continue that trend with a new weather-driven feature that adds a bit of magic to your wallpaper, and closely mirrors a similar idea Google already offers on Pixel phones.

Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees.

Every year, alongside the headline-grabbing TVs, laptops, and smart home gadgets, there are products that don’t always get the same attention but still shape everyday life. Pool care is one of them. For years, robotic pool cleaners have promised convenience, but many still require a fair amount of hands-on effort once the cleaning is done. At CES 2026, Beatbot is using that gap as an opportunity to rethink what modern pool care can look like. One of the global leaders in robotic pool cleaning is unveiling two new products at the show: the flagship Beatbot AquaSense X, designed to push pool automation further than before, and the Beatbot Sora 70 , a model focused on dependable, everyday cleaning. Together, they show two distinct approaches to the same problem, with AquaSense X very clearly leading the charge.",

According to an investor note by Morgan Stanley (spotted via AppleInsider ), Apple will only adopt 200MP cameras on the iPhone 21 series in 2028.

Users can purchase the full game experience once their trial ends, and their progress will be carried over. The feature is likely to be an opt-in tool for game developers, helping them attract users who are hesitant about upfront costs. The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it. Google may be looking to address this issue, as the Play Store could soon offer a new “Try before you buy” feature for premium games.

These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR A country has introduced new rules that dramatically limit how long unskippable video ads can run on platforms like YouTube. The move targets long, forced ads and also bans delays when closing static ads. While ads fund creators on the platform, the regulation aims to rein in practices that many users feel are seriously hurting the viewing experience. It’s safe to say that unskippable ads on YouTube are only getting longer and becoming an extreme nuisance. Of course, you can always pay for YouTube Premium to eliminate ads or use alternatives like the Morphe app , but the truth is that those options aren’t for everyone. No one can really stop YouTube from running more ads on the platform or increasing the length of unskippable commercials, which currently go up to 30 seconds. However, one country is now fighting back, not with popular opinion, but actual laws.",

Both models support cutting-edge standards, including Dolby Vision Gaming, HDR10+, IMAX Enhanced, and Filmmaker Mode. They feature MediaTek’s MT9655 chip and run Google TV based on Android TV 14. Kickstarter launches in early February at $2,199 (Max) and $1,999 (Pro), with retail availability starting in April for $4,499 and $3,499, respectively. Projectors are fast emerging as a popular alternative to having a giant TV in the living room , and it makes sense, too. Instead of having a TV imposing and commanding attention all the time, a projector moves out of the way when the job is done. At CES 2026 , we’ve seen numerous new projectors from companies such as Samsung , Epson , and XGIMI .

Leaker Digital Chat Station posted purported OnePlus 15T specs on Weibo. For one, the device is said to have a flat 6.3-inch 165Hz screen (1.5K resolution).

DRAM and storage power everything from phones to fridges, but AI servers are buying it in bulk, leaving less for consumer devices. Samsung just issued a warning that’s hard to miss. The huge demand for memory chips — driven by AI data center buildouts — is squeezing supplies so tightly that prices across the electronics world are set to climb. At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Samsung’s global marketing head, Wonjin Lee, made it clear that shortages in memory supply are real, and they’re already nudging costs upward, Bloomberg reports. While the company doesn’t want to pass those costs straight to shoppers, Lee admitted that Samsung is starting to consider “repricing” its products to reflect the new economics.",

Since beginning the project, Google released the source code for nearly every new version of Android for mobile devices, typically doing so within days of rolling out the corresponding update to its own Pixel mobile devices. Starting this year, however, Google is making a major change to its release schedule for Android source code drops: AOSP sources will only be released twice a year. Google told Android Authority that, effective 2026, Google will publish new source code to AOSP in Q2 and Q4.
