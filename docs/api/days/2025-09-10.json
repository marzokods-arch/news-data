It's also a brilliant excuse to re-open the reliably polarising difficulty in games debate. I can't remember there ever being this much buzz for an exploration platformer before, but aside from the aforementioned difficulty, there's probably a few good reasons why you might bounce off Silksong. Perhaps you suffer entomophobia? Maybe you abhor protracted boss run backs ? Or maybe you're just averse to hype and want to dive into Silksong once the buzz has quietened down and the post-launch updates have smoothed its roughest edges? If you don't like Silksong but do love labyrinthine 2D platformers, we've put together a list of some great alternatives. Silksong belongs to a very crowded genre, one that has spawned countless games over the last decade. What's below isn't exhaustive, but all come highly recommended if you're after something like Silksong with a different flavor.

Serving to acquaint us with four new Vault Hunters and the setting they'll be gunning through, they've taken us everywhere from a bus driving across Pandora to a rocket hurtling through space. At their best, they set the tone perfectly. At their worst, their forced action hero coolness can inch over into cringe. Across the breadth of the now 16 year old series, in spin-offs, sequels, and pre-sequels, we've seen the full spectrum. (Image credit: Gearbox) So, as we wait to see what new cinematic Borderlands 4 lavishes us with, I think it's the perfect time to make the definitive ranking of the series' intros, from the first game right through to Tiny Tina's Wonderlands—though leaving out New Tales from the Borderlands, which rudely doesn't feature one at all. We'll start with the worst, and work our way up to the best, using the most rigorous of decision-making criteria. Disagree with my picks? Let me know in the comments. Just make sure your thoughts are accompanied by a catchy 2000s-era rock song, please. 6: Tiny Tina's Wonderlands…",

So much so, in fact, that our Jeremy theorised that what the devs likely meant is it would require a CPU with a minimum of eight software threads, which even an ancient four-core CPU with multi-threading support would technically cover. Well, the specs have now been updated on the community page , and they look identical—save for one note. (Image credit: Gearbox) Next to the same eight-core minimum CPU requirement is an asterisk, and that asterisk points to the phrase \"or equivalent.\" Which means... I'm not entirely sure. Again, the temptation is to think that we're likely talking about thread requirements again here, although an eight-thread CPU is not equivalent to an eight-core model. In fact, not even close.

You could use a different panel and still get 75 Hz.\" Commonly referred to as e-paper, electrophoretic displays manipulate electric fields in order to move differently-coloured charged particles suspended within a clear fluid, resulting in a series of ink-on-paper-like images displayed onscreen. The primary advantage of this method is readability, given that t…",

You'll have to contend with silk-stealing ghosts, traps galore, and tricky platforming to make it to the other side—that's not even mentioning the one trick you'll need to actually navigate the region. Just to be 100% clear, The Mist has no map . You can enter it via both Bilewater, to the left of the Bellway there, or through the top of Sinner's Road, but either way, you won't be getting a map. That said, the surprise on the other side is well worth it if you're up for the challenge. Here's how to navigate The Mist in Silksong and also kill the pesky ghost enemies who dog your progress. How to find a way through The Mist in Silksong There's one important trick to finding a route through The Mist, and that's the little golden moths you spot floating in each area.

Fonseca explains how he \"built a bridge from 2001 to today, making a vintage game console talk to a cloud-based AI without modifying a single line of the original game's code.\" The villagers are central to the game and their dialogue is what makes it so special, so how does AI add anything to the already charming world? From the looks of it, this AI mod tries to keep the villagers as close to their character as possible. The game code itself wasn't changed, but the dialogue strings within said code, of course, were. The method Josh settled upon was to use Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to write data directly into a memory address in the GameCube's RAM. He used a bespoke Python memory scanner and \"after hours of talking\" to the in-game villagers and scanning, the memory addresses were found and \"I could now reliably read who was talking and,…",

Still, for now, here are some tips to take down this Shellwood granny, including some handy clips for illustrative purposes. How to beat Sister Splinter in Silksong There are two main things that make Sister Splinter a bit tricky and those are: The spiky roots she periodically summons throughout the fight. These restrict your movement, making it harder to dodge her downward claw attacks but also… The flying minions she also summons periodically throughout the fight. This combination can be tough to beat with no strategy, so here are some tips that'll help you deal with each element.

Until next year, that is, and the launch of Nova Lake . That's right, peeps, when Intel's next-gen CPU architecture arrives at the end of 2026, Intel will ascend to a leadership position across the board on desktop. To quote John Pitzer, Intel's Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations, precisely , \"as Nova Lake comes out at the end of next year into 2027, I think we're going to have a leadership position across the board on desktop.\" That is one heck of a bold claim, even for a chip that's rumoured to pack up to 52 cores . Of course, it will at least in part hinge on the quality of Intel's upcoming 18A process, the node formerly known as the one upon which Pat Gelsinger bet the entire company, but latterly more of a stepping stone back to profitability, with 14A being the node on which Intel's hopes to build chips for customers now depends on . Unsurprisingly, Pitzer is bullish on 18A, too. He says Intel is planning to spend heavily on tooling up to produce lots of chips on 18A and return Intel t…",

(Image credit: Deep Silver) Staggering enemies with a punch before finishing them off guarantees they'll drop health, while throwing a core at them ensures they'll drop ammo. If you were detecting a hint of the Bethesda Dooms about Metal Eden you're spot on. There's also a fair chu…",

In a world where even FromSoftware—the worst offenders of hellish boss runbacks in the Dark Souls series—all but ditched them in Elden Ring, Silksong is here straight out of the 2010s to remind us of when games just straight up wasted our time. Clawing your way to a boss in Silksong is merely step one of the trial that awaits you when you inevitably die. Instead of showing you mercy and letting you respawn a few steps away from the fight, it drops you in a different zip code. What could be a short jog back to the boss is actually an obstacle course of spikes, falling rocks, and flies equipped with sniper rifles. Silksong will kill you with bosses who wipe out half of your health bar with a sneeze and then laugh as you trip and fall on the way back. It's so brutal that even fans of the original Hollow Knight, which has its fair share of rough runbacks, can't believe how bad it is from the start . It doesn't help that it takes Silksong all of 20 minutes before it starts throwing out enemies and environmental hazards …",

The exchange began with a video of leaked Operation Firestorm gameplay depicting an engineer sniping and firing rockets from the map's highest tower. To critics of Battlefield 6's controversial \"open weapons\" default ruleset , the scenario is a perfect example of why letting any class use any gun disrupts the balance of Battlefield. \"A classic demonstration of why open classes don't work.

Of course there is also much twirling of light sabers.

Called Critterz, the film follows forest creatures who embark on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger—a fairly generic setup for a Pixar-esque tale of talking wildlife where it doesn't belong. But the real purpose of the project, according to a press release from production company Vertigo Films , is \"to prove that generative artificial intelligence can make movies faster and cheaper than Hollywood does today.\" Critterz has a budget of less than $30 million, far below what animated films like this typically cost—Toy Story 4, released in 2019, had a budget of approximately $200 million —and is expected to take only about nine months to make. Critterz was initially conceived by Chad Nelson, a \"creative specialist\" at OpenAI, and made its debut in a 2023 animated film based on images—\"every character, every background... basically the entire Crittzer world\"—generated by OpenAI's Dall.E image generation tool, which were \"handed to a t…",

Dark Deception is a horror game based around a Resi-style mazy hotel filled with lots of horrible monsters that has, per So It Goes, sold over six-and-a-half million copies and had 58 million players. The game was created by Glowstick CEO Vincent Livings, and will be adapted by Adrian Speckert and Cory Todd Hughes: there's no news yet on any casting or director. Glowstick's Dark Deception may have plenty of monsters, but it was a spinoff that led to a public spat with Monster Energy, the ubiquitous energy drink brand owned by Coca Cola. Part of Monster's marketing is aimed at the gamer demographic but, outside of official tie-ins like Death Stranding, this means it has been somewhat litigious within the games industry: it even took on Ubisoft over Immortals: Fenyx Rising (which was at one stage called Gods and Monsters).

The Bardcore update and Boglands DLC drop simultaneously, on October 28. Bardcore will be free (hence \"free update,\" who'd have thought?) while Boglands will cost some money—how much remains to be seen. I don't know how much—developer Chasing Carrots has yet to slap a price tag on the new stuff, but with the base game costing a mere $6.66 (£5.49, because everything's less metal in Britain), I'm gonna venture a guess Boglands won't break your bank account. Unless your bank account has under five bucks in it, in which case you have my solidarity as another victim of capital. The free update by itself sounds pretty substantial. Bardcore brings a new character—the Bard, naturally—along with six new abilities for them, six new endgame artefacts, over 20 new quests, and manual level ups.

    "body": "As long as I've known it the internet has always been a rapidly changing phenomenon . From humble beginnings it has grown into a world-connecting platform by evolving to meet the needs of the public, often before they even know they have them. As websites like Google grew into infamy, they became integral in forging the future of the internet for better or worse. In more recent years, the shape of this development has shifted towards the benefits of corporations, with ad spends and SEO demands coming before the needs of the people. In this time search results have notably gotten much, much worse and continue to do so. This has lead to people dropping Google for search , despite it once being so popular we adopted it as a verb. Now we've seen this shift again, with often not-quite-correct chatbots and AI summaries being put forward as an alternative to genuine research and understanding. Let alone the greater environmental implications of the power used to generate such things. At least there's a browser extension that gets rid of them , for now anyway. Websites have noticed their traffic decreasing thanks to this new way of packaging information, though Google has denied this decl…",

The company released a status warning explaining that while it has managed to redirect traffic any traffic going through the Middle East will experience delays in service until the cut cables can be repaired. With Azure being one of the biggest cloud service providers around, the latency issues are sure to affect a large number of people and corporations. So far reports have indicated places such as the United Arab Emirates as well as parts of Asia have been experiencing delays since the damage. There's currently no word on how long it will take to resolve the problem. \"We do expect higher latency on some traffic that previously traversed through the Middle East until the undersea fiber cuts are fully addressed. Network traffic that does not traverse through the Middle East is not impacted,\" Microsoft says on the Azure status website . The cause of the damage to the cables hasn't been stated, merely that they've been cut. This could mean they were damaged by boat anchors or natural causes, but many are speculating that it coul…",
