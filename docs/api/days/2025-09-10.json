Last week, however, Nintendo received a more troubling weapon in its legal arsenal: US patent 12,403,397 , a patent on summoning and battling characters that the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted with alarmingly little resistance. According to videogame patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon, the USPTO granting Nintendo these latest patents isn't just a moment of questionable legal theory. It's an indictment of American patent law. \"Broadly, I don't disagree with the many online complaints about these Nintendo patents,\" said Sigmon, whose opinions do not represent those of his firm and clients. \"They have been an embarrassing failure of the US patent system.\" (Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO) Sigmon, who we spoke with last year about the claims and potential consequences of Nintendo's Palworld lawsuit , said both this week's '387 patent and last week's '397 represent procedural irregularities in the decisionmaking…",

One day after its launch, Coronations holds a \"mostly negative\" rating on Steam , driven by complaints about the minimal additions it makes to the games and the bugs it brings along with it. \"This is literally a DLC that doesn't change anything,\" one reviewer wrote. \"I understand that it's a content pack, but it's at the level of a mod from a workshop, or a small free update, as an attention-grabber for a major update.

    "body": "كشف تقرير صحفي إسباني، اليوم الأربعاء، عن الأسباب التي تدفع الألماني هانز فليك، المدير الفني لبرشلونة، للتمسك بعودة تياجو ألكانتارا إلى الجهاز الفني للفريق. ورغم أن برشلونة لم يعلن رسميًا عن عودة تياجو حتى الآن، إلا أن عدة تقارير صحفية أكدت أنه بات قريبًا جدًا من استلام مهامه، خصوصًا بعد ظهوره مؤخرًا في المدينة الرياضية للنادي، على الرغم من عدم توقيع العقود بشكل نهائي. وكان تياجو قد عمل مع فليك في بداياته مع برشلونة كمترجم، بجانب تقديم المساعدة الفنية للاعبي خط الوسط. ووفقًا لصحيفة \" سبورت \" الكتالونية، فإن فليك يعتبر خبرات تياجو \"لا تُقدر بثمن\"، ويرى فيه عنصرًا محوريًا يمكنه تقديم إضافة نوعية للجهاز الفني. ويُركز تياجو على تفاصيل دقيقة مثل تمركز الجسم، وقراءة اللعب، وديناميكيات خط الوسط، وهي عناصر برع فيها خلال مسيرته كلاعب مع ليفربول وبايرن ميونخ وبرشلونة سابقًا. كما يتميز تياجو ألكانتارا بشخصيته المؤثرة داخل غرفة الملابس، وقدرته على التواصل المباشر مع اللاعبين، وهو ما منحه احترامًا واسعًا بينهم. وبحكم خبرته كلاعب عانى من إصابات خطيرة، يدرك تياجو تمامًا ما يعيشه لاعبو برشلونة المصابون حاليًا مثل جافي ومارك بيرنال، ما يجعله حلقة وصل مثالية بين الجهاز الفني واللاعبين. ويرى فليك أن تياجو ألكانتارا يملك الشخصية القيادية والقدرة على مساعدة لاعبي خط الوسط الشباب داخل الملعب وخارجه، ال…",

It's also a brilliant excuse to re-open the reliably polarising difficulty in games debate. I can't remember there ever being this much buzz for an exploration platformer before, but aside from the aforementioned difficulty, there's probably a few good reasons why you might bounce off Silksong. Perhaps you suffer entomophobia? Maybe you abhor protracted boss run backs ? Or maybe you're just averse to hype and want to dive into Silksong once the buzz has quietened down and the post-launch updates have smoothed its roughest edges? If you don't like Silksong but do love labyrinthine 2D platformers, we've put together a list of some great alternatives. Silksong belongs to a very crowded genre, one that has spawned countless games over the last decade. What's below isn't exhaustive, but all come highly recommended if you're after something like Silksong with a different flavor.

Listed on the Steam page was the insistence that the game would require eight CPU cores as a minimum, which seemed highly unlikely given how many speedy six core processors there are on the market. So much so, in fact, that our Jeremy theorised that what the devs likely meant is it would require a CPU with a minimum of eight software threads, which even an ancient four-core CPU with multi-threading support would technically cover. Well, the specs have now been updated on the community page , and they look identical—save for one note. (Image credit: Gearbox) Next to the same eight-core minimum CPU requirement is an asterisk, and that asterisk points to the phrase \"or equivalent.\" Which means... I'm not entirely sure. Again, the temptation is to think that we're likely talking about thread requirements again here, although an eight-thread CPU is not equivalent to an eight-core model. In fact, not even close.

And then, well, you can probably guess what happened next: players turned out in impromptu throngs to join Gr3g1n4t0r in their tribute to their child.

Fonseca explains how he \"built a bridge from 2001 to today, making a vintage game console talk to a cloud-based AI without modifying a single line of the original game's code.\" The villagers are central to the game and their dialogue is what makes it so special, so how does AI add anything to the already charming world? From the looks of it, this AI mod tries to keep the villagers as close to their character as possible. The game code itself wasn't changed, but the dialogue strings within said code, of course, were. The method Josh settled upon was to use Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to write data directly into a memory address in the GameCube's RAM. He used a bespoke Python memory scanner and \"after hours of talking\" to the in-game villagers and scanning, the memory addresses were found and \"I could now reliably read who was talking and,…",

Still, for now, here are some tips to take down this Shellwood granny, including some handy clips for illustrative purposes. How to beat Sister Splinter in Silksong There are two main things that make Sister Splinter a bit tricky and those are: The spiky roots she periodically summons throughout the fight.

In fact, it's essentially an entire region devoted to a single challenging goal—climbing your way to the top of the mountain. You'll have to use every movement ability open to you, including the Clawline , which you'll have to unlock if you haven't already, in order to make this trip. The reward is worth it, though, since Mount Fay gives you the Faydown Cloak double jump ability, allowing you to reach lots of new places. It's also a vital upgrade for doing certain quests like the Great Taste of Pharloom . Either way, here's how to get to Mount Fay in Silksong and climb it via the route, along with videos showing both. How to reach Mount Fay in Silksong You can reach Mount Fay via the Choral Chambers once you arrive in Act 2 , but as mentioned, you'll need the Clawline ability to actually climb it. You can get this from the right side of the Underworks, accessed through Whiteward if you grab the White Key in the top right of the Choral Chambers to the right of The First Shrine, and then use it on the locked elevator on the area's bottom level. Either that or you can go through th…",

But our long national nightmare is over: as of September 9th's Steam mega-update , the client has a new feature to put an end to it. \"Added a Customization tab to game properties,\" read the patch notes. \"The Customization tab allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game and set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library.\" In other words, you can now set what is effectively a hidden name for all your games that Steam will use to sort them.

But as player excitement swells, the closer we get to GTA 6's release, so does some developers' anxiety. In an interview with MinnMax (via VGC ), Ghost of Yōtei creative director Nate Fox was asked if the dev team celebrated at all when they heard about GTA 6's delay , to which he replied: \"We're all still hungover. Multi-month hangover. That was a great day.\" It's no secret that GTA 6 isn't worried about competing for players' attention—a former GTA dev even joked that GTA 6 has \"no competition\" and so can release whenever the developers see fit. But the same can't be said for all the other studios releasing games in and around the next year. A Bloomberg report from a year ago uncovered how developers were hanging back on announcing release dates in anticipation of GTA 6 because they wanted to avoid the original Fall 2025 window like the plague: \"They're determined to keep their own games far, far away.\" Some brave developers didn't shy away from releasing games in Fall 2025, on…",

There's a bunch more robot enemies in this arena, and I saw some ammo up on the wallrun I could reach while I wait for the core-yanking ability to come back online.

Clawing your way to a boss in Silksong is merely step one of the trial that awaits you when you inevitably die. Instead of showing you mercy and letting you respawn a few steps away from the fight, it drops you in a different zip code. What could be a short jog back to the boss is actually an obstacle course of spikes, falling rocks, and flies equipped with sniper rifles. Silksong will kill you with bosses who wipe out half of your health bar with a sneeze and then laugh as you trip and fall on the way back. It's so brutal that even fans of the original Hollow Knight, which has its fair share of rough runbacks, can't believe how bad it is from the start .

That was the state of last month's Battlefield 6 beta: tanks, helicopters, jets, and especially jeeps could never get much room to vroom before getting blasted by any number of anti-armor rockets, laser-guided missiles, stationary cannons, mines, or sticky explosives. A month ahead of launch, we have our first acknowledgement from DICE that vehicle balance needs work via lead producer David Sirland. The exchange began with a video of leaked Operation Firestorm gameplay depicting an engineer sniping and firing rockets from the map's highest tower. To critics of Battlefield 6's controversial \"open weapons\" default ruleset , the scenario is a perfect example of why letting any class use any gun disrupts the balance of Battlefield. \"A classic demonstration of why open classes don't work.

Of course there is also much twirling of light sabers.

Called Critterz, the film follows forest creatures who embark on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger—a fairly generic setup for a Pixar-esque tale of talking wildlife where it doesn't belong. But the real purpose of the project, according to a press release from production company Vertigo Films , is \"to prove that generative artificial intelligence can make movies faster and cheaper than Hollywood does today.\" Critterz has a budget of less than $30 million, far below what animated films like this typically cost—Toy Story 4, released in 2019, had a budget of approximately $200 million —and is expected to take only about nine months to make. Critterz was initially conceived by Chad Nelson, a \"creative specialist\" at OpenAI, and made its debut in a 2023 animated film based on images—\"every character, every background... basically the entire Crittzer world\"—generated by OpenAI's Dall.E image generation tool, which were \"handed to a t…",

Dark Deception is a horror game based around a Resi-style mazy hotel filled with lots of horrible monsters that has, per So It Goes, sold over six-and-a-half million copies and had 58 million players. The game was created by Glowstick CEO Vincent Livings, and will be adapted by Adrian Speckert and Cory Todd Hughes: there's no news yet on any casting or director. Glowstick's Dark Deception may have plenty of monsters, but it was a spinoff that led to a public spat with Monster Energy, the ubiquitous energy drink brand owned by Coca Cola. Part of Monster's marketing is aimed at the gamer demographic but, outside of official tie-ins like Death Stranding, this means it has been somewhat litigious within the games industry: it even took on Ubisoft over Immortals: Fenyx Rising (which was at one stage called Gods and Monsters). Monster throws its considerab…",

As it turns out, that's on the menu too, and you don't even have to wait for it. Steel Soul mode is a permadeath mode that becomes available in the original Hollow Knight after completing the game for the first time, and it does indeed make the game more difficult: Just as in real life, death is not a condition from which one can recover. Steel Soul mode is also present in Silksong, revealed by the presence of the Steel Soul achievement on Steam. But as discovered by redditor Buttnugtaster —man, I love quoting redditors in news stories—the Steel Soul mode in Silksong is not restricted to replays. By going to the \"Extras\" menu and entering Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right on your controller, you can unlock the Steel Soul mode immediately. Why would you want to do that to yourself? Look, people ask me the same question about picking digital mushrooms in a virtual forest . Everyone…",

    "body": "The arrival of Hollow Knight: Silksong and Borderlands 4 marks the end of this year's summer doldrums, a period from around April through the end of August when the rate of big-budget and highly-anticipated mainstream game releases is at its lowest. Lots of great games still release during this period, but the kinds of games that top Steam's wishlist chart tend to cluster at the beginning and end of the year, especially in February and October. This is a mistake, according to videogame market intelligence company Newzoo. In the free edition of the firm's 2025 Global Games Market Report , available today, Newzoo says that game publishers are causing \"avoidable cannibalization\" by all competing for attention and money at the same time of year. To come to its conclusion, Newzoo looked at triple-A singleplayer games that came out on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox between 2021 and 2024, defining triple-A in this case as games that cost $51 and up. February saw the most triple-A releases with 22, with October coming in just behind it with 21. The fewest $51+ games released in April, May, and July, with just seven in each of those months over the four-year span under examination. The dark mon…",
