    "body": "Climbing Mount Fay in Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of the game's most elaborate platforming sections. In fact, it's essentially an entire region devoted to a single challenging goal—climbing your way to the top of the mountain. You'll have to use every movement ability open to you, including the Clawline , which you'll have to unlock if you haven't already, in order to make this trip. The reward is worth it, though, since Mount Fay gives you the Faydown Cloak double jump ability, allowing you to reach lots of new places. It's also a vital upgrade for doing certain quests like the Great Taste of Pharloom . Either way, here's how to get to Mount Fay in Silksong and climb it via the route, along with videos showing both. How to reach Mount Fay in Silksong You can reach Mount Fay via the Choral Chambers once you arrive in Act 2 , but as mentioned, you'll need the Clawline ability to actually climb it. You can get this from the right side of the Underworks, accessed through Whiteward if you grab the White Key in the top right of the Choral Chambers to the right of The First Shrine, and then use it on the locked elevator on the area's bottom level. Either that or you can go through th…",

    "body": "Of the many challenges facing our home, the good ship planet Earth, surely none is greater than the fact our Steam libraries won't organise themselves properly. If you own the Assassin's Creed or Yakuza games, you know what I'm talking about: Steam's rigid alphabetisation of your library means that series are presented out of order. For instance, Yakuza Kiwami (which is Yakuza 1) comes after Yakuza 6, and Assassin's Creed Odyssey comes before AC Origins. Psychological torture. But our long national nightmare is over: as of September 9th's Steam mega-update , the client has a new feature to put an end to it. \"Added a Customization tab to game properties,\" read the patch notes. \"The Customization tab allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game and set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library.\" In other words, you can now set what is effectively a hidden name for all your games that Steam will use to sort them. So I could label the 12 Assassin's Creed games in my library as Assassin's Creed 1 through 12 to have them display in proper release order*, but the display names of the games themselves in my library woul…",

Apparently you can get fully-fledged RTX 3080 Ti PCs for just $32 from them. No, really, that's what one lucky (he says, through gritted teeth) Redditor got from a \"small auction place up in Columbus Ohio that only offers local pickup.\" It was advertised as just a chassis and they bought it \"specifically to build an AI development rig in later as I would need a large case for it\" and were naturally \"shocked to find out exactly what was in it … I've never gotten lucky like this before.\" The auction screenshot says the final bid was $23.50 but the Redditor says $32. Maybe there were additional fees for using the auction service. Whatever the case, it's a whole lot cheaper than getting a new gaming rig these days; I certainly wouldn't be quibbling over an extra $9.50. I bought a \"Case\" for $32 at auction from r/pcmasterrace Oh, and this isn't your average RTX 3080 Ti gaming PC, either. It's a powerhouse of a workstation with a Threadripper CPU and 256 GB of RAM.

But as player excitement swells, the closer we get to GTA 6's release, so does some developers' anxiety. In an interview with MinnMax (via VGC ), Ghost of Yōtei creative director Nate Fox was asked if the dev team celebrated at all when they heard about GTA 6's delay , to which he replied: \"We're all still hungover. Multi-month hangover. That was a great day.\" It's no secret that GTA 6 isn't worried about competing for players' attention—a former GTA dev even joked that GTA 6 has \"no competition\" and so can release whenever the developers see fit. But the same can't be said for all the other studios releasing games in and around the next year. A Bloomberg report from a year ago uncovered how developers were hanging back on announcing release dates in anticipation of GTA 6 because they wanted to avoid the original Fall 2025 window like the plague: \"They're determined to keep their own games far, far away.\" Some brave developers didn't shy away from releasing games in Fall 2025, on…",

That's right, peeps, when Intel's next-gen CPU architecture arrives at the end of 2026, Intel will ascend to a leadership position across the board on desktop. To quote John Pitzer, Intel's Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations, precisely , \"as Nova Lake comes out at the end of next year into 2027, I think we're going to have a leadership position across the board on desktop.\" That is one heck of a bold claim, even for a chip that's rumoured to pack up to 52 cores . Of course, it will at least in part hinge on the quality of Intel's upcoming 18A process, the node formerly known as the one upon which Pat Gelsinger bet the entire company, but latterly more of a stepping stone back to profitability, with 14A being the node on which Intel's hopes to build chips for customers now depends on . Unsurprisingly, Pitzer is bullish on 18A, too. He says Intel is planning to spend heavily on tooling up to produce lots of chips on 18A and return Intel t…",

    "body": "يستعد إنتر ميلان لمواجهة كبيرة عندما يحل ضيفا على يوفنتوس، بملعب أليانز ستاديوم، السبت المقبل، ضمن منافسات الجولة الثالثة من الدوري الإيطالي. وذكرت صحيفة \"كوريري ديلو سبورت\" الإيطالية، أن مدرب النيراتزوري كريستيان كيفو، يدرس الاعتماد على السويسري مانويل أكانجي، المدافع المنضم حديثا لإنتر، ضد يوفنتوس. وأضافت أنه رغم انضمام أكانجي خلال فترة الانتقالات الصيفية ورغم أنه لم يخض سوى 3 حصص تدريبية قبل لقاء يوفنتوس، إلا أن ظهوره الأول مع إنتر قد يكون بشكل أساسي. ولفتت إلى أن الخبرة الدولية تصب في مصلحة أكانجي، لا سيما في ظل الشكوك المحيطة بيان بيسيك، الذي يبدو أنه لا يزال يفتقر إلى اللياقة البدنية. وتألق أكانجي مع منتخب سويسرا خلال فترة التوقف الدولية الحالية، حيث سجل هدفا ضد كوسوفو، وقدم أداءً رائعا أمام سلوفينيا ومنع المهاجم سيسكو من التسجيل.",

While I'm up close and he's staggered I switch to shotgun to finish him off, then jetpack away. There's a bunch more robot enemies in this arena, and I saw some ammo up on the wallrun I could reach while I wait for the core-yanking ability to come back online. This is a fairly typical five seconds of Metal Eden, a superspeed neon FPS where you're a parkour android with a big bag of tools for movement and for destruction.

In a world where even FromSoftware—the worst offenders of hellish boss runbacks in the Dark Souls series—all but ditched them in Elden Ring, Silksong is here straight out of the 2010s to remind us of when games just straight up wasted our time. Clawing your way to a boss in Silksong is merely step one of the trial that awaits you when you inevitably die. Instead of showing you mercy and letting you respawn a few steps away from the fight, it drops you in a different zip code. What could be a short jog back to the boss is actually an obstacle course of spikes, falling rocks, and flies equipped with sniper rifles. Silksong will kill you with bosses who wipe out half of your health bar with a sneeze and then laugh as you trip and fall on the way back. It's so brutal that even fans of the original Hollow Knight, which has its fair share of rough runbacks, can't believe how bad it is from the start . It doesn't help that it takes Silksong all of 20 minutes before it starts throwing out enemies and environmental hazards …",

That was the state of last month's Battlefield 6 beta: tanks, helicopters, jets, and especially jeeps could never get much room to vroom before getting blasted by any number of anti-armor rockets, laser-guided missiles, stationary cannons, mines, or sticky explosives. A month ahead of launch, we have our first acknowledgement from DICE that vehicle balance needs work via lead producer David Sirland. The exchange began with a video of leaked Operation Firestorm gameplay depicting an engineer sniping and firing rockets from the map's highest tower. To critics of Battlefield 6's controversial \"open weapons\" default ruleset , the scenario is a perfect example of why letting any class use any gun disrupts the balance of Battlefield. \"A classic demonstration of why open classes don't work.

But the real purpose of the project, according to a press release from production company Vertigo Films , is \"to prove that generative artificial intelligence can make movies faster and cheaper than Hollywood does today.\" Critterz has a budget of less than $30 million, far below what animated films like this typically cost—Toy Story 4, released in 2019, had a budget of approximately $200 million —and is expected to take only about nine months to make. Critterz was initially conceived by Chad Nelson, a \"creative specialist\" at OpenAI, and made its debut in a 2023 animated film based on images—\"every character, every background... basically the entire Crittzer world\"—generated by OpenAI's Dall.E image generation tool, which were \"handed to a t…",

Deadline reports that Glowstick Entertainment has inked a deal for its survival horror game Dark Deception to be adapted into a feature film by indie production outfit So It Goes Entertainment. Dark Deception is a horror game based around a Resi-style mazy hotel filled with lots of horrible monsters that has, per So It Goes, sold over six-and-a-half million copies and had 58 million players. The game was created by Glowstick CEO Vincent Livings, and will be adapted by Adrian Speckert and Cory Todd Hughes: there's no news yet on any casting or director. Glowstick's Dark Deception may have plenty of monsters, but it was a spinoff that led to a public spat with Monster Energy, the ubiquitous energy drink brand owned by Coca Cola. Part of Monster's marketing is aimed at the gamer demographic but, outside of official tie-ins like Death Stranding, this means it has been somewhat litigious within the games industry: it even took on Ubisoft over Immortals: Fenyx Rising (which was at one stage called Gods and Monsters).

As it turns out, that's on the menu too, and you don't even have to wait for it. Steel Soul mode is a permadeath mode that becomes available in the original Hollow Knight after completing the game for the first time, and it does indeed make the game more difficult: Just as in real life, death is not a condition from which one can recover.

This is a mistake, according to videogame market intelligence company Newzoo. In the free edition of the firm's 2025 Global Games Market Report , available today, Newzoo says that game publishers are causing \"avoidable cannibalization\" by all competing for attention and money at the same time of year. To come to its conclusion, Newzoo looked at triple-A singleplayer games that came out on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox between 2021 and 2024, defining triple-A in this case as games that cost $51 and up. February saw the most triple-A releases with 22, with October coming in just behind it with 21.

Jorjani was replying on Discord to a player asking for \"a social hub space station (like the tower in Destiny.)\" Don't hold your breath: \"It's on the feature list for the next one,\" said Jorjani in response. This was not-unreasonably taken as a reference to Helldivers 3, but Jorjani quickly clarified this wasn't what he was on about. \"This was about our next game,\" said Jorjani , \"not HD3.\" (Image credit: Paradox Interactive ) OK, well that's enough for me to st…",

The Bardcore update and Boglands DLC drop simultaneously, on October 28. Bardcore will be free (hence \"free update,\" who'd have thought?) while Boglands will cost some money—how much remains to be seen. I don't know how much—developer Chasing Carrots has yet to slap a price tag on the new stuff, but with the base game costing a mere $6.66 (£5.49, because everything's less metal in Britain), I'm gonna venture a guess Boglands won't break your bank account. Unless your bank account has under five bucks in it, in which case you have my solidarity as another victim of capital. The free update by itself sounds pretty substantial. Bardcore brings a new character—the Bard, naturally—along with six new abilities for them, six new endgame artefacts, over 20 new quests, and manual level ups. Also, three new metal tracks, which is the most important entry on this list by quite some margin. But for the (p…",

Like our reviewer of the RX 9060 XT XFX Swift GPU , many have been pleased by the performance from the budget friendly offering. It seems it might have been a bit too quick, as new comparisons spotted by VideoCardz are showing ways the Samsung GDDR6 may actually be more beneficial, if a little less powerful than the SK Hynix offering. AMD partner XFX posted comparisons to Bilibili , a Chinese social blog site that often delves into PC gaming hardware critique. They tell the same story of less powerful GDDR6, but with a huge boon to cooling and potentially power consumption.

Still, it seems inevitable that in our tech-filled homes, this particular wireless band is eventually going to become saturated and disconnection problems will become more frequent. Two of our hardware team have had such issues, so they'll be particularly interested in the Elecom VM800 , an 8K wireless gaming mouse with ultra-wideband (UWB) support. In fact, Elecom claims it's the world's first \"true 8K\" mouse with said feature (via PC Watch ). True 8K refers to an 8,000 Hz polling rate that updates at exactly the same time on both ends of the connection, rather than a regular 8K connection that can potentially report new data from the device very quickly, but might not be polling at the exact same rate at the receiver. Anyhoo, let's talk about that connection spec. 2.4 GHz is the defacto standard for most wireless gear, as it became the default frequency for early Wi-Fi connections. To this day it's got the longest range and wall-penetration ability of the available bands, but because it's in such high demand, it can be prone to signal saturation issues when multiple dev…",

Yet if you happened to bounce off the game because of its story—something I couldn't rightly blame you for—you might be surprised to find out that all of its DLC is… actually pretty good, all-told, and there's a lot of it. Four solidly-stacked campaigns you might've entirely missed. While Borderlands 3's insistently wonky plot is otherwise a real obstacle, all of these DLCs stick to a theme and largely nail it. None of these things are winning BAFTAs, mind, but they all spin enjoyable yarns. More importantly, they don't oscillate between outdated memes and unsuccessful melodrama—they just grab a solid pitch and run with it.

I love it. I'd be sold on looks alone, but having gotten to play a section of Flask at Gamescom last month, I'm convinced there's a really solid roguelike here too. As you travel across a simple overworld map, you gather flasks for your homunculus warriors. These basically allow you to create a production line of actions in battle—one might be a simple attack, another a strength buff, and another a berserker strike that sacrifices health for damage. When you fight a goblin, each of you will run through all your flasks in order, and then if you're still alive, the process will continue to loop until goopy gre…",

Had I issued my thoughts on the Create after a month of use—the typical period for reviewing an ergonomic keyboard—the final score and verdict would have been very different to what's on this page, and not in a positive way. But let's start at the beginning. Naya is a small company, based in the Netherlands, that was founded around four years ago by a group of three friends. Setting out with a goal of making the Create, a bespoke keyboard for ergonomics and productivity, Naya's designs and plans resulted in a highly successful Kickstarter campaign . Multiple batches of the Create have already been sold out and shipped, and along with the sheer amount of money raised via crowdfunding, it's clear that there are a lot of computer users around the world who very much want one.

The fact that Sintopia takes place in Hell half the time probably should have warned me about how well my antics would go, but I didn't take the hint. Instead, I started my new job as manager of Hell and overlord of the humus, a sentient population of chickpeas. (Image credit: Team 17) Sintopia is kind of like two games in one. The overworld plays like a god game that has you casting spells to influence the humus. They go about their daily business with pretty limited intervention from you, farming crops, cutting down trees, electing a monarch to rule over them, and exploring the map to find new treasures and expand their village. I did spend a little bit of time helping them, like using a wind spell to blow away vicious animals that would attack hunting parties or ringing bells outside their homes at night to stop them from overpopulating the map.

For a while, game director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) has promised that this'll be changing in 8.0 , FF14's next expansion. Back in 2024, he stated: \"By strongly differentiating the jobs, we will be able to reach the goal we have set ourselves.\" It is now 2025, however, and a recent PCGamesN interview from Gamescom is casting doubt. As always with these interviews, Yoshi-P often speaks in Japanese with a live interpreter, so specific word choice might be skewed based on the hard work of a poor translator having to suffer the Gamescom hall's terrible cafeteria prices and the stifling heat of a German summer. Still: \"When it comes to using the jobs in battle content and bringing out more of that uniqueness of each job, we are working on a big update.\" So far, so good, Yoshi-P.

There'll also be a \"Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers\", which are the worms in the Blasted Steps—likely taking their damage from two masks to one. The game's rosary economy will also become less stingy: Relics, psalm cylinders, and courier deliveries will all have their rosary rewards increased, though I imagine it'll still be hard to match the farming routes already found by players—mind, any rosary bump is a welcome one, given how miserly the game is with these things until Act 2. Speaking of, Act 2's benches and bellways will have their prices reduced, too, so you shouldn't have to grind nearly as much—a welcome adjustment, given I kept having to go back to the ol' Songclave Grand Reed mines.

Enter Dave Plummer, an ex-Microsoft engineer whose other Windows contributions include Task Manager , native Zip file support, and Media Center, to name just a few (via The Register ). Speaking on his YouTube channel, Dave's Attic , Plummer revealed that when he ported the game to Windows NT from Windows 95, he wrote a whole new game engine around the original logic in order to handle the video rendering and sound. \"My game engine had a bug, in that it would draw frames as fast as it could\" said Plummer. At the time, the game was being coded on a MIPS R4000 processor running at a mighty 200 MHz, which resulted in the game running at 60-90 fps, a speed Plummer judged as \"plenty, for a game like that.\" \"Fast forward a couple of years later, somebody notices that o…",
