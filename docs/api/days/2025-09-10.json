Don't believe me? If I told you there was a new device selling for four figures with a high-Hz, adaptive refresh screen, backed by a sales pitch that name-checks \"AAA gaming\" and \"hardware-accelerated ray tracing\" and which introduces tensor cores to its newly upgraded GPU, what would you say it was? Oh, hang on, it also sports vapor-chamber cooling for its CPU and GPU, the performance upgrades are kind of incremental this time around, but the price has still gone up. See what I mean? That's the pitch for a new gaming PC or laptop. It's probably that new vapor-chamber cooling that's most eye catching. It's not a first for a smartphone, but when Apple sticks a technology into one of its devices, you know it's gone totally mainstream.

    "body": "Roughly two months ago we got our first look at the system requirements for Borderlands 4 , a process that involved many of us on the hardware team scrunching up our noses. Listed on the Steam page was the insistence that the game would require eight CPU cores as a minimum, which seemed highly unlikely given how many speedy six core processors there are on the market. So much so, in fact, that our Jeremy theorised that what the devs likely meant is it would require a CPU with a minimum of eight software threads, which even an ancient four-core CPU with multi-threading support would technically cover. Well, the specs have now been updated on the community page , and they look identical—save for one note. (Image credit: Gearbox) Next to the same eight-core minimum CPU requirement is an asterisk, and that asterisk points to the phrase \"or equivalent.\" Which means... I'm not entirely sure. Again, the temptation is to think that we're likely talking about thread requirements again here, although an eight-thread CPU is not equivalent to an eight-core model. In fact, not even close. Taking a look at those CPU minimums once more, we've got the Intel Core i7 9700 and the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X …",

And then, well, you can probably guess what happened next: players turned out in impromptu throngs to join Gr3g1n4t0r in their tribute to their child.

That's according to Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani. As spotted by VideoGamer , someone in the Helldivers 2 Discord asked Jorjani if we could ever expect to see the studio's elite soldiers squashing bugs in the likes of Swarmy Stash or Canyon Crossing anytime soon. \"Not a priority,\" he wrote in response. It doesn't seem like Jorjani is totally willing to close that door altogether, though. \"But who knows one day. [Fortnite] is cool. And quite big.\" A rather succinct response, but not wrong.

That's not even including the bunch of changes listed that are specific to Desktop Mode, Steam Input, Remote Play, Accessibility, and the Lenovo Legion Go S. (I'm not going to bother counting those; there's a lot, okay?) When I first got my hands on the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S , I was impressed with Valve's handheld operating system, but I found it wasn't without its quirks. The now-fixed issue with enabling Bluetooth after having it disabled in Desktop Mode, for instance, I think rings a bell. (Image credit: Future) One of the issues that most definitely bugged me, though, was that the on-screen keyboard didn't scale properly to the size of the screen when I had it in Desktop Mode with the UI scaled up. Scaling up the UI seemed pretty necessary to me because otherwise, things are just too small. You can see the problem I'm describing in the image above. Now, it looks like t…",

Wrong, according to the makers of the Modos Paper Monitor and Dev Kit , a crowdfunded, open-source solution that allows users to crank certain types of e-paper display all the way up to 75 Hz. You get an e-paper panel included with the kit, but Modos cofounder Alexander Soto reckons you could use the included display controller to significantly boost the refresh rate of many other models, too. \"I would say instead of our secret sauce, we have open sauce,” said Soto, speaking to IEEE Spectrum . \"You don't even need to use the panel we're offering. You could use a different panel and still get 75 Hz.\" Commonly referred to as e-paper, electrophoretic displays manipulate electric fields in order to move differently-coloured charged particles suspended within a clear fluid, resulting in a series of ink-on-paper-like images displayed onscreen.

Fonseca explains how he \"built a bridge from 2001 to today, making a vintage game console talk to a cloud-based AI without modifying a single line of the original game's code.\" The villagers are central to the game and their dialogue is what makes it so special, so how does AI add anything to the already charming world? From the looks of it, this AI mod tries to keep the villagers as close to their character as possible. The game code itself wasn't changed, but the dialogue strings within said code, of course, were. The method Josh settled upon was to use Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to write data directly into a memory address in the GameCube's RAM. He used a bespoke Python memory scanner and \"after hours of talking\" to the in-game villagers and scanning, the memory addresses were found and \"I could now reliably read who was talking and,…",

It's a taste of what's to come in terms of utilising everything in your arsenal to take down some of the tricky bosses later on. Sister Splinter might seem annoying, but with a few simple tools you'll definitely be able to overcome her, and then you'll get to face the Widow —a boss that's arguably much, much worse. Still, for now, here are some tips to take down this Shellwood granny, including some handy clips for illustrative purposes. How to beat Sister Splinter in Silksong There are two main things that make Sister Splinter a bit tricky and those are: The spiky roots she periodically summons throughout the fight. These restrict your movement, making it harder to dodge her downward claw attacks but also… The flying minions she also summons periodically throughout the fight. This combination can be tough to beat with no strategy, so here are some tips that'll help you deal with each element.

Until next year, that is, and the launch of Nova Lake . That's right, peeps, when Intel's next-gen CPU architecture arrives at the end of 2026, Intel will ascend to a leadership position across the board on desktop. To quote John Pitzer, Intel's Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations, precisely , \"as Nova Lake comes out at the end of next year into 2027, I think we're going to have a leadership position across the board on desktop.\" That is one heck of a bold claim, even for a chip that's rumoured to pack up to 52 cores . Of course, it will at least in part hinge on the quality of Intel's upcoming 18A process, the node formerly known as the one upon which Pat Gelsinger bet the entire company, but latterly more of a stepping stone back to profitability, with 14A being the node on which Intel's hopes to build chips for customers now depends on .

While I'm up close and he's staggered I switch to shotgun to finish him off, then jetpack away. There's a bunch more robot enemies in this arena, and I saw some ammo up on the wallrun I could reach while I wait for the core-yanking ability to come back online. This is a fairly typical five seconds of Metal Eden, a superspeed neon FPS where you're a parkour android with a big bag of tools for movement and for destruction. There's a grappling hook and double-jump, a freezy grenade, and a morph ball mode right out of Super Metroid that lets you roll around flinging homing missiles and lightning. (Image credit: Deep Silver) Staggering enemies with a punch before finishing them off guarantees they'll drop health, while throwing a core at them ensures they'll drop ammo.

In a world where even FromSoftware—the worst offenders of hellish boss runbacks in the Dark Souls series—all but ditched them in Elden Ring, Silksong is here straight out of the 2010s to remind us of when games just straight up wasted our time. Clawing your way to a boss in Silksong is merely step one of the trial that awaits you when you inevitably die. Instead of showing you mercy and letting you respawn a few steps away from the fight, it drops you in a different zip code. What could be a short jog back to the boss is actually an obstacle course of spikes, falling rocks, and flies equipped with sniper rifles. Silksong will kill you with bosses who wipe out half of your health bar with a sneeze and then laugh as you trip and fall on the way back. It's so brutal that even fans of the original Hollow Knight, which has its fair share of rough runbacks, can't believe how bad it is from the start . It doesn't help that it takes Silksong all of 20 minutes before it starts throwing out enemies and environmental hazards …",

A month ahead of launch, we have our first acknowledgement from DICE that vehicle balance needs work via lead producer David Sirland. The exchange began with a video of leaked Operation Firestorm gameplay depicting an engineer sniping and firing rockets from the map's highest tower. To critics of Battlefield 6's controversial \"open weapons\" default ruleset , the scenario is a perfect example of why letting any class use any gun disrupts the balance of Battlefield. \"A classic demonstration of why open classes don't work.

And if you're wondering just how much Star Wars has been ingested by Bungie's design team, at various points in the video we see a character frozen in carbonite, off-brand AT-ST walkers stomping across the battlefield, and a Sarlacc pit on Mars (which is doubling for Tatooine). Of course there is also much twirling of light sabers.

Called Critterz, the film follows forest creatures who embark on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger—a fairly generic setup for a Pixar-esque tale of talking wildlife where it doesn't belong. But the real purpose of the project, according to a press release from production company Vertigo Films , is \"to prove that generative artificial intelligence can make movies faster and cheaper than Hollywood does today.\" Critterz has a budget of less than $30 million, far below what animated films like this typically cost—Toy Story 4, released in 2019, had a budget of approximately $200 million —and is expected to take only about nine months to make. Critterz was initially conceived by Chad Nelson, a \"creative specialist\" at OpenAI, and made its debut in a 2023 animated film based on images—\"every character, every background... basically the entire Crittzer world\"—generated by OpenAI's Dall.E image generation tool, which were \"handed to a t…",

Dark Deception is a horror game based around a Resi-style mazy hotel filled with lots of horrible monsters that has, per So It Goes, sold over six-and-a-half million copies and had 58 million players. The game was created by Glowstick CEO Vincent Livings, and will be adapted by Adrian Speckert and Cory Todd Hughes: there's no news yet on any casting or director. Glowstick's Dark Deception may have plenty of monsters, but it was a spinoff that led to a public spat with Monster Energy, the ubiquitous energy drink brand owned by Coca Cola. Part of Monster's marketing is aimed at the gamer demographic but, outside of official tie-ins like Death Stranding, this means it has been somewhat litigious within the games industry: it even took on Ubisoft over Immortals: Fenyx Rising (which was at one stage called Gods and Monsters).

As it turns out, that's on the menu too, and you don't even have to wait for it. Steel Soul mode is a permadeath mode that becomes available in the original Hollow Knight after completing the game for the first time, and it does indeed make the game more difficult: Just as in real life, death is not a condition from which one can recover. Steel Soul mode is also present in Silksong, revealed by the presence of the Steel Soul achievement on Steam. But as discovered by redditor Buttnugtaster —man, I love quoting redditors in news stories—the Steel Soul mode in Silksong is not restricted to replays. By going to the \"Extras\" menu and entering Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right on your controller, you can unlock the Steel Soul mode immediately.

This is a mistake, according to videogame market intelligence company Newzoo. In the free edition of the firm's 2025 Global Games Market Report , available today, Newzoo says that game publishers are causing \"avoidable cannibalization\" by all competing for attention and money at the same time of year. To come to its conclusion, Newzoo looked at triple-A singleplayer games that came out on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox between 2021 and 2024, defining triple-A in this case as games that cost $51 and up. February saw the most triple-A releases with 22, with October coming in just behind it with 21.

Jorjani was replying on Discord to a player asking for \"a social hub space station (like the tower in Destiny.)\" Don't hold your breath: \"It's on the feature list for the next one,\" said Jorjani in response.

The Bardcore update and Boglands DLC drop simultaneously, on October 28. Bardcore will be free (hence \"free update,\" who'd have thought?) while Boglands will cost some money—how much remains to be seen. I don't know how much—developer Chasing Carrots has yet to slap a price tag on the new stuff, but with the base game costing a mere $6.66 (£5.49, because everything's less metal in Britain), I'm gonna venture a guess Boglands won't break your bank account. Unless your bank account has under five bucks in it, in which case you have my solidarity as another victim of capital. The free update by itself sounds pretty substantial. Bardcore brings a new character—the Bard, naturally—along with six new abilities for them, six new endgame artefacts, over 20 new quests, and manual level ups. Also, three new metal tracks, which is the most important entry on this list by quite some margin. But for the (p…",

Like our reviewer of the RX 9060 XT XFX Swift GPU , many have been pleased by the performance from the budget friendly offering. It seems it might have been a bit too quick, as new comparisons spotted by VideoCardz are showing ways the Samsung GDDR6 may actually be more beneficial, if a little less powerful than the SK Hynix offering. AMD partner XFX posted comparisons to Bilibili , a Chinese social blog site that often delves into PC gaming hardware critique. They tell the same story of less powerful GDDR6, but with a huge boon to cooling and potentially power consumption.

It's somehow not even the most cursed gacha game matchup to happen in recent months—Infinity Nikki just wrapped up a rather drama-mired Stardew Valley collab, and gooner gacha Nikke is about to have Jill Valentine all caked up to fight some Raptures—but I'm still not sure how I feel about seeing a tiny little crewmate all uwu'd up. 🤫🔪#GenshinXAmongUs #ItStartsInNodKrai pic.twitter.com/vbsCSB61Am September 8, 2025 The whole thing is part of celebrating Genshin's upcoming 6.0 version, Luna I, which launches the same day as the collaboration. It's adding new region Nod-Krai, story quests, and of course new banner characters to roll precious primogems on. Among Us will be getting a Paimon costume—complete with wig and crown and everything—along with a Genshin-themed nameplate. In the collaboration announcement, Innersloth says \"One of the Crewmates has been obsessed with playing Genshin Impact between tasks, so we had the pleasure of working with HoYoverse to cook up these cosmetics and satisfy your Paimon-ial needs for free.\" The Creation of Sus ඞ#GenshinXAmongUs #ItStartsInNodKr…",

    "body": "Passing the guild trial in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is your first step on the road to becoming a proper, accredited blacksmith and repairing the old forge in Kuttenburg. If, like me, you forged one hunting sword throughout your entire run of the main game and mainly acquired your gear via good old-fashioned theft and bandit brutality, you might need a few reminders. The guild trial consists of a theory test where you'll get asked a few questions, and then a forging test where you have to make a blacksmiths' guild longsword of a decent quality. I'll run through all potential question answers below, as well as a step-by-step for forging a longsword that'll pass the exam. All guild trial answers in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (Image credit: Warhorse Studios) As the first step of the test to become an accredited guild blacksmith, you'll be asked three random questions . If you get any of them wrong, you'll fail the theory section of the test, and that means you'll have to forge a much better weapon to be in with a chance. It's worth noting that even though you can pay money to retry the blade forging, you only get one shot at answering the questions (unless you load a save that is)…",
