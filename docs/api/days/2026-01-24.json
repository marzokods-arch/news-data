Instead, Geoff Keighley cued up a trailer for an unknown hero shooter called Highguard. It didn't go great. The social media reaction was instantly hostile. Highguard was received as a 'one more thing' trespasser that had claimed an unearned seat of honor, although its developer did not pay for the slot as many assumed. The reveal has become a case study in how not to announce a game, but what really got people worked up is what Highguard's developer did next: nothing. Highguard is launching on Steam next week, but the studio still hasn't said anything new about it publicly, aside from a tweet today announcing a livestream. Starved for a new trailer to dunk on in the endless competition to win the social media Cynicism Cup, posters have had to settle for generic declarations of Highguard's cookedness. That cynicism-for-cynicism's-sake aside, it feels safe to say that general distrust over this kind of game is at an all-time high. In Highguard's case, you do get a whiff of hubris f…",

For a lot of players, it's actually a surprisingly robust factory builder with some action RPG combat on the side. Rolling for the most powerful characters is only half the game; the rest is building the most efficient material processing plant you can. Now that everyone's realized what kind of game they're actually playing, someone went and built an entire simulator for designing factory blueprints to share with other players. EndfieldTools is currently getting slammed with traffic because it's the best spot for sharing factory blueprints and testing out layouts without having to waste resources in-game. The factory planner is essentially a simplified version of the real thing with tools to simulate how efficient your setup truly is. I haven't made it far enough in the game to understand a lot of what's available, but I can already see how much easier it is to click and place buildings without having to jump through menu…",

My hot take: Fallout 4 is a vastly superior game to Fallout 3, and deserves more credit than it gets in RPG snob circles. The writing is much better than you remember, with more interesting quests and characters than Fallout 3⁠. The color, vibrancy, and general art direction look fresh even 10 years on. The gunplay is so much better and more satisfying than the prior 3D Fallouts, and the weapon customization is a genuine advancement over what you see in New Vegas. This is actually the optimal settlement shape. (Image credit: Bethesda) That's not even getting to the settlement building stuff, which Fallou…",

The physics-based melee brawler is equal parts gore and clumsiness as players face off—and try to slash each other's faces off—with wildly-swung swords and axes and spears. Players loved that tech demo so much the sim quickly rocketed onto Steam's list of top wishlists, where it now sits in slot number 10 alongside big-budget games like Ark 2 and Forza Horizon 6. Well, sharpen your sword and polish your armor, because Half Sword is ready to spill its guts all over early access: it launches Friday, January 30. That's just next week! To celebrate, the developer, aptly named Half Sword Games, released a comically grisly new trailer set to a soundtrack of what I'll call one of the most delightfully unhinged songs ever written for a game in history. Watch and listen for yourself: The trailer begins with some bare-fisted boxing, but that quickly escalates to people's faces being pulverised on the ground or against wooden posts. Then it moves on to combatants wonkily destroying each other's bodies with hammers, axes, and swords. But you've seen stu…",

    "body": "The future of Prince of Persia has never seemed more fraught, as Ubisoft's money men announce a major reshuffling at the company . Jobs have been lost and multiple games have been cancelled, including the long-delayed and much-wanted remake of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. While the fate of Ubisoft's many studios is the more pressing concern (including staff already going on strike), along with the threat of a pivot towards even more live service games and generative AI, a gamer-level problem is that one of Ubi's most iconic adventures exists in a surprisingly sorry state. Fortunately we're PC gaming nerds, and we know how to solve such problems. Where to buy Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time If you don't already own a modern digital copy of Sands Of Time, you've got a few options. The first and most convenient is Steam , where the game goes for around $12 (£9). At the time of writing, the Ubisoft Store has the game discounted down to under $3 (£2), although, yes, you'll have to download it through their app. You can launch it through Steam after doing so. The third option is GOG , but you might want to wait just to buy there: At the time of writing, GOG has just announced th…",

So when I stumbled across the Isometric NYC city map project, I was at first properly stoked—and then deeply conflicted. Isometric NYC is the one-man effort of Andy Coenen, attempting to render all of New York City in an isometric pixel art style distinctly reminiscent of the SimCity series . But rather than laboriously building this city pixel-by-pixel, Coenen has instead leveraged multiple AI agents to create this city map. The entire process required much more work than dashing off a handful of prompts, but you are perhaps beginning to understand my sense of conflict. Coenen himself is a software engineer currently conducting AI research at Google DeepMind . He explains that the original idea for Isometric NYC was to use Google's \" Nano Banana to generate a pixel art map from satellite imagery tile-by-tile,\" though Coenen ultimately used…",

That's according to The Verge , which claims that sources have told them staff are using Anthropic's Claude, alongside Copilot, for AI coding tasks (aka vibe coding). Not that they're making the choice subversively; in fact, the software giant has been happy for its staff to try out various AI coding tools, including its own GitHub Copilot, Anthropic's Claude 4, and OpenAI's GPT-5. Apparently, Microsoft started the whole experiment last year , but just in the developer division, resulting in Claude Sonnet 4 being selected as the AI choice for paid users of GitHub Copilot, though the option to use others is still available. The Verge writes that now any staff member involved in 'Experiences + Devices' (i.e. Windows, Bing, 365, Surface, and so on) is being encouraged to experiment with Claude, even if they have no coding experience at all.

The original ROG Azoth was a triumph that walked the tricky line wonderfully, packing in nice-to-haves such as lubricated switches, reliable wireless connectivity and hot-swappable powers into a smart, compact chassis. This new ROG Azoth 96 HE takes some of what Asus has built up to this point and tears it up. For instance, it's not mechanical in the same sense as its predecessors (or siblings, I suppose), as Asus has opted to go for its ROG HFX V2 Hall effect switches for gaming precision and power, rather than the increased tactility of a traditional mechanical switch. These have been upgraded over the older V1 switches kitted out to other Asus keyboards with Hall effect powers and were first seen on the Asus ROG Falcata , with optimisations such as a shorter overall travel (3.5 mm vs 4 mm) that's more noticeable in use than you'd think, plus a larger magnet for more precise customisation. It's now possible to set the actuation or reset point in increments of 0.01 mm, which is not somet…",

In a YouTube AMA ( spotted by GamesRadar+ ) Downes says he never wants to see AI used to replicate his voice. \"That's where we cross a line that gets into an area that I am uncomfortable with,\" says Downes. \"I'm not a proponent. I don't like it, and I would prefer that it not be done.\" Perhaps conscious that he works in an industry where AI use is increasingly widespread, and does offer limited use cases, Downes does go on to slightly soften his stance outside of the topic of his own voice. AI can have \"many, many positive effects on not only showbusiness but humanity in general\" says Downes, but \"can also be something that deprives the actor of his work. I'll go on the record with that.\" It's not quite Neil Newborn, Astarian in Baldur's Gate 3 among many other things, coming out and saying of AI : \"It's shit… AI sucks.\" But at least it shows…",

Despite the rainbow keyboard and presence of an RTX 5080 GPU, you’ll be surprised to hear this this isn’t a gaming laptop. MSI positions it as “engineered for the demands of STEM professionals,” which probably doesn’t mean gardeners, and then takes a puff on some burning leaves to huskily exhale the phrase “it operates like a high-tech brain”. Yeah, man. The Vector A18 HX may well “deliver the performance and reliability engineers need to excel in every challenge,” but luckily for us it also delivers the kind of frame rates that make PC gamers very happy, and is so obviously a gaming laptop in an unconvincing disguise with its 240 Hz display, seven heat pipes, and two fans to keep it all cool.

I use 'look' in its broadest possible terms, though, because what Rootkid has created isn't a special set of goggles or the like. It's essentially a radio wave transceiver, named Spectrum Slit , that converts the flurry of signals around us into light, emitted by a construction that gives all kinds of Control vibes, for some reason. \"Spectrum Slit is a sculptural installation that renders visible the otherwise imperceptible electromagnetic activity that permeates contemporary interior spaces,\" begins Rootkid. \"While a room may appear visually calm and silent, it is continuously traversed by dense fields of radio-frequency transmissions generated by wireless communication technologies.\" Rootkid describes the full process behind the design, construction, and operation of Spectrum Slit in a seven-minute …",

Well, at least that's how it was in Fable (the old one), but things are changing for Fable (the new one). Speaking to IGN about the upcoming reboot, Playground's founder and general manager Ralph Fulton explained the studio's decision to drop alignment entirely in favour of a reputation system: \"Our morality system is more about shades of gray. It's more about the subjectivity of morality that honestly we see in the world today. There's no objective good, there's no objective evil. You couldn't get everyone in the world to agree that something is evil or something is good. That just doesn't happen. That diversity of opinion I think is really clear these days.\" I would argue that the idea there's no objective evil in the world is maybe a bit much—there's plenty of ways we're all horrible to each other that aren't really up for interpretation.

Anyway, this is all to say that I think the most recent update to the Steam client—itself essentially a packaging of a bunch of fixes that have been pushed to Steam's beta branch recently—is, stealthily, very much about prepping for Valve's black box. I say this because Steam's January 21 client update practically vibrates with controller fixes and updates. Support for the Nintendo Switch 2 wired controller has been re-enabled, there are new settings for joystick responses, fixes for gyro aiming, and plenty else besides (find the full list down below).

I purchased the Peerless Assassin 120 SE V2, a version of the cooler with six heatpipes, for £26. It's currently $33 on Amazon US . Thermalright has around 40,000 variants of any one cooler, all with names using a combination of around ten words, and spanning nine pages on its website . I opted for one of the cheapest available at the time, but if you wanted something prettier, there are many more to choose from. It arrived in a nondescript brown cardboard box, which slightly tempered my expectations for the cooler within. Though I shouldn't have judge a cooler by its box here; it's a mighty impressive unit once you remove it from the packaging. It's much larger than the other budget options I've reviewed recently, including the Arctic Freezer 36 and Cooler Master Hyper 212 Pro . It's a dual-tower cooler, one…",

If you're wondering why that's a big deal, it's not to most gamers . If you have a Windows 11 PC with relatively new hardware, you should be able to enable all with little problem. However, Secure Boot, as shown with the launch of Battlefield 6 , tends to draw criticism. That's for three major reasons. The first is that Secure Boot is a kernel-level security measure, and anti-cheat software that uses it will effectively get privileged access to the inner sanctuary of your PC. Secondly, older machines may not support Secure Boot or might not even have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is used to store cryptographic keys. This means older machines are left in the dust. However, one of the biggest complaints levied at Secure Boot is on behalf of Linux gamers. While Linux does have something called Secure Boot, that's not w…",

In their latest video, Der8auer claims that the OPP is \"basically like a cashback thing where Nvidia tried to actively influence the AIBs and the pricing to make sure that some cards happen on the market and that they are actually being sold by the AIBs for the MSRP.\" Without that incentive scheme in place, Der8auer argues, \"You will have to expect massive price increases across all of these cards. So that means that MSRP that Nvidia communicated in the past basically no longer exists\" Der8auer says they don't know what the OPP actually stands for, but Hardware Luxx argues it to be 'Open Price Program' .

Basically, if something's bothering you—like, say, the recent transmog updates—it's not going to stay that way for long. In case you're unfamiliar, WoW's recently rehashed its transmog (a glamour/outfit system) to work on specific outfits you buy slots for with in-game gold. This has the upshot of not requiring you to visit a transmog specialist every time you get a new piece of gear, while reducing flexibility—due, in part, to the gold cost. Given you'll be saving money on not doing repeat visits to your favourite ethereal, Blizzard reasoned that this new way of doing things ought to be more expensive.

Take a look at the package and you can see two LPDDR5X chips nestled besides the processor. This has benefits for efficiency and size, but has caused some headaches for Intel. One issue from the get-go was price. Extra chips, more packaging steps, and securing memory all add to the cost of production for Lunar Lake versus other chips.

In Intel's Q4 earnings call, the company's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, confirmed the upcoming release window for Nova Lake: \"Along with our next-generation Nova Lake coming at the end of 2026. We now have a client roadmap that combines best-in-class performance with cost-optimized solutions giving me confidence that we are on the path of 45% market share and profitability in both notebooks and desktops over the next several years,\" Tan said (transcript via SeekingAlpha ) Nova Lake could be a big improvement over Arrow lake. I'm not getting my hopes up just yet, but it's rumoured to include a big last level cache (literally called bLLC) that will act as an analogue to 3D V-Cache on AMD Ryzen chips. Moreover, VP John Pitzer said he thought Intel would hold a leadership position with the launch of Nova Lake .

Alas, Armored Core: Mobile 3 is not likely an instalment the masses will embrace. It was originally released for flip phones in 2007, and further complicating matters, it was a Japanese exclusive. While that's not exactly the case now—you can easily go and buy Armored Core: Mobile 3 on Steam right now—few will have the patience to play it without English subs. Indeed, no major efforts have been made to modernize this ancient artefact, though it does appear to have controller support. Here's the trailer: If that's not enough to discourage you, it's pretty cool to have this curio made available again. It takes place between Armored Core Nexus and Armored Core Last Raven, both of which were offshoots of Armored Core 3.

In an interview published by Xbox, Fable game director Ralph Fulton discussed how the studio dealt with taking on a storied series from a once-venerated studio. \"One of the things I said to the team was, ‘Look, we’re not Lionhead—we can’t try to make a Lionhead game.’ This has to be a Playground game because I’m a really firm believer that the personality and the character of a team is visible in the work they do and the games they make.\" Fulton went on: \"And I think you can see Lionhead in that original trilogy. It would be pointless, I think, for us to try and ape that. And that’s really at the heart of the reboot question, right? It felt imperative to me that this was a reboot because we’re starting again as Playground Games, and making Playground’s Fable.\" One sacrosanct part of the Fab…",

The backlash was loud enough that Hypixel CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme hopped onto Twitter to calm everyone down. \"Just want to add a note, the grimoire is NOT the magic system at all,\" Collins-Laflamme posted . \"Seeing reddit go full panic mode thinking this is what we have in mind for magic is kinda insane, this is just a random drop fun item, it will evolve over time,\" he said. I haven't tried out the necromancy system myself yet, but from what I've gathered, players first have to gather physical components by killing skeletons,…",

    "body": "Fable developer Playground Games seems to have its priorities in order: its reimagining of fantasy world Albion is full of beautiful scenery, the tone remains goofy, and there are choices to make that leave an impact on the people around you. More important than all that, though, is that Albion's citizens are each unique, and you can woo every single one of them. \"We maybe once thought we could procedurally generate them,\" Playground founder Ralph Fulton told IGN in an interview . But that idea quickly went out the window as the Fable team decided they \"wanted to craft every one of these NPCs from their name, to their appearance, to their personality traits, to [their] moral worldview … to where they work and where they live and what their family unit is.\" Albion being populated by 1,000 distinct characters is clearly a big talking point for the new Fable, but I got a chuckle out of Fulton bringing up—unprompted!—that you can put a ring on all of them, too. \"You can go and speak to every single one of them in fully voiced conversations,\" he said. \"You could marry... it'll be a bit of work, but you could marry them all.

Upcoming stealth-immersive-platform-brawler-prank sim DreadBound fits the bill. From its first trailer , DreadBound looks to be taking a page from the likes of Dark Messiah of Might & Magic or 2025's best immersive sim, Skin Deep, by embracing the slapstick and improvisational side of the genre, rather than cerebral exploration. In DreadBound's first trailer, I clocked instantly deploying spike traps, oil slicks to trip enemies (or set them on fire), Ravenholm-style circular saw projectiles that you can embed in walls and use as platforms to reach high places, and an homage to my favorite quick melee in all of gaming, the Dark Messiah kick. Rather than the handcrafted levels typical of immersive sims, DreadBound will feature \"a cursed city that changes every time you die.\" That gave this Roguelikephobic gamer some pause, but roguelike and immsim, when attempted in the past, have often proven to be a chocolate and peanut butter genre combo.

The whole thing began when New Blood honcho Dave Oshry said the studio's stealth FPS Blood West saw a 200% increase in sales on Steam while it was available for free on the Epic Games Store over the holidays: \"Turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!\" In response, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney took the high road, saying sometimes Steam comes out on top, sometimes Epic does, \"but one thing is constant on every transaction: gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals.\" That sparked a reaction from Larian Studios publishing chief Michael Douse, who retweeted Sweeney to say that although Epic fully funded the development of Alan Wake 2, keeping the game off of Steam may have done more harm than good in the long run: \"This altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial…",
