Every other week, I'll be sharing my thoughts on the genre, interviewing fellow MMO-heads like me, taking a deep-dive into mechanics we've all taken for granted, and, occasionally, bringing in guest writers to talk about their MMO of choice. There's been some drama in the World of Warcraft community—I know, we live in a wild and mad world—over its overhauled transmog system , and I can't say it's entirely unwarranted. For the completely uninitiated, 'transmog' is a very fancy MMO lingo word for 'playing dressup', and for World of Warcraft: Midnight, Blizzard's changed the entire economy around how it works. Before this week's pre-patch, players could create and save outfits, which would apply a sort of 'new skin' over their existing gear. If they got a new piece of gear, it'd pop up in their currently-equipped item, requiring them to visit an NPC to re-apply the transmog over it again. That old transmog system is gone: In its place, players are now able to create outfits that will not visibly change as new gear is acquired—with a limited amount of slots they need to unlock with gol…",

It might be unfinished, but its anarchic invite-only test has served up better live service than most live service games with its constant reinvention—a habit Deadlock's carried into 2026 with the massive update released Thursday. That update brought a new mode which is almost my favorite way to play the game now... if it weren't for one critical aspect. A normal match of Deadlock is familiar MOBA fare and is therefore extremely stressful. Games usually last between 20 and 45 minutes, and there's very little downtime as teams vie for objectives and farm creeps. Furthermore, every match is ranked⁠—there's no casual queue. Even if you just want to try a new build and unwind, your lackadaisical performance might be mucking up a teammate's chance to get promoted. This environment is fundamentally hostile to the habitual chiller. Most MOBAs have a chiller-friendly mode based on an old custom game tradition: All Random, All Mid. Everyone's hero choice is decided at random, and both teams barrel down a single lane to kill each other and start smashing towers as qu…",

I couldn't have been more wrong. (Image credit: Unfinished Pixel) Blightstone is snappy . I'm thrown right into a battle between my three-man crew (well, technically three men and a dog) and a small group of villagers. Within just a few minutes I've not only gotten to grips with how combat works, I've finished the fight, and I'm onto the next challenge. My brawler, hunter, and arcanist each have two action points per turn to play with. Though they boast substantial hotbars of abilities, it's immediately clear what each one does—here a damaging arrow shot, there a dog attack that inflicts a bleed status effect, etc. It's straightforward but not simple.

As you might expect when a company announces everything is on fire, everything is on fire: as CNBC pointed out a day after the announcement, the company's share price went down by around 34% after the restructuring was announced. When the stock market closed yesterday the price sat at €4.06 (around $4.80) a share. This marks the lowest point in a long downward trajectory going back to 2021 as you can observe on CNBC's website , and it's the lowest share price the company has seen since 2011—the year it reported a $74 million loss .

Give me puzzle doors and weird keys. Give me traps under every flagstone and monsters in every room. The best dungeons are burned into my brain as some of my favourite levels of all time, lurking forever in the shadows of my memory like a gang of 2d4 skeletons. But how well do you remember your years of excursions in the underworld? Our latest quiz tests exactly that, challenging you to match each ominously titled dungeon to its game of origin. Only the kind of seasoned adventurer who knows their Underearth from their Underdark and their Dredmor from their Deadmines will prevail. It's multiple choice, so even when you're stumped you can at least make a guess—but remember that down in the dark, giving the wrong answer to a riddle can have dire consequences… Let us know how you did in the comments below!",

The Killing Stone is a card battler with demonic overtones that owes at least some of its soul to 2021's Inscryption . The meat of the experience is a simulated board-game where you play cards that come to life as little critters. These critters form up in a line on the board, fighting to destroy a lidless eye that represents each player's life. Destroy your opponent's eye and you can move on to the next battle. If your eye gets poked to oblivion on the other hand, well, let's just say the results aren't to your advantage. Surrounding this mechanical core is a narrative meta-layer where you explore the spooky house of an old magus, researching upgrades to improve your chances of beating the game and entreating with its curious denizens.

For PC gamers with one Blood remaster already in their Steam library, the highlight of the package wasn't anything technical—it was the addition of the concluding part of one of Blood's best mods. That mod is Marrow , a new campaign for Monolith's deviously difficult and ferociously violent shooter. It's sort of Blood's equivalent of John Romero's Sigil —a continuation of Blood's storyline that concluded with protagonist Caleb slaying his demonic former master Tchernobog. Like Sigil, Marrow restricts itself to Blood's original assets (weapons, enemies etc) to power the experience, focussing instead on using those assets to build large and complex new maps for the game. Episode One of Marrow has been out for a while, releasing back in 2023. Marrow's creator, Nick Palsmier, intended to issue a general release of Chapter 2 as close to the launch of Nightdive's 2025 remaster as he could. But as he explains in a post on ModDB \"Responsibilities and life got in the way. As did a trickle of small issues.\" Still, it hasn't been that long since Blood: Refres…",

Some of these are fun, quirky spinoffs like Nightmare Kart, while others are more serious efforts to replicate Bloodborne's atmosphere. One of these is side-scrolling soulslike The Last Faith , which aims to do for Bloodborne what Blasphemous did for Catholicism and religious dogma, squeezing out its darkest juices into a 2D, metroidvania-shaped glass. The original game was released back in 2023, but developer Kumi Souls Games just released a new DLC for it. Best of all, it's completely and utterly free.

The full version of No More Room in Hell 2 is definitely happening in 2026, however, and Torn Banner recently provided details on what the 1.0 update will bring. Primarily, that's two new modes, a multiplayer survival mode, and a single-player option for survivalist lone wolves. The former is undoubtedly the main event here. Survival is an alternative to No More Room in Hell 2's Objective mode that saw players converge on a central location from various corners of the map. \"Responders will have to secure objectives then hold out against an onslaught of Zombies with increasing difficulty,\" Torn Banner explains. \"Unlike our current game mode, survival will push our players into fights.\" This mode will apparently include several new maps to play on, which Torn Banner points out are \"more compact than existing objective …",

Highguard was received as a 'one more thing' trespasser that had claimed an unearned seat of honor, although its developer did not pay for the slot as many assumed. The reveal has become a case study in how not to announce a game, but what really got people worked up is what Highguard's developer did next: nothing. Highguard is launching on Steam next week, but the studio still hasn't said anything new about it publicly, aside from a tweet today announcing a livestream. Starved for a new trailer to dunk on in the endless competition to win the social media Cynicism Cup, posters have had to settle for generic declarations of Highguard's cookedness.

But Arknights: Endfield, which just came out this week, isn't your typical anime gacha game. For a lot of players, it's actually a surprisingly robust factory builder with some action RPG combat on the side. Rolling for the most powerful characters is only half the game; the rest is building the most efficient material processing plant you can. Now that everyone's realized what kind of game they're actually playing, someone went and built an entire simulator for designing factory blueprints to share with other players. EndfieldTools is currently getting slammed with traffic because it's the best spot for sharing factory blueprints and testing out layouts without having to waste resources in-game. The factory planner is essentially a simplified version of the real thing with tools to simulate how efficient your setup truly is. I haven't made it far enough in the game to understand a lot of what's available, but I can already see how much easier it is to click and place buildings without having to jump through menu…",

I smashed through Fallout 3 in a week and change over Christmas, I'm getting asymptotically close to the end of a New Vegas run I started in November, and I've put a humiliating number of hours (28.2, according to Steam) into Fallout 4 in just the past five days. My cold take: New Vegas is still my favorite entry in the series, including the 2D originals. My hot take: Fallout 4 is a vastly superior game to Fallout 3, and deserves more credit than it gets in RPG snob circles. The writing is much better than you remember, with more interesting quests and characters than Fallout 3⁠. The color, vibrancy, and general art direction look fresh even 10 years on. The gunplay is so much better and more satisfying than the prior 3D Fallouts, and the weapon customization is a genuine advancement over what you see in New Vegas. This is actually the optimal settlement shape. (Image credit: Bethesda) That's not even getting to the settlement building stuff, which Fallou…",

Players loved that tech demo so much the sim quickly rocketed onto Steam's list of top wishlists, where it now sits in slot number 10 alongside big-budget games like Ark 2 and Forza Horizon 6. Well, sharpen your sword and polish your armor, because Half Sword is ready to spill its guts all over early access: it launches Friday, January 30. That's just next week! To celebrate, the developer, aptly named Half Sword Games, released a comically grisly new trailer set to a soundtrack of what I'll call one of the most delightfully unhinged songs ever written for a game in history. Watch and listen for yourself: The trailer begins with some bare-fisted boxing, but that quickly escalates to people's faces being pulverised on the ground or against wooden posts.

So when I stumbled across the Isometric NYC city map project, I was at first properly stoked—and then deeply conflicted. Isometric NYC is the one-man effort of Andy Coenen, attempting to render all of New York City in an isometric pixel art style distinctly reminiscent of the SimCity series . But rather than laboriously building this city pixel-by-pixel, Coenen has instead leveraged multiple AI agents to create this city map. The entire process required much more work than dashing off a handful of prompts, but you are perhaps beginning to understand my sense of conflict. Coenen himself is a software engineer currently conducting AI research at Google DeepMind . He explains that the original idea for Isometric NYC was to use Google's \" Nano Banana to generate a pixel art map from satellite imagery tile-by-tile,\" though Coenen ultimately used…",

    "body": "Asus first introduced the ROG Azoth range a couple of years ago to straddle the line between traditional gaming keyboards and the more enthusiast-grade options that had skyrocketed in popularity. The original ROG Azoth was a triumph that walked the tricky line wonderfully, packing in nice-to-haves such as lubricated switches, reliable wireless connectivity and hot-swappable powers into a smart, compact chassis. This new ROG Azoth 96 HE takes some of what Asus has built up to this point and tears it up. For instance, it's not mechanical in the same sense as its predecessors (or siblings, I suppose), as Asus has opted to go for its ROG HFX V2 Hall effect switches for gaming precision and power, rather than the increased tactility of a traditional mechanical switch. These have been upgraded over the older V1 switches kitted out to other Asus keyboards with Hall effect powers and were first seen on the Asus ROG Falcata , with optimisations such as a shorter overall travel (3.5 mm vs 4 mm) that's more noticeable in use than you'd think, plus a larger magnet for more precise customisation. It's now possible to set the actuation or reset point in increments of 0.01 mm, which is not somet…",

I don't like it, and I would prefer that it not be done.\" Perhaps conscious that he works in an industry where AI use is increasingly widespread, and does offer limited use cases, Downes does go on to slightly soften his stance outside of the topic of his own voice. AI can have \"many, many positive effects on not only showbusiness but humanity in general\" says Downes, but \"can also be something that deprives the actor of his work. I'll go on the record with that.\" It's not quite Neil Newborn, Astarian in Baldur's Gate 3 among many other things, coming out and saying of AI : \"It's shit… AI sucks.\" But at least it shows…",

An unfair comparison considering the desktop chip doesn’t have to deal with the constrained thermal envelope and limited power draw of a laptop, and the 3D V-Cache really does make a difference. Despite the rainbow keyboard and presence of an RTX 5080 GPU, you’ll be surprised to hear this this isn’t a gaming laptop. MSI positions it as “engineered for the demands of STEM professionals,” which probably doesn’t mean gardeners, and then takes a puff on some burning leaves to huskily exhale the phrase “it operates like a high-tech brain”. Yeah, man. The Vector A18 HX may well “deliver the performance and reliability engineers need to excel in every challenge,” but luckily for us it also delivers the kind of frame rates that make PC gamers very happy, and is so obviously a gaming laptop in an unconvincing disguise with its 240 Hz display, seven heat pipes, and two fans to keep it all cool.

I opted for one of the cheapest available at the time, but if you wanted something prettier, there are many more to choose from. It arrived in a nondescript brown cardboard box, which slightly tempered my expectations for the cooler within.

You will need to enable Secure Boot if you plan on playing through. As we've spotted on the Highguard Steam page , the game needs Secure Boot, TPM 2.0, and Easy Anti-Cheat to run. If you're wondering why that's a big deal, it's not to most gamers . If you have a Windows 11 PC with relatively new hardware, you should be able to enable all with little problem. However, Secure Boot, as shown with the launch of Battlefield 6 , tends to draw criticism. That's for three major reasons. The first is that Secure Boot is a kernel-level security measure, and anti-cheat software that uses it will effectively get privileged access to the inner sanctuary of your PC. Secondly, older machines may not support Secure Boot or might not even have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is used to store cryptographic keys. This means older machines are left in the dust. However, one of the biggest complaints levied at Secure Boot is on behalf of Linux gamers. While Linux does have something called Secure Boot, that's not w…",

It's become overwhelming. Which is why it's reassuring when a publisher takes a hard stance against it, like Manor Lords and Against the Storm publisher Hooded Horse. CEO Tim Bender is \"committed\" to keeping gen AI out of the publisher's games, he says. When Hooded Horse signs devs, it's right there in the contract. \"It's one of those things that we have a union of being aligned with our developers and with players,\" says Bender. \"Players don't, by and large, want gen AI.\" This isn't just a ban on gen AI art in the finished game, but in the earlier stages too. Even studios that wouldn't want to release a game with AI-generated assets will still sometimes use it for placeholders and concept art. As was the case with Sandfall's Clair Obscur— w…",

In their latest video, Der8auer claims that the OPP is \"basically like a cashback thing where Nvidia tried to actively influence the AIBs and the pricing to make sure that some cards happen on the market and that they are actually being sold by the AIBs for the MSRP.\" Without that incentive scheme in place, Der8auer argues, \"You will have to expect massive price increases across all of these cards. So that means that MSRP that Nvidia communicated in the past basically no longer exists\" Der8auer says they don't know what the OPP actually stands for, but Hardware Luxx argues it to be 'Open Price Program' . This is not the only way that AIBs are reportedly encouraged to put out MSRP cards.

Basically, if something's bothering you—like, say, the recent transmog updates—it's not going to stay that way for long. In case you're unfamiliar, WoW's recently rehashed its transmog (a glamour/outfit system) to work on specific outfits you buy slots for with in-game gold. This has the upshot of not requiring you to visit a transmog specialist every time you get a new piece of gear, while reducing flexibility—due, in part, to the gold cost. Given you'll be saving money on not doing repeat visits to your favourite ethereal, Blizzard reasoned that this new way of doing things ought to be more expensive.
