    "body": "Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford took to the stage at this year's Tokyo Game Show to reveal a new Vault Hunter for Borderlands 4, who will be coming out as paid DLC in early 2026.

Or at least, more than the third one did. The new character is a robot who used to work as a dealer at a casino. Disillusioned by the horror of working in a customer-facing service position, C4SH becomes a Vault Hunter with powers based on random chance.

A lot of them present alternate art, with guests like Junji Ito invited to present their own take on iconic cards, though since the best-selling Walking Dead secret lair back in 2020 they've often been crossovers.

    "body": "As reported by Automaton , a survey conducted by the Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA) during June and July found that 51% of Japanese game companies are using AI in some capacity. The survey responses came from CESA member companies , which include the likes of Capcom, Level-5, Square Enix, Sega, and many more spanning major developers and indies alike. The respondents reported using AI for generating visual game assets, story and text generation, and programming assistance. Additionally, 32% of CESA member companies also reported that they are using AI to help develop in-house game engines. There's been a lot of high-level discussion and grand statements about generative AI's potential use in gaming, but it's surprising just how much of a foothold it already has, at least in Japan. Some CESA members have been open about using AI, as Automaton points out, including Level-5 and Capcom . For instance, Level-5 is using it pretty extensively in everything from visual upscaling to character creation to code generation. The potential uses for generative AI in gaming vary drastically, though, just like opinions on it. Using AI to speed up repetitive coding or animatio…",

The fighting game-inspired platformer arrives on November 11, just a brisk year and a half after its June 2024 announcement . I got a first look at Possessor(s) in action earlier this year, but was not able to try it hands on. I liked what I saw though: Earnest storytelling inspired by early aughts anime dubs, slick combat with the promise of juggling, parries, and tricky bosses, plus some gorgeous character and environment art. That last bit is something I'm particularly excited about with Possessor(s): I find a lot of Metroid-style platformers can have overly abstracted, gamey environments. Hollow Knight and Silksong do a great job of avoiding this, with each area having a real tangible feeling and deep environmental storytelling. I also have to hand it to Metroid Dread on this front, a game that otherwise left me cold. Possessor(s) really sells the illusion of a ruined city over its platforming gauntlets, and I'm eager to see more. As for combat, you can only glean so much without trying something hands on, but Possessor(s) looks propulsive and fun, …",

Some of this content was made available to players who only purchased the regular standard version of Silent Hill f. While it's unclear how much of the exclusive content leaked to standard edition players, several people on the Silent Hill subreddit reported getting access to exclusive outfits, but not the soundtrack or other bonuses. Before you get too excited about free in-game items, it doesn't look like Konami will let the mix-up slide. A post on the official Silent Hill X (formerly Twitter) account addressed the situation on Friday, stating, \"We’re investigating an issue on the Steam version of Silent Hill f where bonus and pre-order content not included in the purchased edition is temporarily accessible.

There will also be a new copper golem mob that autonomously organizes items you leave in copper chests into nearby regular chests. Like other copper items, the golems can oxidize and change color over time. While I wish I could have made all of those copper items when the ore was first added to the game in 2021, better late than never. Copper tools and gear have been in Java mods for a while now, so it's nice to see them officially added to the vanilla version. Copper is much easier to find early on in a new Minecraft world than iron, so this update will make it easier to gear up right after spawning into a new game. While it's pretty time consuming mining and smelting copper for building, its abundance at surface level in the overworld makes it perfect for crafting starting gear. The…",

The culture is really about focusing on what we have and if we have a really good idea or have a really good thought, it should go into the game we're making.\" As it stands, Supergiant is still focused on supporting Hades 2, even after releasing its 1.0 version. \"The response to the game is an important part of the experience of making it.

Over the course of its 30 years in the industry, BioWare has developed some of the best and most memorable RPGs of all time. Though its present success may be a little in doubt, that legacy remains an astonishing addition to videogame canon. Which is why I expect you to remember it all, down to every last title. Today's quiz is simple—you just have to name every game BioWare has ever made. To be clear, that's only games it developed itself, and only ones that actually released—no cancelled projects. But to warn you, it does include some games that didn't come out on PC. I'm afraid you do have to remember the one time they made an RPG for a Nintendo handheld. And just to make it a bit trickier, you've got to do it in two minutes. Ready? Scroll down to the quiz below to start. Let us know how you did in the comments!",

    "body": "Fans of The Witcher 3 may have fallen in love with Gwent when CD Projekt's masterful RPG launched in 2015, but I personally lamented the loss of the original minigame from the series—Dice Poker. I always thought Gwent was too much of a commitment for a minigame contained within a 300-hour RPG, and preferred the simpler, more intuitive fun of rolling high-scoring poker hands with fistfuls of dice seen in the first two games. While it's unlikely we'll ever see Dice Poker get an official spinoff in the way Gwent did , it does finally have its own dedicated roguelike. Dead Finger Dice is an Inscryption -ish mix of digital tabletop gaming and spooky narrative puzzling, with a gnarly twist where you use your character's fingers as betting currency. The premise is that you've been kidnapped and imprisoned aboard The Avarice, a luxury yacht inhabited by bloodthirsty demonic billionaires. These sadistic superrich monsters, who include Nosferatu-ish vampires and snake-headed Medusas among their ranks, force you to play games of Dice Poker, where you get five dice and four rolls to achieve the highest-scoring poker-hand you can. In the betting system, each player can bet multiple fingers per…",

That this DLC primarily adds a dog to help you batter baddies in cramped conditions is, if anything, a pleasant bonus. For the uninitiated, Fights in Tight Spaces takes the tactical layer of games like X-COM and replaces the aliens with a heavy dose of John Wick. Playing as suave silhouette Agent 11, each level places you in an isometric, turn-based action scenario filled with monochromatic goons, then deals you a handful of martial-arts themed playing cards. You need to play the cards to take out your opponents in the most efficient way possible. It's a straightforward premise, but one sleekly presented and with more depth than you might expect. The DLC, named K9 Division , adds a helpful hound into the game's card-based brawls. According to developer Ground Shatter, this involves more than just an extra character to play with. While Agent K can fight on their own terms using an array of dog specific moves such as biting enemies, intimidating…",

There was certainly potential in running around playing janitor within the brutalist interdimensional nexus known as The Oldest House. But Remedy's cooperative shooter simply didn't feel ready for action, as I discovered in my FBC: Firebreak review . It was too lean, too repetitive, too unbalanced, and lacked some fundamental features like a proper tutorial. Remedy has spent the last few months plugging holes in Firebreak's leaky hull, but the latest patch, which arrives next week, represents the studio's first proper attempt to turn the ship around. The dramatically named Breakpoint update seems, on paper, to represent a complete overhaul of Firebreak's core experience, while also adding a whole new mission and a bunch of smaller features, too. At the heart of Breakpoint is a total rework of how missions are selected. The Jobs board—from which players picked a mission to play and then customised its difficulty and length—has been hacked to splinters with a fire axe and tossed into a skip. It's replaced by a 'Crises' board that offers a tailored selection of Jobs with preset lengths that refresh every 30 m…",

The main impression I got from playing about half-an-hour of Ananta at this year's Tokyo Game Show was: Wow it must have taken a lot of people to make this game!

The group of investors reportedly includes the private equity firm Silver Lake and the government of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The deal could be announced as early as next week, and would be the largest leveraged buyout ever recorded. A leveraged buyout is when a private equity firm uses a significant amount of borrowed money to seal the deal, with the asset set to be acquired used as collateral in the debt. This effectively leaves the acquired company liable for the debt⁠—if its income can't adequately service the debt, it will bear the consequences of a default, not the investors who made the purchase, and that usually means closures and layoffs.

According to YouTuber Kilroy Was Here , there is apparently a specific set of speedrunning tricks you can perform that will lock protagonist Hornet in jail with no escape and no way to continue the game. Plenty of players have already been to The Slab , a prison area you get taken to after being captured by a specific enemy early in the game. It's a scary place that strips you of your gear and forces you to fight your way out with your bare hands and basic movement abilities. Parts of Silksong can be cruel, but Team Cherry at least designed it so you can't be imprisoned unless you've progressed far enough into the game to have the tools you need to escape. Or so we thought. Kilroy found a way to get there without those tools, sentencing poor Hornet to life in bug prison. \"I don't know why anyone would want to do this, but I have done it anyway,\" the YouTube description reads. \"Rest in peace Hornet.\" Sending Ho…",

Presented via Steam news post, the new mechanic is the \"tumble grab.\" When the update drops, you'll be able to latch onto things even after you've flung your condensed little trashcan body. Once the red outlines on the edges of the screen turn yellow, you can grab weapons and items—and even the level geometry. While tumble grabbing, your beam will be able to grapple onto any surface. That means you can, with some finesse, climb up walls and across the ceiling by flinging your tumbling body. Your tumble grabbing ability is tied to your stamina, however, so there's at least going to be one limiting factor preventing complete wall-climbing chaos. \"Tumble Grab also means that you can grab stuff in situations you previously couldn’t,\" Semiwork said. \"For example, if you’re levitated by the vicious Mentalist, you can grab a weapon and fight back!\" Semiwork demonstrated the power of the tumble grab in an accompanying video .

Path of Exile 2's 0.3 update, The Third Edict, came out at the end of August to warm reception . Introducing Act 4 released us from the hell of running Acts 1-3 twice whenever we want to level a character, the Abyss mechanic is fun and rewarding, and in general the community has been happy with the direction of the game. One thorny issue that continues to plague PoE2, however, is the endgame. Currently, in order to juice our maps and for the best rewards, we have to navigate the Atlas of Worlds until we find a spot with multiple overlapping towers. The more towers, the more slots we have for tablets, the more loot we get. This leads to a problem where all the maps we run that don't have multiple towers near them feel like wasting time, something to slog through unt…",

But it does get better, especially once you realise that you can just ignore most of the monsters you come across. I'm something of a magpie and a hoarder in survival horror games, which means that I collect every single item I come across and then never want to use them. So my solution to this has always been to rely on being as sneaky as possible and perfecting the art of the dodge. And just like most survival games, it works a charm: I found every single note, letter, item, and omamori in Silent Hill f, and I hardly killed a thing. (Image credit: Konami) One of the benefits of Silent Hill f being a third-person horror game is that you can play corners; I used this to check corners and alleyways before I walked around or past them. Not only did this save me from getting jumped by knife-wielding mannequins, but it also meant I could see when an enemy was approaching and then wait until it went past to make a move to the next location…",

You'll find new items and notes in every subsequent playthrough and even find new cutscenes as you progress through the narrative.

Today, it seems those artists haven't been looking terribly far afield, because Blizzard's doing some good old-fashioned franchise synergizing by putting Starcraft skins in Diablo 4. In a blog post published yesterday, Blizzard revealed a series of new cosmetics that bring a Starcraft-themed armor set for each Diablo 4 class. And I won't blame you for cocking an eyebrow: It's not the first time Sanctuary's seen crossover cosmetics from another Blizzard IP—D4's gotten multiple rounds of Warcraft skins—but Azeroth's spiky fantasy armor feels like an easier fit for Diablo's gothic palette than Starcraft's scifi soldiers and aliens. (Image credit: Activison Blizzard) Still, while I'm generally opposed to Activision-Blizzard's history of melting down the visual identities of its games into a homogeneous slurry, I'll admit: You can apparently make a pretty decent Barbarian armor set out of a Terran marine.

It's got all the same moody anime girl energy of Arcaea but with a fully fleshed out visual novel portion and some wicked-looking song charts to go alongside it. Gameplay looks like it'll be taking an Osu approach with a dual keyboard-and-mouse input system—four central lanes and two side lanes along with flick-style aerial notes that float above the main field. It looks a little similar to Lowiro's mobile gameplay, with a little bit of the arcadeyness from Sound Voltex and Ongeki in there to boot. For the visual novel portion, In Falsus will follow five different high school girls as their stories intertwine: Nia Cana, Mei Alder, Ayame Takatsuki, Iris Leal, and Story Étienne.

Speaking with TheGameBusiness at Gamescom, Bellamy reiterated that Jagex is still on that straight (pun not intended) and narrow: \"The team have been looking at the way the product currently is, the happiness of players, where they're finding frustration… If we believe this game has another 25 years, what do we need to change? And monetization is near the top of that list.\" These included \"experiments\"—temporary removals or adjustments to certain microtransaction systems to make them, well, less bad: \"Treasure hunter is our microtransaction layer, and we did the total removal of that temporarily. That hasn't been done since it was implemented in 2012.\" Kudos where kudos are due, Bellamy seems open to the idea that his company might make less money for a while: \"We probably won't maintain the revenue that we currently are when we make these changes.

That's according to a report by the Wall Street Journal , which claims that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has already mooted the idea with various executives within America's semiconductor industry. If we use Nvidia as an example, it currently relies almost exclusively on companies outside of the US for all the chips and other electronic components that are used to manufacture its graphics cards and AI data servers. Its GPUs and CPUs are made by TSMC in Taiwan, with circuit boards and the host of parts that are fitted to them produced in China.

Called Uprising, it seems like RGG Studio's attempt at delving into a more modern fighting game formula with \"dynamic momentum-shifting opportunities,\" according to the presentation. These opportunities come in the form of new mechanics Flowguard, Break and Rush, and the Stunner and Stun Combo systems. The first is a \"new defensive system designed with stylish movements,\" which RGG Studio says \"expands options and introduces fresh dynamics for offense and defense beyond traditional guarding.\" Flowguard's defensive options are closely tied to Break and Rush, which seems to be the main selling point behind Uprising. It's essentially a part break system—repeatedly damaging the same body parts—like the head, body, and legs—will eventually open up huge vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to gain access to \"powerful offensive o…",

In the latest 1.618 version, Agility now supports Advanced Shader Delivery, which was announced last month . The rather unassuming name is for a complex database system that will hopefully be the ultimate solution to all problems relating to shader compilation. Modern 3D graphics involve tens of thousands of different shaders, and APIs such as DirectX, Vulkan, or Metal generate them in a common format.
