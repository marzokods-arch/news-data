I've had an adverse reaction to the start of every Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Demon Souls, proclaiming to anyone who'd listen that I'd never touch any of these games again, only to then put hundreds of hours into them. I'm nothing if not consistent. Elden Ring Nightreign was no different in this respect. Dropped into the chaos that is Limveld, I had no idea what was going on or why I had just spawned next to one of the Godskin duo at an evergaol. It was a rough entry into the game, and I hated it, but then I played another round and started to join the dots together. Snap to 200 hours later, and I had beaten all the Nightlords and their Everdark variants, but games were strangely easy. (Image credit: FromSoftware) Well, FromSoft must've heard all my bragging because the latest DLC, Forsaken Hollows, launched last week, and it's rough. I've been repeatedly stomped on by the two new nightlords, the Balancers and Dreglord, whether I'm playing one of the new nightfarers or not. I can't even get past the second night boss sometimes—why is that Demon Prince so angry…",

Getting into a shoot-out if you're in squads isn't necessarily a death sentence, especially if you have some seasoned raiders on your side, but it can usually get pretty messy if you're in solos. I'm telling you this from experience.

    "body": "Philips and its sister brand AOC are claiming a world's first in gaming monitor tech. The Philips Evnia 27M2N5500XD and AOC AGON Pro AGP277QK are both 500 Hz 1440p gaming panels with 1,000 Hz alternative 1080p modes. Size-wise, we're talking 27 inches. The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix. So, in terms of HDR support, these are entry-level panels and won't have local dimming. It's also worth noting that t…",

A number of optional color palettes gave it a bit more pep, like the wine-tinged Bordeaux or the more sophisticated teal of Designer. And then there was Hot Dog Stand, which more or less turned Windows into a carnival. \"The truly funny thing about this color scheme is that all the other Windows 3.1 color schemes are surprisingly rational, totally reasonable color schemes,\" tech blogger Jeff Atwood wrote back in 2005 . \"And then you get to 'Hot Dog Stand. Which is utterly insane . … I have to think it was included as a joke.\" If you read the comments to Atwood's article, you'll see some speculation that it's actually great if you're color blind, and then you'll see that speculation debunked.

The \"work in progress\" video purports to be a recording of a display screen, rather than a direct capture, so the quality isn't great and, more importantly, it's trickier to suss out whether it's AI generated. But it has long-suffering Shenmue fans hopeful: It's been six years since Shenmue 3 dropped (which happened a full 18 years after Shenmue 2), and while Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has previously expressed a desire to make a new game in the series , there's been no movement toward that actually happening.

Path of Exile 2, however, could be the game at the end of Rogers' \"quest to make the perfect ARPG,\" he told PC Gamer in a recent interview. Despite its differences to PoE 1, some of which have gone away over the last year in early access, \"it was never really about making it feel distinct,\" he says. In the last year, Grinding Gear Games has been navigating the treacherous waters of making a sequel that veers pretty far away from the vibe of the first game. If PoE 1 is a rampage through thousands of monsters, PoE 2 is a dance with far fewer, but more threatening monsters—a fundamental shift in the feel of the game. And not everyone has been a fan of the pivot, especially when any class that feels remotely like PoE 1 inevitably gets gutted in a patch. PoE 1 veterans want to feel like gods and go fast in the new game; Rogers wants combat to feel methodical. …",

It was immediately clear that Wiebe loves Portal. He worked on the first iteration of Battlefield 6's level editing/publishing platform during Battlefield 2042 development, back when the toolset was, in his words, \"more like a Battlefield builder than anything.\" In that game, Portal was squarely focused on mashing up different eras of Battlefield. You could pit futuristic jets versus WW2 planes, summon bots, and tweak rules to your heart's content, but without complex scripting or the ability to place new geometry, its creative ceiling was low. \"The people were phenomenal at stretching what we had built to do some amazing things, but they had to really work hard,\" Wiebe told PC Gamer.

As I write this, the third Bullet Heaven Festival is running on Steam until December 11, offering discounts on all manner of games where you stand in the middle of the screen as everything around you is macerated by a blender of weaponized particle effects. In addition to discounts, the organizers of the third-party sale have also organized a public poll to help canonize a communally agreed-upon name for the genre that—until now—has been scattered across a smattering of tangentially-relevant Steam tags.

There is some seriously funny stuff here, in particular an AI 'girlfriend' who ends up calling the host a \"jerk\" before walking off while saying \"it's so good I can actually storm off now.\" But what we're concerned with happens around 10 minutes in ( timestamp ), in a section called \"how far would AI go?\" in these military contexts. First, let's be clear about what we're about to watch. The robots used in the video are supplied by Scan 3XS, a PC and robotics specialist. The model being used in the gun test appears to be the Unitree G1 , which will set you back a cool £21,000 / $28,000.

Kojima's been doing a round of interviews to see out the year, and the latest with the Japanese outlet Ananweb sees him reflecting on all of these game projects. As ever, Kojima says he doesn't think of Death Stranding 2 as \"finished\" because \"I actually wanted to continue until around September.\" Kojima says that the studio's games \"have to be unique and sell to a certain extent. This is difficult. Our previous game, Death Stranding, was too unique, so we had to carefully adjust the balance to broaden the audience for this one.\" The example he gives is a snowy mountain that's twice as high as anything in the previous game: \"When we gathered monitors and played it for the first time, everyone…",

Verified Link: Steam There's a simple reason: I never trusted I could do it without exploding my whole skeleton. Nevertheless I behold the skateboard with a kind of talismanic reverence. It's an implement that grants a different relationship with our earthly geometry. Skating is an almost occultic discipline, its practitioners defying worldly convention to dabble in transcendent matters of slope, rotation, and bodily contortion. Skate Story takes that to an extreme. If Dante Alighieri had known that skateboarding could be a weapon of metaphysical rebellion against hell and reality itself, his Inferno would also have followed a \"demon made of glass and pain\" who's entered into a contract with the Devil to eat the moon in exchange for their soul. Skate Story is one of the best-sounding and most stylish games I've played in recent memory. It's an…",

As someone who was skeptical of the value of the Expedition in Arc Raiders at first, I'm more surprised than anyone that I actually kind of like Embark's approach to the rewards now it's revealed what we're getting . You earn a special bragging rights skin for completing the base Expedition , along with 12 slots of permanent extra stash space, but also temporary boosts to XP, repairs, and Scrappy materials next season. In a sense, you trade all of this for the things you lose, such as blueprints, quest progress, and workbench upgrades. We also get up to five skill points above the level cap for every new Raider we start, at the cost of $1 million per point in coins and stash value when the Expedition leaves. Now, yes, that is an astonishing amount of money, but I think it achieves the balance of what a Prestige mechanic is supposed to be about.

Allegedly stated in two internal memos seen by Business Insider, Meta is reportedly pushing back the glasses to \"get the details right\". These memos are said to state that Meta needs \"breathing room\" in order to put out a \"fully polished\" device. It was originally suggested to launch in the latter half of 2026. Reports suggest Meta's MR glasses are a bit closer to goggles and even come with a power puck, like the Apple Vision Pro. If true, this would tether the device somewhat but could also allow for a more lightweight feel in the headset itself.

Still, the foundation has been laid for your apps to update themselves thanks to the introduction of the Unified Update Orchestration Platform (UOP). The UOP will \"download and install updates based on user activity and system state\". Though rather than Windows Update, which provides patches for the OS and some applications and services, or Microsoft Store, UOP allows apps to stick to their own backend updating service. So, think of it like the OS helping apps to download updates when the system isn't in use. Apps need to be registered to the UOP via an API, but once done, they can stay up-to-date without monitoring. In a Microsoft blog back in May this year, product manager Angie Chen said UOP is a \"Unified future for app updates\", as it will work with both Windows and non-Windows apps. Windows will then provide a unified app update history for all updates on the system, so all in one place. (Image credit: Microsoft) As of right now, no apps actually utilise UOP, but users on the Dev and Beta channels will slowly start to get access.

Aside from the obvious lack of microphone for game chat, it's also not the most portable headset for gaming on the go. So in an attempt to remedy this, Beyer has introduced a lighter, closed back headphone with an easily detachable cable that can work both 3.5mm and USB-C. The new, smaller, Beyerdynamic DT 270 Pro can't beat my beloved DT 900 Pro X in sheer performance and comfort but it can certainly pack down into my backpack a helluva lot easier while still giving me that sweet, sweet Beyerdynamic sound. The design language is pure Beyerdynamic minimalism. Matte black cups, spring-steel headband, understated padding—no RGB strips, no gamer logos, nothing you'd be embarrassed to wear out and about.

He announced his retirement in a lengthy X post , saying that 2025 would be his final year at Bandai Namco and as the project leader on Tekken. \"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I've devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close,\" he wrote. A good chunk of the post is dedicated to his interactions with the community over the last three decades. \"My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas,\" he said. \"I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.\" Harada said that those experiences \"became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator,\" something which continued even as both Tekken and the FGC at large grew bigger. \"Many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for…",

But did you know exactly how much spoken dialogue, down to the very second? Well, one fan, who seems to've done the legwork, is able to answer that question: 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds. User Everwhite-moonlight on the Baldur's Gate 3 subreddit has compiled a spreadsheet that tallies not only the hours spoken by each character (and their respective voice actor), but also the amount of files they speak in. For example, Amelia Tyler, who voices the game's silk-toned narrator, is understandable top billing at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds of chatting—over a brain-boggling 7,629 files. Hilariously, Astarion takes the prize for biggest yapper in all of Baldur's Gate, just one hour shy of beating out the main character's literal inner monologue: 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. Larian's work is even more impressive when Everwhite-moonlight tallies it up, though: \"There are about 173,642 voice files in the game with the combine…",

Overwatch 2 Season 20 release date and time OW2 Season 20 begins on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, at 11 am PT / 2 pm EST / 7 pm GMT , which coincides with the usual update time for the game in your region.

Skarven's first trailer is all mood and light on action. The player approaches a lonely country house with an industrial mill looming behind. In Danish, a TV anchor drops some crumbs of world building as the player creeps through the house: We're seeing a rising retirement age and increased labor automation thanks to a Children of Men-style bottoming out in fertility rates. We pick up a chunky, Fallout 10mm-looking pistol, the TV cuts out, and a freaky, Nihilanth -type dude pops out to attack. I'm digging what I see, including an oppressive northern European dreariness, some great sci-fi/alt history scene setting, and stellar art direction, which pairs Mathorne's style with early aughts, PS2 vibes, but \"how you remember it.\" I'm reminded of Nightdive's approach to the System Shock Remake, which boasted high-fidelity assets paired with deliberately noisy, pixelated textures.

And what better fodder for my super chill, super relaxing playlist than videogame music? After all, its entire purpose is to create ambience. It's vibes personified. Instead of telling you how it's feeling, it's trying to tell you how you should feel. Ooh, don't you feel so fuzzy and nostalgic as I play the flute in this quaint woodland village? Isn't the sul ponticello on this violin making you scared? You get my point.

The game's recent remaster, Guild Wars Reforged , launched Wednesday as a free update for existing players and an inexpensive way to get in for newbies.

That may not sound like a lot, but it's floated for the last several years at around 200-600, and since the game came to Steam relatively late in its life, there's likely a big contingent of people playing on the standalone client available on ArenaNet's website (anecdotally, that's how I play both Guild Wars games when the mood strikes).
