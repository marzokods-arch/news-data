The Philips Evnia 27M2N5500XD and AOC AGON Pro AGP277QK are both 500 Hz 1440p gaming panels with 1,000 Hz alternative 1080p modes. Size-wise, we're talking 27 inches. The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix. So, in terms of HDR support, these are entry-level panels and won't have local dimming. It's also worth noting that t…",

Netherite horse armor takes a significant amount of work, but it's well worth it. If you're bringing the same horse out each time you adventure, you'll want to keep it safe, and given the fact netherite is the strongest material in the game, it'll more than do the trick. Unlike all other armor, netherite has no durability either, so you know that once you've made it, you probably won't have to again, which is a huge plus for the material. You can also equip it on any adult horse, including zombie horses, which come with their own added perk. So, if you're convinced to give the craft a go, here's how you can make it. How to craft netherite horse armour in Minecraft (Image credit: Mojang) If you want to get ahold of netherite horse armor in Minecraft, you'll need a set of diamond horse armor first . Take the armor, a netherite ingot, and a netherite upgrade to a smithing table in order to craft the netherite horse armor. When equipped to a horse, this will provide 19 armor points, 3 armor toughness, and 10% knockback resistance. Wh…",

    "body": "Minecraft has answered the prayers of anyone looking for a longer-reach melee weapon rather than relying on the bow. That's right, the spear is here courtesy of the Mounts of Mayhem drop, and don't let its simplicity fool you—there's a lot to love about this little weapon. Working out how to craft a spear is incredibly easy, depending on which material you want to use for it, but it can be a little tricky to master its moveset. It packs a serious punch within its attacks, and requires a little more training than just swinging a sword around. Here's everything you need to know about how to create one and how you can make the most of its moves. How to craft a spear in Minecraft (Image credit: Mojang) To craft a spear in Minecraft, you need two sticks and your chosen material. Place one stick in the bottom left corner, one in the middle row and center square, plus your material in the top right corner. It's essential that these materials are placed diagonally, since if you place them vertically, you'll end up with a shovel which won't do much damage to your enemies. Much like every other tool in Minecraft, there are various different forms for you to choose from, but since wood is th…",

If you've been waiting for an excuse to finally explore underwater, then finding a Nautilus might be your key to success. But, much like a lot of Minecraft's underwater mobs, they can be quite challenging to track down, let alone tame. With how much of a Minecraft world is covered in ocean, tracking a Nautilus can seem quite intimidating. However, there's actually a pretty solid method you can follow if you're stuck on where to start looking. Here's what you need to do if you want to get an underwater mount for yourself, and how you can tame it once and for all. Where to find Nautilus in Minecraft Nautilus spawn in all ocean biomes in Minecraft, including frozen and warm, which makes the job of hunting one down a little easier. With that said, they don't appear at the surface, and you'll have to delve beyond level 38 to find one . Fortunately, they tend to spawn in groups of two or three, so if you find one, the chances you'll encounter a few extra to tame are high too. As is the way with all of Minecraft's underwater mobs, th…",

Back in the day Windows was pretty plain looking out of the box, with grey windows and blue highlights as the default. A number of optional color palettes gave it a bit more pep, like the wine-tinged Bordeaux or the more sophisticated teal of Designer. And then there was Hot Dog Stand, which more or less turned Windows into a carnival. \"The truly funny thing about this color scheme is that all the other Windows 3.1 color schemes are surprisingly rational, totally reasonable color schemes,\" tech blogger Jeff Atwood wrote back in 2005 . \"And then you get to 'Hot Dog Stand. Which is utterly insane . … I have to think it was included as a joke.\" If you read the comments to Atwood's article, you'll see some speculation that it's actually great if you're color blind, and then you'll see that speculation debunked. You'll also find a comment from a year later, in 2006, claiming that the creator of the scheme \"presented a great seminar on UI design\" at a conference in 1997. \"She claimed that Hot Dog was a cha…",

The \"work in progress\" video purports to be a recording of a display screen, rather than a direct capture, so the quality isn't great and, more importantly, it's trickier to suss out whether it's AI generated. But it has long-suffering Shenmue fans hopeful: It's been six years since Shenmue 3 dropped (which happened a full 18 years after Shenmue 2), and while Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has previously expressed a desire to make a new game in the series , there's been no movement toward that actually happening. It sure sounds like that remains the case. \"Ys Net Inc has confirmed that a video has been posted on social media which uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that it is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us,\" the studio wrote on X. \"This video has absolu…",

Path of Exile 2, however, could be the game at the end of Rogers' \"quest to make the perfect ARPG,\" he told PC Gamer in a recent interview. Despite its differences to PoE 1, some of which have gone away over the last year in early access, \"it was never really about making it feel distinct,\" he says. In the last year, Grinding Gear Games has been navigating the treacherous waters of making a sequel that veers pretty far away from the vibe of the first game. If PoE 1 is a rampage through thousands of monsters, PoE 2 is a dance with far fewer, but more threatening monsters—a fundamental shift in the feel of the game. And not everyone has been a fan of the pivot, especially when any class that feels remotely like PoE 1 inevitably gets gutted in a patch. PoE 1 veterans want to feel like gods and go fast in the new game; Rogers wants combat to feel methodical. …",

It was immediately clear that Wiebe loves Portal. He worked on the first iteration of Battlefield 6's level editing/publishing platform during Battlefield 2042 development, back when the toolset was, in his words, \"more like a Battlefield builder than anything.\" In that game, Portal was squarely focused on mashing up different eras of Battlefield. You could pit futuristic jets versus WW2 planes, summon bots, and tweak rules to your heart's content, but without complex scripting or the ability to place new geometry, its creative ceiling was low. \"The people were phenomenal at stretching what we had built to do some amazing things, but they had to really work hard,\" Wiebe told PC Gamer.

Oh yeah, there's also the three other games the company has in development: horror title OD, espionage game PhysInt, and an untitled collaboration with Niantic (of Pokemon GO fame). Kojima's been doing a round of interviews to see out the year, and the latest with the Japanese outlet Ananweb sees him reflecting on all of these game projects. As ever, Kojima says he doesn't think of Death Stranding 2 as \"finished\" because \"I actually wanted to continue until around September.\" Kojima says that the studio's games \"have to be unique and sell to a certain extent. This is difficult. Our previous game, Death Stranding, was too unique, so we had to carefully adjust the balance to broaden the audience for this one.\" The example he gives is a snowy mountain that's twice as high as anything in the previous game: \"When we gathered monitors and played it for the first time, everyone…",

Verified Link: Steam There's a simple reason: I never trusted I could do it without exploding my whole skeleton. Nevertheless I behold the skateboard with a kind of talismanic reverence. It's an implement that grants a different relationship with our earthly geometry. Skating is an almost occultic discipline, its practitioners defying worldly convention to dabble in transcendent matters of slope, rotation, and bodily contortion. Skate Story takes that to an extreme. If Dante Alighieri had known that skateboarding could be a weapon of metaphysical rebellion against hell and reality itself, his Inferno would also have followed a \"demon made of glass and pain\" who's entered into a contract with the Devil to eat the moon in exchange for their soul. Skate Story is one of the best-sounding and most stylish games I've played in recent memory. It's an…",

You earn a special bragging rights skin for completing the base Expedition , along with 12 slots of permanent extra stash space, but also temporary boosts to XP, repairs, and Scrappy materials next season. In a sense, you trade all of this for the things you lose, such as blueprints, quest progress, and workbench upgrades. We also get up to five skill points above the level cap for every new Raider we start, at the cost of $1 million per point in coins and stash value when the Expedition leaves.

Allegedly stated in two internal memos seen by Business Insider, Meta is reportedly pushing back the glasses to \"get the details right\". These memos are said to state that Meta needs \"breathing room\" in order to put out a \"fully polished\" device. It was originally suggested to launch in the latter half of 2026. Reports suggest Meta's MR glasses are a bit closer to goggles and even come with a power puck, like the Apple Vision Pro. If true, this would tether the device somewhat but could also allow for a more lightweight feel in the headset itself. With the current state of AI, and worries around privacy that come from someone being able to capture or stream any moment for any reason, I don't think I'm particularly excited for a world with more smart glasses in it.

Starsand Island reminds me a whole lot of the Rune Factory games—janky 3D animations galore, anime art out the wazoo but with a charming Eastern vibe that makes me overlook the weirdness that seems to inevitably come from adding a third dimension to farming sims these days. (Image credit: XSeed Games) I was given a map, a rickety small farm, and a whole lotta freedom from minute one which was mighty refreshing. No going around introducing myself to every Tom, Dick, and Harry on the island. There's just a bit of hand-holding with some introductory quests, and the encouragement to go and become certified in a number of professions. These professions cover the standard go-to farming sim stuff: farming, exploration, crafting, fishing, and ranching. Each one is headed up by a mentor—and oh, god dammit, I'm going around the island introducing myself to everybody without even realising. Th…",

    "body": "Good news, an actually good Windows update is here. But it likely won't be useful for a while. Still, the foundation has been laid for your apps to update themselves thanks to the introduction of the Unified Update Orchestration Platform (UOP). The UOP will \"download and install updates based on user activity and system state\". Though rather than Windows Update, which provides patches for the OS and some applications and services, or Microsoft Store, UOP allows apps to stick to their own backend updating service. So, think of it like the OS helping apps to download updates when the system isn't in use. Apps need to be registered to the UOP via an API, but once done, they can stay up-to-date without monitoring. In a Microsoft blog back in May this year, product manager Angie Chen said UOP is a \"Unified future for app updates\", as it will work with both Windows and non-Windows apps. Windows will then provide a unified app update history for all updates on the system, so all in one place. (Image credit: Microsoft) As of right now, no apps actually utilise UOP, but users on the Dev and Beta channels will slowly start to get access.

Its MMX 330 Pro cans are supremely comfortable, the open-back design with STELLAR.45 drivers makes games, music, and everything in between sound phenomenal. But it's not perfect. Aside from the obvious lack of microphone for game chat, it's also not the most portable headset for gaming on the go. So in an attempt to remedy this, Beyer has introduced a lighter, closed back headphone with an easily detachable cable that can work both 3.5mm and USB-C. The new, smaller, Beyerdynamic DT 270 Pro can't beat my beloved DT 900 Pro X in sheer performance and comfort but it can certainly pack down into my backpack a helluva lot easier while still giving me that sweet, sweet Beyerdynamic sound. The design language is pure Beyerdynamic minimalism. Matte black cups, spring-steel headband, understated padding—no RGB strips, no gamer logos, nothing you'd be embarrassed to wear out and about. Though, while I wouldn't say it feels cheap, it certainly lacks the panache of its more expensive siblings. At just 194 grams, it feels impossibly light compared to most gaming headsets, yet it barely shifts on your head du…",

A good chunk of the post is dedicated to his interactions with the community over the last three decades. \"My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas,\" he said. \"I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.\" Harada said that those experiences \"became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator,\" something which continued even as both Tekken and the FGC at large grew bigger. \"Many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for…",

But did you know exactly how much spoken dialogue, down to the very second? Well, one fan, who seems to've done the legwork, is able to answer that question: 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds. User Everwhite-moonlight on the Baldur's Gate 3 subreddit has compiled a spreadsheet that tallies not only the hours spoken by each character (and their respective voice actor), but also the amount of files they speak in. For example, Amelia Tyler, who voices the game's silk-toned narrator, is understandable top billing at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds of chatting—over a brain-boggling 7,629 files. Hilariously, Astarion takes the prize for biggest yapper in all of Baldur's Gate, just one hour shy of beating out the main character's literal inner monologue: 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds.

The Zagreus Journey mod adds a third option to your choice of how to leave the Crossroads, a Chaos Gate labeled \"Descend into Nightmare\". Jump inside and you'll be back in Tartarus, with all the old shades and traps to contend with, before working your way up through Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx. Even the original game's soundtrack is carried over. What isn't carried over is Zagreus himself, and so you'll be playing as Melinoë (and whichever familiar you bring), with one of her keepsakes equipped, and encountering the pantheon and earning the boons of Hades 2.

There's an escort mode with a playable civilian class, four-team modes, jump pads, new weapons like the nail gun, dynamite pack, and tranquilizer gun, and more. But that's not the reason for its renaming. As the modders explained , \"Valve requested a few months ago that we rename our mod, because the name Team Fortress 2 Classic was too similar to their Team Fortress Classic.\" \"We've learned that various other mods have recently used the word 'classic' in ways that unintentionally made them look like official Valve products, and as a result, Valve had a new policy put in place back in September.\" Choosing a new name was \"surprisingly difficult\" both because they wanted a name that meant they could retain the TF2C abbreviation, and \"it quickly became apparent that few options actually embodied what we set out to do better than 'classic' had. …",

Skarven's first trailer is all mood and light on action. The player approaches a lonely country house with an industrial mill looming behind. In Danish, a TV anchor drops some crumbs of world building as the player creeps through the house: We're seeing a rising retirement age and increased labor automation thanks to a Children of Men-style bottoming out in fertility rates. We pick up a chunky, Fallout 10mm-looking pistol, the TV cuts out, and a freaky, Nihilanth -type dude pops out to attack.

So after months of living exclusively out of my Liked Songs folder and Spotify Radio, I finally went ahead and made a brand-new playlist a few weeks ago. One that could serve as the perfect ambience for my day-to-day life: working, cooking, cleaning, and unwinding with a glass of wine and my Steam Deck. And what better fodder for my super chill, super relaxing playlist than videogame music? After all, its entire purpose is to create ambience. It's vibes personified. Instead of telling you how it's feeling, it's trying to tell you how you should feel. Ooh, don't you feel so fuzzy and nostalgic as I play the flute in this quaint woodland village? Isn't the sul ponticello on this violin making you scared? You get my point. I have long championed soft piano pieces from JRPGs as the ultimate relaxation music, but I've found myself branching out to some less likely candidates as of late. The Minecraft soundtrack has been absolutely rinsed in my house…",

The result is one of the best strategy games of the last decade. \"While the inspiration is clear, it would be a disservice to imply that it's mainly trading in nostalgia,\" Fraser Brown wrote in his Northgard review , awarding it a score of 84%. \"This Viking saga builds on the history-themed RTS romps of the '90s, but it's not beholden to them.\" Northgard went on to sell over 5 million copies and receive a bunch of expansions and DLC. Now, developer Shiro Games has bundled several of these additional adventures with the base game to form Northgard: Definitive Edition , which throws in a few new features for good measure. Chiefly, the Definitive Edition combines the base game with the Cross of Vidar expansion, which introduces a new campaign where you must guide your Viking Clan through new lands in a post Ragnarök world.

We are also going to start publishing patches that modernize the game, make it compatible with Windows Vista or later, Linux x86-64 and aarch64 (Raspberry Pi and similar), and Mac OS 10.9 or later, fix bugs, and implement quality-of-life changes.

Every other week, I'll be sharing my thoughts on the genre, interviewing fellow MMO-heads like me, taking a deep-dive into mechanics we've all taken for granted, and, occasionally, bringing in guest writers to talk about their MMO of choice.
