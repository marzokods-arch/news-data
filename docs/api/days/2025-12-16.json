    "body": "Credit: Motorola TL;DR The Moto G Power 2026 looks familiar but tweaks the right areas to stay competitive under $300. Battery capacity is rising to 5,200mAh with 30W TurboPower charging, and Motorola claims up to 49 hours of usage per charge. The phone features a Dimensity 6300 chip, stereo speakers, and support for Dolby Atmos. Buying a budget phone often means making trade-offs. You might get a great screen but a weak battery, or a sturdy phone that takes poor photos. For the past few years, Motorola has tried to solve this problem with its G Power series, and now it looks like the company is making another strong attempt. Motorola has announced the Moto G Power 2026, and while it looks familiar, there are some key changes under the hood that might make it the sub-$300 phone to beat in 2026.",

Emulation on Android has had a huge year, but with just a few weeks left, yet another major milestone has been reached.

Most apps and services aim for feature parity between the two platforms, and when they don’t, it’s often iPhones that win, not Android phones — sadly. But that’s not the case with one particular Spotify feature that only exists on Android because it could technically only exist on Android: App shortcuts.

The Remix option has been relocated from image overlays to menus or UI edges in several views. There’s still no way to disable Remix, and it remains unclear when or if these changes will be rolled out. Google Messages’ new Remix feature hasn’t exactly had the warmest reception. We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

Gemini is also prepping a different look for its input box and some new haptics. What’s the best thing you ever made with Gemini? A Nano Banana image edit ? A nice big automated spreadsheet ? Maybe a full-blown research report ? Whenever we want to look back on all those creations, we don’t have to turn any further than the “My Stuff” section in our Gemini history. And while that’s already a convenient one-stop shop, it looks like it could be about to get even better, as Google works to organize its content.

Coach Niall Horan praised the performance in the moment, telling his finalist he was “so, so proud” and urging America to vote following what he called an “absolutely incredible” showing. Earlier in the night, Ross opened his finals run with JVKE’s “Golden Hour,” earning another enthusiastic response from Horan, who said the singer consistently finds “the heartbeat” of every song he performs.

The company has been quietly making “lapdocks” — laptop shells that turn your phone or handheld device into a full desktop — for nearly a decade. Now, NexDock is hoping to put itself back on the map with its 6th-generation NexDock, which is officially in stock and shipping worldwide.",

However, this occurrence of El Niño ’s cooler counterpart is relatively weak, and its influence on weather and climate over the next several months remains to be seen. Part of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, La Niña develops when strengthened easterly trade winds intensify the upwelling of cold, deep water in the eastern tropical Pacific. This process cools large swaths of the eastern and central equatorial Pacific while simultaneously pushing warm surface waters westward toward Asia and Australia.

Stranger still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in particular can be annoyingly inconsistent. Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

Now, an update to the Apple TV app for Android adds Google Cast support for casting to smart TVs and displays. The Apple TV app’s Google Cast implementation includes a miniplayer and full-screen UI while streaming. Apple TV is becoming a popular streaming service outside of the Apple ecosystem, with viral hits like Severance, Pluribus, and Ted Lasso. The streaming platform finally earned its own Android app in February, allowing Android users to subscribe to Apple TV or the MLS Season Pass on their smartphone via Google Play Billing. While the Android app supported many of the same features as its iOS counterpart, it was missing one thing: Google Cast support. Now, that’s changing, with version 2.2 of the Apple TV app for Android adding Google Cast support. It’s rolling out now on the Google Play Store , making it easy for users to cast Apple TV shows to their favorite smart TVs and displays.

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Google Maps has brought back ski trails, lodges, and lifts after previously removing them in 2024. The return of this feature includes updated data from new imagery and ski resort map information. The feature supports several resorts, but is also missing a few. In the past, skiers and snowboarders could turn to Google Maps to check on ski trails, lifts, and lodges. It was a handy tool that helped many plan their winter trips. However, this feature disappeared from the Maps app in 2024. Now Google has brought it back just in time for your next ski run. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Right now, the Google app hides your history behind the AI Mode button, but it could soon replace Labs in the upper-left. The Google app on iOS has already made this adjustment. Google never forgets. At least, not if you have history turned on in your My Google Activity settings. And for most of us, that’s a good thing, helping us pick up dropped trains of thought or just reminding us about content we enjoyed. How you access those records depends on what kind of history you’re looking for, and right now Google appears to be working on an easier new way to check out your AI Mode history in particular.

The experiment sees users make plain-language requests about the type of content they want to see. You can sign up for the latest experiment in Search Labs now. Google gives the option to try a bunch of developing search-related features early in Search Labs. This weekend, a Reddit user spotted a new Labs feature that purportedly lets you tweak the content on your Discover feed to your liking — using AI, of course. User Gaiden206 posted screenshots of the new experiment on the r/pixel_phones subreddit. Called “Tailor your feed,” the experiment lets you tell the Google app specifically the type of content you do or don’t want to see in Discover, with flexibility to add or remove topics, or narrow the focus of a type of content you’re already seeing. You can even use it to have Discover pick up or exclude content from specific sources.",

Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average. Wi-Fi still prevailed at a few locations, but most airports haven’t yet adopted the more recent Wi-Fi standards. As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

Some researchers estimate that there are as many as two trillion galaxies in the observable universe. At first glance, these galaxies might appear to be randomly scattered across space, but they’re not. Careful mapping has shown that they are distributed across the surfaces of giant cosmic “bubbles” up to several hundred million light-years across. Inside these bubbles, few galaxies are found, so those regions are called cosmic voids. NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will allow us to measure these voids with new precision, which can tell us about the history of the universe’s expansion.

Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

It features a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel, plus full-size sticks and front-facing speakers. Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

    "body": "One UI 8.5 (left) and iOS 26 Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority Samsung’s One UI has always proudly sported its own personality. It’s obviously Android, but it has also long looked and felt distinctly “Samsung,” even as other Android skins borrowed ideas from all over the place. With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

    "body": "Credit: Jonathan Feist / Android Authority TL;DR Popular robot vacuum Roomba’s maker, iRobot, has filed for bankruptcy. iRobot’s business will transition to a new owner, which is also its primary manufacturer. The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co. Ltd., who will hold the rights collectively under the name Picea.",

For a second there, Samsung had all of us fooled with dreams of a refreshed line-up consisting of a new Galaxy S26 Pro, an Edge, and an Ultra, which would’ve been a nice departure from its traditional S, S Plus, and S Ultra plans. Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

Now, though, things are different. Android tablets are better than ever, and they come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from just larger than a foldable phone to nearly rivaling full-sized laptops.

From setup to screen size, this $999 Google TV-powered projector delivers a brighter, bigger, and far more effortless viewing experience than a TV at the same price. Suddenly, a flat screen feels less like a staple and more like a convenience I’ve been overvaluing out of habit. If a projector can make me rethink furniture arrangements, budget priorities, and the long-term viability of my current HDMI cable drawer, it’s worth talking about.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android is getting a quality-of-life update that automatically turns on wireless debugging when connected to trusted Wi-Fi networks. Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies.
