A Daum report (via Automaton ) says the prize honors Kim's work on both Stellar Blade and the game that preceded it, the 2022 action RPG Goddess of Victory: Nikke. \"This Presidential Citation is thanks to the developers and fans who believed in and supported Shift Up, Kim said. \"We will continue to do our best to further promote the competitiveness of Korean games on the global stage.\" Goddess of Victory: Nikke was originally released as a mobile game—it made its way to PC in 2023 but remains available exclusively through a standalone launcher. Stellar Blade was Shift Up's debut release on Steam, which naturally exposed it to a much wider Western audience. Of course it was a different sort of exposure that put Stellar Blade over the top with a certain portion of gamers, but beneath all the silly T&A was a reasonably solid action game that put up more than three million copies sold across PC and PS5 as of July 2025.

This insight was shared by Sapphire's Edward Crisler, its North America PR rep and PC gaming evangelist, on the latest edition of the Hardware Unboxed Podcast . Over the hour-long discussion, Crisler and HUB host Tim Schiesser chatted about all things gaming GPU-wise, from the RDNA 4 launch to the current RAM crisis, and even Nvidia's 12VHPWR meltygate power socket. While discussing VRAM and who gets to decide how much a card can have, Crisler said with a smile: \"I got to be careful of what I'm about to say here. I'm going to get in trouble.\" And that's when he opened the secret book of graphics card making that many folks have never had the pleasure of reading. \"Sometimes I really wish the chip makers would get out of the way and let us partners just make ou…",

At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs. Samsung's SFP2 process is generally thought to be inferior to TSMC's various N2-generation silicon. However, AMD currently makes GPUs on …",

Our verdict is already in: Weekend/AU Editor Jody MacGregor was worried that Season 2 couldn't live up to the first season, but wasn't disappointed. \"Fallout hasn't simplified itself for second-screen viewers—it's still a show you need to pay attention to keep up with, and more importantly it's a show worth paying attention to,\" he says in his Fallout Season 2 review . \"The first season was full of great bits where the stars were absent, when it bounced back to Norm or over to Wilzig and Thaddeus and all the rest,\" Jody says. \"Season 2 carries on some of those stories—Norm continues to be a highlight—and introduces new ones, like what Hank's actually up to in Vegas, which are as interesting as the activities of the core trio.\" Even the fan service is handled well: \"I imagine someone has a list of 'things that happen in Fallout games' with 'be addicted to chems' written on it near 'get a rocket-assisted super sledge',\" J…",

Sure, it's expensive and difficult to get used to, but if you can afford one and commit to its steep learning curve, I reckon it's one of the very best ergonomic keyboards around. So when ZSA offered to send over its Voyager keyboard, along with its new Navigator trackball module, I had high expectations. Essentially, the Voyager is a pared-down Moonlander, with all excess fat trimmed away to leave as minimal a keyboard as possible. \"Laptop-friendly,\" says ZSA's marketing. \"Goes anywhere—on your desk or on the road.\" I certainly can't argue with that because with just 52 keys and a total thickness of just 16 mm (0.62 inches), the Voyager is as whisper-thin as you could want. However, both the thickness and key count result in some notable compromises. For example, there's no wireless connectivity option because batteries would add to the weight, cost, and size of the keyboard. With such few keys, you have to make full use of the Voyager's layer system to access standard options such as function keys. On the plus side, the ZSA Voyager comes with multiple USB cables of…",

In an interview with PC Gamer about the deeper consequences and \"much higher\" level of agency in upcoming RPG Divinity compared to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke didn't hesitate for a moment when asked if they were feeling more or less pressure now. \"It's more. It's more pressure,\" he said. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing,\" Vincke added. Vincke has previously admitted that Larian planned to work on another D&D game following Baldur's Gate 3 ; ultimately the team wasn't excited about spending years working on a sequel and pivoted to a new project, which we now know was Divinity. There will still be similarities between BG3 and Divinity—Larian confirmed it's sticking to turn-based combat—but if you think that means developing its next intricate RPG will be easier, you'd be wrong. Larian was wrong, too. \"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this.'

The game first made an appearance during our very own PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct , and last week's Day of the Devs gave us an extended look at one of the songs that'll be in the game, Under the Lights. It feels a little K-Pop Demon Hunters in tone, and I'm definitely interested to see what other tracks People of Note has tucked under its belt. That's partly because Jason Charles Miller—a name you'll most certainly recognise if you're as Final Fantasy 14-brained as I am, vocalist behind tracks like To The Edge and Close in the Distance—is the co-writer behind nine of the songs in People of Note.

We first reviewed the RTX 3060 way back in February 2021 . So, it's had an exceptionally long run of nearly five years. It's thought Nvidia stopped producing the GA106 GPU dies upon which the RTX 3060 is based some time in 2024.

Then we tally up the votes, hop into a big, global call, and argue over which games are worthy of an award—as well as picking our Game of the Year itself. Once the games are chosen, we assign award categories based on what quality we think that game specifically excels at. That's why there's a different selection of categories each year.

Amazon should know this well, having turned a bunch of The Rings of Power's second season into a weird rehash of Star Wars with Tom Bombadil as Yoda. And though I didn't hate the second season of The Witcher, it was a shame to lose the twisty structure of the first season's jumbled timeline, which relied on viewers spotting details to untangle which events took place when, and not gain anything nearly as thinky to replace it. So I went into Fallout Season 2 with concerns. For starters, I expected the pre-war flashbacks to become vestigial, hurried past to get on with the modern day story of Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Praise be to the Atom then, that the flashbacks remain central. Barb continues making moral compromises on behalf of her family and Coop keeps finding out about corporate shenanigans that force him to become involved. But usually the reason TV shows disappoint in their second season is, while the first season can focus on introducing the core cast, the second needs to broaden things to keep generating new story.

Wonder no more: in a post-TGA interview with PC Gamer, Larian boss Swen Vincke confirmed that Divinity will be a turn-based RPG, and elaborated a bit on what we can expect from its combat and systems. \"It's not a clone of D:OS 2 in that sense, it's a new ruleset, a ruleset built on everything that we learned from all the previous games that we've done,\" said Vincke. \"I think you're gonna enjoy it. It's very easy to learn, very hard to master, but it allows you to do fantastic things, which is the most important bit. \"It's going to give you a really good time figuring things out, and how you can chain things to one another and come up with all kinds of shenanigans.\" When asked whether Divinity would be turn-based and have a similar party size to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke responded in the affirmative. Baldur's Gate 3, as well as both Original Sin games, allow four characters in your active party at any time. So while Vincke didn't provide the exact number, four seems like a sure bet.

Now, Commercial Times reports that both Acer CEO Jason Chen and Asus co-CEO Samson Hu have expressed that there is an industry-wide consensus that pricing will reflect spiking memory costs (via TrendForce ). Jason Chen told Commercial Times that once upon a time, memory only accounted for between 8% and 10% of the cost of a PC's Bill of Materials (or BOM). Between Q3 and mid-Q4 of 2025, memory prices rose anywhere between 30% and 50%, in turn seeing the overall BOM jump by between 2% to 3%.

In a recent blog post , Anthropic explains that as few as \"250 malicious documents can produce a 'backdoor' vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume.\" These findings arose from a joint study between Anthropic, the Alan Turing Institute, and the UK AI Security Institute. It was previously thought that bad actors would need to control a much more significant percentage of any LLM's training data to influence its behaviour, but these recent findings suggest it's actually much easier than that. According to Anthropic, \"Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents.\" For those a little lost, 'poisoning' an AI can take a few different forms. For instance, earlier this year YouTube creator f4mi became so fed up with her work being fed into AI models via her video subtitles, she 'poisoned' this data by inserting gibberish text only the AI could see . The more gibberish in the training data, the more gibbe…",

Sammelin spoke to the huge response to Arc Raiders at launch, touching on the unexpected strategies players have adopted, designing each map to evoke a different playstyle, and how pleased he is to see some players adopting a \"talk first\" approach to PvP. We also asked Sammelin if there's any truth to the theories that Embark matches players partially based on their \"niceness.\" In the example our interviewer gave, it would make sense for Embark to match players who clearly preferred pacifist runs with like-minded raiders, especially in solo Q. Sammelin was cagey about the details, but did confirm that player behavior is a factor in matchmaking. Sammelin: \"Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We do analyze behavior and match accordingly.\" PCG: \"But you can't say anymore?\" …",

It's a short line from the end of the original campaign after defeating Lilith where she says, \"Without me, you would have no victory.\" Apparently, she meant that literally because Blizzard has confirmed that she's coming back for one final showdown. You won't be fighting each other though. She's going to help you kill her dad, the Lord of Hatred himself, Mephisto. This probably explains why everyone makes such a big deal about you having Lilith's blood. I've played every season since Diablo 4 was released and someone is always talking about how you have demon blood in you, and it's never made clear why that matters. Her return in Lord of Hatred will be big for all her fans out there, which includes me. A lot of people played through Diablo 4 and wondered what was really wrong with her plan to end the constant fighting between heaven and hell. Sure she's a little manipulative and very evil, but she kind of had a point. The writers who worked on Lord of Hatred are fully aware of the grey area she's in when it comes to her morality. …",

For context, at one point in time Smithy Sprint created a blast after sprinting for one second at the cost of 10 Magick. After the update, it got renamed to Smithy Rush, which instead causes a blast if you dash near a foe on a specific cooldown. Kasavin explains: \"In the particular case of Smithy Sprint, we wanted something simpler and easier to use for one of the main Boons from the god of the forge, though as part of that we moved the general concept of keep-sprinting-for-a-big-blast to be integral to the Black Coat weapon's Aspect of Nyx. So, ple…",

Arc Raiders has managed to find itself in a sweet spot for PvPvE where a shared hatred of arcs and greed for their loot binds strangers together, resulting in some truly brilliant cooperative plays. Something that the devs weren't 100% sure they'd see. (Image credit: Embark) \"Anytime you push a game out into the world and see the community play it, the way that they engage with it is often surprising,\" Robert Sammelin, art director at Embark, told PC Gamer in an interview this week. \"I think internally we were hoping that we would strike this balance of having people almost apprehensive on how they're going to interact with other people, that there is this tension, this underpinning of threat, but also the greater exterior threat with the arcs would perhaps invite these sorts of cooperative scenarios. \"But I think internally, play testing with devs, we're way worse people than the community when it comes to how we engage in combat.

That's not even the wildest part, with Framework going on to clarify that its new pricing \"remains below what is available in the open market \" (link original). Previously, Framework had called out Dell and Apple for 'gouging customers' over their memory price hikes, while remaining upfront that the company itself would have to raise its own prices in the near future. Framework also took the opportunity to assure that existing pre-orders will not be affected by this latest price increase. Furthermore, both the company's pre-built laptops and Framework Desktop that come with memory already installed won't see an uptick in price either—at least for the time being. The company calls the pricing situation \"extremely volatile,\" and states it will likely need to \"make further price updates on both DDR5 modules and on our systems that come with memory, whether DDR5, LPDDR5X, or GDDR.\" The company…",

Not because the product is incredibly complex or difficult to use; far from it, in fact. And not because it was a bug-ridden, early-release mess either. Indeed not, as the MSI MEG X870E Godlike X Edition is probably the most stable, easy-to-use, and feature-rich desktop PC motherboard I have ever tested. The problem is in its name: X Edition. This is a limited release model, created by MSI to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its Godlike series of motherboards. Only 1,000 units will be made available, and restricted to Micro Center and Newegg in the US, and Scan in the UK. So the chances of an average PC enthusiast being able to buy one are astonishingly remote, even if you have a wallet capacious enough to afford the Godlike X Edition. So how does one go about testing and ultimately reviewing a product that hardly anyone will be able to buy? In some ways, MSI has made the challenge simple by taking a standard MEG X870E Godlike (though they're hardly what you call standard ) and upgrading the package to produce the X Edition. I mi…",
