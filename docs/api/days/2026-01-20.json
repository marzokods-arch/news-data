You'll likely have a long trek ahead of you, but grabbing some kelp isn't all that tricky once you know where to look. How to get azure kelp in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) The best place to find azure kelp is in bodies of water like lakes and rivers in azure forest biomes found in Emerald Grove , the starting zone. These areas have distinctive blue trees, blueish grass (azure, you could say), and you'll often find lots of small ponds or rivers cutting through them. You can easily spot azure forests on your map, so zoom in to check if there's any water before trekking over. Search the bodies of water and you should find azure kelp, a bright blue plant that shimmers and often pokes out of the water. Since it's a plant, press F to harvest it. Breaking it with any tool or even your hands drops azure petals, which aren't what you want in this case. In …",

    "summary": "The best of both worlds?",
    "body": "Here's one that didn't show up on the CES 2026 show floor. Asus has some new dual-mode 4K monitors with uprated, higher-refresh 1080p modes . We've seen plenty of 4K dual-mode monitors before. But thus far, the 1080p alt mode has run at precisely twice the refresh rate of the panel's native 4K setting. But now Asus is launching two new monitors with 1080p modes that run at 3x and 4x the refresh of their respective 4K modes. By way of example, I reviewed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG last summer . That's a 27-inch 4K model that hits 160 Hz at 4K and therefore 320 Hz at 1080p. Now there's a new version of that display, dubbed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG Gen 2. As before, it'll do 160 Hz at 4K, but now hits 480 Hz at 1080p. That latter figure should be enough to satisfy pretty serious esports gamers and in turn allow the XG27UCG Gen 2 to offer the best of both worlds in terms of 4K image detail and 1080p speed. The other newcomer is the Asus TUF Gaming VG27UQEL5A. That's another 27-inch 4K model, but this time with a native 75 Hz 4K mode and a 4x 1080p 300 Hz mode. So, it's actually the 3x model that hits the higher refresh rate. It's just also starting at a much higher base 4K refresh. …",

It reportedly comes with deceptive names like \"Upcoming_Products.pdf\" and has an attached open-source PDF reader app. In many cases, this download would come with an uncompromised RAR file, which might make the parent folder seem real. When the reader boots it up, the file sideloads a malicious DLL file, which is placed in the same directory as legitimate ones. This not only evades detection but makes the downloaded file seem totally genuine as a result. That means one could go some time without realising their PC has been compromised. Once up and running, that malicious DLL file pops a Python interpreter onto the system, which runs a script to create a registry Run key. This ensures that the Python interpreter is active on login to the system, and can even give remote access to the user. From there, bad actors can take information from the machine.

Now, of course, it's very different: sometimes most people don't like the game . They're still complaining about Bethesda's Creation Engine though, which remains based on that rickety, hilarious Oblivion engine from 2006 (itself based on the engine of games before it). Someone else who's perhaps a tad fed up with the Creation Engine? Dean Carter, lead on Fallout: London, the sweeping Fallout 4 overhaul that transplants you from Boston to the Big Smoke. In a chat with Esports.net , Carter said that—while the Creation Engine actually has a lot of upsides—he's worried Bethesda is gonna stick with it for Fallout 5. \"I’m really worried that they’re gonna keep going with the Creation Engine,\" said Carter. \"I’m not just someone that’s going to sit there and lie and say it’s a terrible engine… but I do think it started to show its age.\" In particular, it…",

In an expanded class-action case against Nvidia, however, the accusation goes one step further, with claims that the GPU giant willingly used an illegal source of pirated books to train its models. As reported by TorrentFreak , an amended complaint (pdf warning) filed at the district court in Oakland, California last week, specifically claims that staff at Nvidia contacted a so-called 'shadow library' known as Anna's Archive, a repository of pirated books and other documents. The plaintiffs cite internal Nvidia communications as evidence, with the filed document purporting to show someone from the data strategy team at Nvidia writing, \"we are exploring including Anna's Archive in pre-training data for our LLMs.\" It continues with \"We are figuring out internally whether we are willing to accept the risk of using this data, but would like to speak with your team to get a better understanding of LLM-related work yo…",

The two duplication exploits relate to items and ammo, and basically were one of those where you dropped something and then picked it up in a particular manner to get dupes. Both of these have been fixed. Embark Studios has also \"fixed some cases where players were able to damage others from behind geometry\", which doesn't sound like it was too pleasant. Then there's the Stella Montis kinda-fix, which is an issue that's been hanging around in the game for a couple months: players anecdotally report that Embark has been replacing items for players particularly caught-out by this, though it's an open question whether certain spots persist for ne'er-do-wells to take advantage of.

With four Zen 5 cores and eight Zen 5c cores, and clocking in at a max boost clock of 5.2 GHz, it's a pretty powerful chip. Previously, Ayaneo's Konkr range has relied on Snapdragon chips, namely the G3 Gen 3 or 8 Elite. This is a step above the Android-based OS of the Snapdragon Pocket Fit . Built-in Windows support gives the handheld a boost in terms of compatibility with vast libraries of games on Steam and anti-cheat. If you're confused on the naming, the Konkr Fit is the one with an AMD chip, Windows operating system, and a larger frame. It comes with a seven-inch OLED screen. The Konkr Pocket Fit is Android-based, smaller, and presumably cheaper, with this model ranging from $299 to $329. The Pocket Fit comes with a six-inch LCD display.

Now the first of the trio has been dated—and we've had a glimpse at what it's set to include. The Regal Update is due January 26, so it's not long to wait at all. It's adding two new characters, eight new balls, \"several\" more passives, and a \"nice surprise we don't want to spoil just yet\"—which all in all seems like a very robust set of features. (Image credit: Kenny Sun) While they don't sound too revolutionary, the two characters seem like fun additions to the roster. The Carouser's power is that when his balls return to him, they spin in a circle around him, which should make him particularly powerful at close range. Meanwhile the Falconer fires her balls from two birds on either side of her, who seem to sit against the walls of the stage and shoot inwards—a bit like a remix of the Cohabitants. The true Ball X Pit fiends among you will already be thinking of possible combos with other character powers. I'm wondering about using the Carouser with the Repentant for quick-returning balls to keep the spinning wheel of death going as much as possible…",

The success of getting Hytale to run Windows 95 (yes, an operating system) within the game was reported by our chums over at Tom's Hardware , though it's really iamcxv7 on X that deserves all the attention, not least because they got Hytale to run Hytale , as well as the OS-in-a-game mod, and even a classic version of Minecraft (which is pretty ironic, when you think about it). COMMUNITY SHOWCASE: A community member ran Windows95 in Hytale! This was made by @iamcxv711 pic.twitter.com/mon88oDFns January 18, 2026 If you're wondering how any of this is possible, it's all because Hytale's developers, Hypixel Studios, have made the game's server code eminently moddable. The game client itself can't be modded (not yet, at least), but that doesn't matter, as Hytale Modding says that it's the servers that determine how the g…",

    "body": "Meta is allegedly \"turning a blind eye\" to illegal online casinos advertising on Facebook and Instagram. So says the Gambling Commission, a government body that regulates gambling services and activities in the UK. Very likely, few will be surprised by this conclusion. During a speech at the ICE Barcelona trade show (via Reuters ), the Gambling Commission's executive director Tim Miller said that anyone who has spent \"even a little time\" on Facebook or Instagram will have been served ads for illegal online casinos. Miller explained that Meta claims to remove any such ads when notified of their existence. But that implies Meta is unaware of these ads until being alerted to them by third parties. \"That is simply false,\" he said. According to Miller, Meta even tried to shift responsibility for sorting this all out onto the Gambling Commission. \"Their suggestion was that we should deploy AI tools ourselves to monitor and find these ads and then report them,\" he said. Miller also described Meta's searchable ad library as \"a window into criminality.\" All of this lead Miller to conclude, \"it could leave you with the impression they are quite happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking …",

When asked how Razer decides which projects actually become real projects, Tan says: \"We very rarely sit down with the finance people and say, 'Oh, do we do projections and things like that?' It’s really more of a 'by the seat of our pants' kind of thing. It's cool, we like it, it's gonna be fun, we want it for ourselves. I think the real kind of trigger there is, do we want it for ourselves? And if we really want it for ourselves, and we think it's cool, we'll bring it to market.\" Naturally, this leads Nilay Patel, the editor in chief of The Verge, to ask about what he calls the 'holographic anime waifu'.

Alas, it turns out that we were all just very naive, and Microsoft's software engineers had deliberately coded this functionality. Yes, I know that's blatantly obvious—it's not like Windows 95 was created out of mystic spells and ground up weevils—but back then, there was surprisingly little in the way of information about the inner workings of Windows, let alone any comprehensive guides to every function and feature. In his Old New Thing blog , Raymond Chen explains the 'secret sauce' behind what was going on with the whole shift+restart trick. Just as it does now in all versions of Windows, clicking on restart in Microsoft's then massively updated Windows 95 forced the PC to initiate a cold reboot, i.e. shutdown all processes, clear the memory, and cycle the hardware. However, holding down the shift key forced a different process: the PC wouldn't restart, just the operating system itself, displaying 'Windows is restarting' o…",

That's right, how long it'll take you to get the voidhearts you need is largely down to luck. To help you out, I'll go over the best methods of getting voidhearts below.

On Friday, the multi-billion dollar corporation asked the Court to delay some of its proposed antitrust remedies while Google appeals the ruling. To recap, back in 2024 U.S. district judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google had violated antitrust laws when it used exclusivity agreements to maintain its monopoly over online search. A number of remedies were proposed, including Google's divestment of the Chrome browser (which will ultimately not come to pass ), and most pertinently right now that the search giant shares its data with rival companies. The DOJ secured this latter remedy among others back in September , with the US District Court ordering \"Google to make certain search index and user-interaction data available to rivals and potential rivals.\" Google is now asking to postpone the sharing of this data while it appeals the DOJ's ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly. To date, many have criticised how the DOJ is handling its case against Google, saying that many of its remedies so far have amounted to little more than ' a slap on the wrist .' But Google insists data sharing would be a step too far at this junct…",

It is, as I said, a GPU support bracket with its own compact display. Zalman isn't quoting any specs for the display, other than revealing that it's an LCD, which is a pity. But I'm going to guesstimate it's about 2.5 inches across and three-quarters of an inch high. The listed specs do include 5V three-pin ARGB connectivity for controlling the ZM-VS3 DS's RGB lighting strip and USB 2.0 for hooking the display directly to a motherboard USB header, which is either kinda neat or suboptimal if you think absorbing an entire header for one tiny display limits your broader USB connectivity options. Whatever, Zalman ZM-VS3 DS comes with software to drive the display, but it seems like the output is basically fixed and restricted to just showing CPU and GPU temps, plus the time.

Director Ion Hazzikostas tells the publication that Silvermoon is \"going to inform our approach to Northrend or to other places we may revisit down the line.

Since then, it's been seeing 10-20k player peaks every month.

The fact that I am only writing about this now suggests that PC enthusiasts are perhaps not all that interested in these CPUs, but they should be and for good reasons. First of all, the Alder Lake architecture marked Intel's first attempt at implementing a hybrid core design in desktop processors (it had done so previously with mobile-only Lakefield in 2020). Sporting the monikers of Performance and Efficient core (aka P-core and E-core), with the former handling the donkey work in games and the latter used for background tasks or weighing in with thread-heavy workloads, the markedly different core designs have remained front and centre in Intel's approach to all its consumer CPUs.

Many of those involved in bringing the project to life have now given interviews for The Oral History of Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Music Game Boom , a newly released book by journalist Blake Hester, with an excerpt detailing some of those initial meetings published on Design Room . The chapter begins with some of the initial enquiries and how the project got started, largely thanks to George Harrison's son Dhani already being a fan of Guitar Hero. Dhani Harrison made the key introduction to Apple Corps, the Beatles' company, and key figures including the surviving Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, as well as John Lennon's wi…",

The Mortuary Assistant was something of a surprise hit in 2022: A game that puts players in the shoes of a fresh-out-of-college apprentice mortician who's called into work late one night to handle some unexpected embalmings. But this, it turns out, is not a normal day at the office. Your boss had the good sense to stay home, but you are not alone: Before long you're not only preparing the deceased for their funerals, you're also conducting occult rituals to ward off demonic forces. Talk about multi-tasking! I suppose it's inevitable at this point, three years after the release of the game, but the trailer for the film adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant doesn't land quite as well for me as the game did. The game, at least in the early going, is relatively subtle: Creepy as hell, yes, but things happen slowly at first, and the tension is elevated by the inherent unpleasantness (for me, anyway) of routine mortician work.

Arrowhead said on January 16, a few days after Redacted Regiment was revealed, that \"during final testing for the Warbond, we found a key issue that didn't meet our standards for a release .\" Some fans have speculated that effectively working stealth into Helldivers 2—which in my experience is very much a not -stealthy game—may have proven more complicated than expected.

The accompanying blog post states it \"represents more than a milestone; it’s a turning point—one that sets RuneScape firmly on course for the future it deserves.\" The plans detailed in the post are already in motion, as Treasure Hunter is already out of the game.

This versatile little tri-laser beamer seeks to follow your lead, and light up your life with a cornucopia of practical portability features. I wouldn't say you're looking at a projector as much as you're looking at a technological druid packing the Wild Shape spell. In all my years of reviewing tech it's become painfully clear that a plentiful feature set usually points to at least a couple of small caveats. No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer. Any piece of tech that can shift from projector, to soundbar, to fancy lightshow with the flick of some far-out mechanism gives me a palpable dopamine hit.

    "body": "Nexus Mods—the biggest mod site on the planet and almost certainly the first place you went the last time you installed New Vegas—has put the kibosh on its plans for a multiplatform manager: the Nexus Mods App . Instead, it's refocusing all its efforts on Vortex , its Windows-only mod manager that first hit alpha all the way back in 2018 (it's fully out now, mind you). Nexus announced the news on its site last week (via GamingOnLinux ), writing that it has stopped making sense—if indeed it ever did—to divide its development efforts between two separate mod managers that aimed to do the same thing (uh, manage mods). \"Instead of moving forward together, we were splitting our focus. Every feature built twice. Every bug fixed in two places. Every conversation about 'which one should I use' was a reminder that we were competing with ourselves instead of solving the actual problems in front of us.\" The short and the tall of it is that \"We're stopping development on the Nexus Mods App and focusing all our efforts on Vortex.\" Which, sure, makes sense. It is an odd move to develop two separate apps that try to do the exact same thing, but the death of the Nexus Mods App means the death of …",

    "body": "As you might have heard, Elder Scrolls Online is getting crossplay after 12 long years. The first murmurings about the feature came in Oct. 2025, when developer ZeniMax Online Studios confirmed to Forbes it was being worked on, and it came up again in a Reddit AMA last week when the studio said that while crossplay is still being developed, it \"won't be a 2026 item.\" In that same thread, though, executive producer Susan Kath confirmed that cross-progression is coming too: \"We will be doing crossplay and cross-prog at the same time,\" she wrote. It's hard to know when to expect the features, though 2027 is the earliest window players might see it. MMOs with both crossplay and cross-progression are exceedingly rare compared to their PC-exclusive or otherwise cordoned-off counterparts, and given what sort of trouble arises squeezing all those players together on a single platform, it's no surprise this sort of thing takes a lot of extra work. The note about cross-progression is great news, though, for anyone looking to explore Tamriel on multiple platforms.

I'll outline the two main options you have to find cobalt early in Hytale so you can craft cobalt gear and start working towards the even more valuable adamantite . Take note that you'll also need shadoweave scraps if you want to craft cobalt items.

That has now changed: Marathon is coming on March 5. The date was initially revealed by a premature preorder trailer on the Xbox store and while it was quickly pulled, an official announcement rolled out a few hours later. Here's the new trailer: The video is mostly cinematic, a stylish collection of environmental shots, fast cuts, and occasional bits of gunplay: Bungie is definitely going for a vibe here, and this trailer looks like it was built in a lab to drive hype and deliver the climax of a campaign to turn around what was looking like a full-on crisis for Bungie.
