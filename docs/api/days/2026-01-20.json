If the tool determines that you’re under the age of 18, extra protections will be placed on your account to reduce exposure to inappropriate content. Anyone who is incorrectly placed in the under-18 category will have to verify their age with a selfie. Since last year, YouTube has been cracking down on non-age-verified accounts. Although the goal is to protect the platform’s youngest viewers, the age-prediction system YouTube deployed has wrongly ensnared countless accounts owned by adults. If you’re tagged by the system, you can restore full access to your account, but only if you provide proof of your age first. Now OpenAI is following YouTube’s lead and rolling its own age-prediction system for ChatGPT accounts. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A wave of then-emerging artists, including J Balvin, Maluma and Karol G, were not only making significant strides in the local Colombian music scene, but also preparing for their international leap. Notably, Balvin became the It Guy, powering off the momentum he had in 2015, with two songs reaching No. 1 on the Hot Latin Songs chart: “Ay Vamos” and “Ginza.” The latter bumped Nicky Jam and Enrique Iglesias’ “El Perdon” from their No. 1 throne after a marathon 30-week rule. “I thought, why not go back to reggaetón? Because when all is said and done, it’s part of our culture as Latins,” the Colombian artist said in a 2016 interview with Billboard . “And finally, the song was so hooky, it worked. Let’s be honest, &#8216;Ginza&#8217; doesn’t really have lyrics to speak of. It’s a party track — a party for reggaetoneros to come out of the closet. We made reggaetón cool again.” Off of its 2015 success, the Japanese-inspired song kicked off 2016 at No. 1, where it spent 11 more weeks, until a new banger arrived: Nicky Jam’s “Hasta El Amanecer,” which topped Hot Latin Songs for 18 n…",

You’ve got shy but brainy new girl Gabriella (Hudgens) and golden boy jock Troy (Efron) who end up together despite their differences. Then there’s Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), the popular diva who tries to rip them apart; Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), Sharpay’s brother and partner-in-crime; and Chad (Corbin Bleu) and Taylor (Monique Coleman), the best friends of the two leads — who give pretty bad advice, but that’s what part of drives the plot forward. What made this film — and the two sequels that came after — unique wasn’t how the characters broke out of their archetypes by the end of the story (which they do), but rather the music that came with it. The first film’s soundtrack topped the Billboard 200, and a handful of its songs hit the top 40 of the Hot 100.

Yesterday, we saw a leak that said Apple’s next flagship phone, the iPhone 18 Pro, might tuck its Face ID sensor under the display, in the process shrinking the now-trademark Dynamic Island cluster and shifting it to the left. Today, another leak corroborates part of that story while contradicting another. Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels. Contrary to yesterday’s leak, though, this one claims that the visible Dynamic Island cutout will stay in the middle of the display.",

Bixby hasn’t seemed like much of a priority for Samsung lately, but it looks like that’s changing with the upcoming One UI 8.5 update. Earlier this morning, Samsung announced a beta for the latest version of its assistant, “upgraded to operate as a conversational device agent” that leverages Perplexity to answer complex questions. Samsung, oddly enough, has since removed its announcement, with its URL currently pointing to a Page not found error. According to the announcement’s text as preserved by Droid Life , the new Bixby will let you control your device’s settings and features by making requests in natural language.

However, this feature apparently keeps getting added and removed between stable updates. Google also added a portrait lock toggle in beta releases, but the setting hasn’t made its way to the stable release yet, causing further confusion. Until Google makes up its mind, users can stop the unintentional rotation by disabling system-wide auto-rotate. Back in September 2025, users began getting annoyed when their phone calls switched to landscape orientation while using the Google Phone app. As it turns out, the Google Phone app had just started supporting landscape UI for calls , and users with auto-rotate enabled on their phones were seeing the intended behavior but mistakenly thought it was a bug. Users are complaining once again that the Phone app is turning to landscape, and, as before, it might still be intended behavior. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "summary": "The store employee may have more incentives for you to sign up than you do.",
    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile store employees reportedly say credit card signups are now tracked as part of performance metrics. Customers may be flagged internally, prompting reps to offer the card proactively via SMS during a visit. You’re still under no obligation to apply, but don’t be surprised if the card comes up quickly and unprompted. If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

The issue particularly affects those running Android 16 QPR3 beta. While Google has acknowledged the issue and claimed to fix it with the latest beta last week, the issue still persists. When Google pushed out the Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update for Pixel 6 and newer devices last week, it shared a long list of fixes that the update brought. The changelog also mentioned that the issue of Microsoft apps randomly crashing on previous versions was also fixed. Despite this, however, several users have reported that the issues still persist. That could be frustrating, especially as Google endorses Android QPR beta updates — unlike the pre-release betas — fit for regular use. A large number of reports on the Android beta subreddit, as well as Google’s Issue Tracker, still echo that the bug hasn’t been fixed even after Google claims it has been. The degree to which it affects different people varies, though. For some, only certain Microsoft apps, such as Teams, crash abruptly, while for some others, it’s a larger mix of apps.

Late last year, we caught wind of another new tool Google appeared to be developing along these lines, identifying early work on a new system for figuring out when you’re riding public transit .

You can ask about existing events and create new ones on your secondary calendars. This is great for anyone with work, school, or family calendars. You can also change your default calendar to create events on, but the settings is hidden. It’s been nearly two years since Google released the Gemini app for Android and enabled users to switch from Assistant to Gemini despite a bunch of limitations and missing features. One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears. Now, two years later, Google has finally fixed this stupid oversight and added back support for multiple calendars to Gemini, so any employee, family member, or student can access their full schedule again — with a few caveats, though.",

Its full-color, 60Hz screen paired with Android 14 offer more flexibility than many e-readers. The tablet is available now in Europe for around €369, with no US release confirmed. Most Android tablets focus on brighter screens and higher specs. The HANNspree Lumo takes a different approach, using a reflective LCD display designed to mimic the look of paper while still running full Android. It lands somewhere between a tablet and an e-reader, offering users a more comfortable everyday tablet experience. Instead of a traditional LCD or OLED panel, the Lumo features a 7.8-inch reflective LCD display that relies primarily on ambient light. The result is a matte, low-glare screen that’s easier on the eyes, especially compared to the backlit panels most tablets feature. HANNspree describes the Lumo as a “Dynamic Paper Tablet,” positioning it as a middle ground between traditional tablets and dedicated e-readers. Physically, the tablet is slim and lightweight, measuring about 6.6mm thick and weighing roughly 250g.",

Realme says the battery uses advanced safety and longevity tech to slow wear and stay stable over time. For quite some time now, 5,000mAh has been the standard for smartphone batteries, often leaving users to carry battery banks or use a low-power mode. Now, realme is changing things by launching a smartphone with a huge 10,001 mAh battery, rather than just showing off a concept or a lab prototype. The main feature here is realme’s Titan battery, a 10,001mAh cell that the company says can last a week. The number stands out, but what’s more impressive is how fast realme turned the idea into a real product. After showing a 10,000mAh concept phone last year, the company has now started mass-producing the 10,001mAh battery.",

Only around 100 black units are expected to ship first, with wider shipments starting later in the week.

After relaunching the Pocket 6 with two different control layouts, early shipments of the Android handheld are now being staggered thanks to a production slowdown tied to its OLED screen. In a Discord update to customers, the company said it will only be able to ship around 100 black Pocket 6 units next Monday, starting with the stick-on-top version. Retroid says the holdup comes down to OLED screen calibration, which has limited how many units it can get out the door during early production.",

It’s pretty easy to create a secondary calendar in Google Calendar and then completely forget about it, but Google is stepping in to tidy things up. The company is rolling out a change that ensures any secondary calendars you own will always appear in your calendar list in Settings, making them easier to find and manage. Detailed in a Google Workspace Update , this move builds on a change Google introduced late last year, when it moved secondary calendars to a dedicated ownership model. Under that system, every secondary calendar has a single owner who’s responsible for its settings, permissions, and lifecycle. The new update closes a practical gap in that setup by ensuring ownership is visible.",

The Pocket S Mini has a retro-friendly 4:3 display, although the exact specifications and size have yet to be announced. On stream, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang held the device next to a standard smartphone, and it roughly matched in size. The screen itself is around the same size as the budget Pocket AIR Mini’s 4.2-inch LCD display, although this handheld is much, much more powerful.",

Meanwhile, Samsung appears to be releasing only minor upgrades for its upcoming Galaxy S26 series, as rivals significantly innovate — raising concerns about its competitiveness. Samsung is gearing up to launch a barely upgraded Galaxy S26 series in the coming weeks, hoping to take on the iPhone 17 series with renewed vigor. While Samsung mostly stagnates even on its Plus and Ultra flagships and might do so for yet another generation, Apple is preparing for another big change with the iPhone 18 Pro series and is finally entering the foldable market with the iPhone Fold , likely in September.

It could finally bring the camera on par with other flagships, especially by including a 200MP primary sensor. However, it’s unclear whether this is for the OnePlus 16 or any other phone. OnePlus’ parent company, OPPO, has recently made significant strides with its flagship Find X series cameras, from using a large 200MP telephoto sensor to supporting external zoom lenses on the phone . Unfortunately, OnePlus has been deprived of these features, with the camera especially sidelined to improve performance in the latest OnePlus 15 and 15R phones. This, naturally, has drawn much criticism, which OnePlus now appears to be preparing to tackle with the next flagship — most likely, the OnePlus 16. While the launch of that supposed phone is still several months away, we’re already seeing early leaks, starting with speculation about the camera. Last month, leaker Digital Chat Station predicted that OnePlus’ next flagship would feature an upgraded 200MP primary camera. Now, another leaker, Yogesh Brar , is highlighting details about the other sensors in the phone’s camera setup…",

Once you start enabling features that make a NAS useful, like remote streaming or file sharing, you are effectively opening it up to wide open internet and that means its time for you to start acting as your own IT department.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google could soon enhance the Pixel 10’s Magic Cue feature with integrations for Google Wallet and Google Tasks. Google Wallet integration could enable the AI to display live status updates for trains, flights, and events, making Magic Cue far more proactive. Google Tasks integration could make event reminders clearer by allowing direct access outside of Calendar. Magic Cue was one of Pixel 10’s highlight features, but it fell pretty flat at launch . Eventually, Google redeemed itself as Magic Cue improved , and while it may not be a groundbreaking new feature, it certainly has a place within the Pixel ecosystem. Google seems to have bigger plans for Magic Cue, as it could be looking to further upgrade it with Google Wallet and Google Tasks integration.

    "body": "TL;DR Last year, Google announced that developers would have to register even when users are only sideloading their apps. Eventually, Google backed down and offered to give advanced users an option for manual installs from unknown sources. Ahead of that rolling out, we’re seeing Google Play begin to prepare for this system’s arrival. Update: January 18, 2026 (11:18 PM ET): After publication, we heard from Marc Prud’hommeaux, the founder of the App Fair Project and an F-Droid board member, who pointed out that the warning strings we referenced are not entirely new to Android. Versions of this language have existed in Android’s system-level Package Installer since at least July 2025. This suggests that Google has been preparing the developer verification flow mentioned below for quite some time. That said, our reporting focused on the fact that this language has now appeared inside the Google Play app itself, which is a new development. The move from system-level code to Google Play could signal that the company is actively preparing to surface this flow to users. Still, Google has yet to clearly explain how its promised “advanced” sideloading path will work in practice. Until the c…",

I didn’t quite believe that the technology would be so pervasive years later, and such is the speed of technology, a screen that folds just once isn’t enough anymore. Before the end of the year, Samsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold . It’s the latest phone to compress a small tablet into a candy-bar form factor, but while this larger, multifolding device is impressive as a technological achievement, in practice, Samsung could’ve and perhaps should’ve offered consumers more.",

I’ve added a larger Nest Hub Max in my kitchen, and despite loving both displays, Google has given me little reason to upgrade. The standard Nest Hub hasn’t received an upgrade since 2021, and the Nest Hub Max hasn’t been refreshed since its original 2019 launch.

    "body": "One of my favorite web browser trends in recent years has been vertical tabs. Moving your tabs from the top of your browser to the side may not sound like a significant change on paper, but in practice, it makes your browser look so much cleaner and better organized. While many browsers — such as Edge, Firefox, Arc, and Vivaldi — support vertical tabs, Google Chrome has long been missing from the vertical tab bandwagon. But at long last, that’s finally changing; vertical tabs have arrived in Chrome !",

    "body": "The GT7 Pro was a rather confusing release for realme. The brand was clearly trying to walk a fine line between a premium and affordable flagship experience. Yes, there was the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a 3x 50MP camera, and a great screen. But the phone got extremely hot under heavy load, the 8MP ultrawide shooter was disappointing, and the lack of wireless charging was notable for the €1,000 recommended price. If anything, the OnePlus 13 shone a harsh light on the GT7 Pro. Between its versatile cameras, impressive performance, great screen, and premium extras, it was clear that OnePlus had the more well-rounded package. Now, realme is back with the realme GT8 Pro. And it turns out the new phone has a lot in common with the OnePlus 15 . In fact, this seems like the OnePlus 15 from a parallel universe.",
