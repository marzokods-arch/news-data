From the game's opening seconds it's obvious this was a massive labour of love for Harmonix, the studio that had kicked-off the whole genre with the original Guitar Hero. Many of those involved in bringing the project to life have now given interviews for The Oral History of Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Music Game Boom , a newly released book by journalist Blake Hester, with an excerpt detailing some of those initial meetings published on Design Room .

But this, it turns out, is not a normal day at the office. Your boss had the good sense to stay home, but you are not alone: Before long you're not only preparing the deceased for their funerals, you're also conducting occult rituals to ward off demonic forces. Talk about multi-tasking! I suppose it's inevitable at this point, three years after the release of the game, but the trailer for the film adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant doesn't land quite as well for me as the game did. The game, at least in the early going, is relatively subtle: Creepy as hell, yes, but things happen slowly at first, and the tension is elevated by the inherent unpleasantness (for me, anyway) of routine mortician work.

Arrowhead said on January 16, a few days after Redacted Regiment was revealed, that \"during final testing for the Warbond, we found a key issue that didn't meet our standards for a release .\" Some fans have speculated that effectively working stealth into Helldivers 2—which in my experience is very much a not -stealthy game—may have proven more complicated than expected.

I wouldn't say you're looking at a projector as much as you're looking at a technological druid packing the Wild Shape spell. In all my years of reviewing tech it's become painfully clear that a plentiful feature set usually points to at least a couple of small caveats. No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer. Any piece of tech that can shift from projector, to soundbar, to fancy lightshow with the flick of some far-out mechanism gives me a palpable dopamine hit. That's what Xgimi is pandering to with the MoGo 4 Laser: tech fiends with a penchant for adaptable equipment. At any moment, a swift attachment of one of the…",

VR headsets are becoming fairly popular, but the dream of putting on a headset and seamlessly teleporting to an immerse new world, while my lounge room fades away, is yet to be realised. While modern headsets have come a long way, they either lack the visual fidelity to fool the eyes, the comfort to convince the body, or more likely a bit of both. The Pimax Crystal Super is an example of a headset that does a lot to solve one of these problems, while kinda forgetting about the other. The Pimax Crystal Super boasts some pretty impressive specs, but as such needs a mighty PC to run. Pimax recommends you have at least an RTX 2070 to run the thing, but realistically, if you’re running anything less than a 4080 then you’re not going to scratch the surface of this impressive display. There’s simply no reason to drop the $2,000 on this headset without a high-end PC to power it. You’re far better off grabbing a lower specced VR set-up and upgrading later. You’re also beholden to Pimax’s software, which acts as a driver hub and is required to be configured to play some games li…",

Well, I've got good news on that front: Google will finally let you change your Gmail address . Whether your username is in a second language you don't speak, or simply wildly inappropriate to be sharing with potential employers, it's now possible to \"change your Google Account email that ends in gmail.com to a new address that ends in gmail.com.\" The feature has only just begun to roll out, so not all users will have access yet. For instance, I just took a look at My Account page and found that, as a UK-based Gmail user, I'm still locked into an email address that's now old enough to take on a heap of student debt but certainly doesn't communicate that level of maturity at a glance.

There are other memory makers, more so in the flash sector than pure DRAM, but even grouped together, they have nowhere near the same market share as any of the big three.

But the fact that I carry the same neat-freak nature over to my camp in Fallout 76 or my poor base in Cult of the Lamb cemented the fact that I should either talk to a professional or probably just play games where I can carry on the trend of ensuring everything is placed in an efficient manner and is aesthetically pleasing. So you'd best bet that when I heard of a game where I could clean a room up and then decorate it with all sorts of furnishings however I pleased, I had a neuron activation moment. Hozy is exactly what I want when it comes to a cleaning sandbox puzzle: it's satisfying, cute, and surprisingly detailed.

Below, I'll outline where you can find sturdy chitin in Hytale, so you're not wandering aimlessly through the zones.

How to get sturdy chitin in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) You can get sturdy chitin from killing the following mobs in the Howling Sands zone , which is the desert biome: Scarak Defender, Fighter, Louse, Seeker, and Broodmother Scorpions Armadillos Tortoises Given that the relatively harmless mobs on the surface, like tortoise, only give one or two sturdy chitin each, your best bet is hunting down Scarak mobs, especially inside their underground nests.

At one point, Bezos recalls a time when he was in Luxembourg, visiting a brewery. \"This trip was one of the little tiny catalysts for the founding of AWS (Amazon Web Services, founded 2002), and the brewery was 300 years old. This company [had been] making beer for 300 years … they had a museum, and in that museum was an electric power generator, 100 years old. \"When they wanted to improve the efficiency of their brewery with electricity, there was no power grid, so they had to build their own power station … they made their own electricity, and at that time, that's what everybody did if a hotel wanted electricity: they had their own electric generator.\" Why was he rambling on …",

Depending on when you're reading this, it might've done it already, given the patch launches on January 20. Alright, \"kneecap\" is harsh. Blizzard's made an effort through rounds of beta testing, and continual conversations with addon developers, to try and thread the needle between functionality and form. Basically, the developer doesn't want addons to be required—but anything that's cosmetic can stay . This means obvious things, like roleplay, map, and bag addons are all fine; It also means there's wiggle room in the combat addon sphere for presentation, which is nice for customisability, but it also means that certain accessibility features made by addon creators over the years can be maintained. Or so, Blizzard hopes. This also involves a lot of class redesign.

That's good news for people who love shiny new things, but it's bad news for those who love old things, because when Kiwami 3 releases the remastered version of Yakuza 3 will be harder to buy. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio confirmed as much on Saturday. \"Those who already own Yakuza 3 Remastered will still be able to continue playing it,\" the company posted on X , but \"for those new to the series who wish to experience the original version, it will be available with purchase of the Yakuza Complete Series bundle.\" The Yakuza Complete Series bundle is $130 on Steam when it's not on sale, and it's a pretty good deal if you want, oh, probably around 500 hours worth of Yakuza games. If you want to buy Yakuza 3 Remastered separately it'll set you back $20, though both the bundle and the standalone Yakuza 3 go on sale pretty damn regularly: the latter often goes for around $6.

We don't know if the strategy could have been replicated, but would it have been worse than the late Concord's legendary failure or the reaction to the recently announced Highguard, which was the final big reveal at last year's Game Awards ? Viewers expecting something like 2023's Monster Hunter Wilds reveal or the one-two Matrix Unreal Engine 5 tech demo and Matrix 4 trailer in 2021 have been taking out their frustrations on Highguard. The reveal was drowned out by hot takes calling out its \"Concord vibes\" and it received a ghastly 2,400 dislikes on YouTube compared to around 500 likes when it first dropped.

When he originally spoke on the issue last October, he said on LinkedIn he was offered a role at the nascent Vantage Studios, but that \"it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.\" It was evident back then he was not enthusiastic about leaving, as he said \"I came to see myself as the captain of the Assassin’s Creed ship, someone who leaves only once every soul on board is safe. And that is exactly what I have done for as long as I could.\" Friday, Radio-Canada reported that a lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Quebec claiming $1.3 million in damages (just under a million in US currency), including two years' salary and $75,000 in moral damages.

But just as all life ends in death, all digital gaming commerce ends in a cut for GabeN. Last Friday, New Blood CEO Dave Oshry said on X that Blood West's free giveaway on the Epic Games Store was a boon for the game… on Steam, where it sold \"like 200% more\" that day. He was quote-reposting a meme with over 40,000 likes expressing the sentiment that a cheap game on Steam is preferable to a free game on EGS. In the thread, he elaborated: \"I used to think EGS was a Marketing Black Hole but turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!\" He added that console sales spiked, as well.

If you're a PC gamer, your cup runneth over so much that you may still be catching up on the year's biggest hits even now, and you're not alone. In fact, one industry analysis group reckons Dec. 2025 was Steam's highest-grossing December ever. That estimation comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics , which reported that last month saw over 100 million Steam users generate $1.6 billion dollars in gross revenue. That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history. The report explains \"that’s up 22.7% over December 2024 and even more than December 2020’s pandemic-driven high of $1.4 billion.\" The report also notes that Arc Raiders is the second-biggest breadwinner of the season⁠—the first is eternally Counter-Strike 2, as dictated by the laws of physics—with a staggering 1.2 million copies sold just in the weeks between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4. As the article puts it, \"the brakes are broken on the ARC Raiders train,\" with the game selling 12 million copies overall. 250,000 copies were apparently sold on Boxing Day alone, with almost 3.2 million players checking in and half of them…",
