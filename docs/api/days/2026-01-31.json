    "body": "Credit: NASA NASA and Axiom Space have signed an order for the fifth private astronaut mission to the International Space Station, targeted to launch no earlier than January 2027 from the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. “The award of our fifth private astronaut mission shows that commercial space is not a distant promise, but a present reality,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “By expanding access and sharpening competition in low Earth orbit, these missions are building the capabilities NASA will rely on as we move outward to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. We look forward to building upon those capabilities with many private astronaut missions to come.” Axiom Mission 5 is expected to spend up to 14 days aboard the space station. A specific launch date will depend on overall spacecraft traffic at the orbital outpost and other planning considerations. “The International Space Station is a critical platform for enabling commercial industry in low Earth orbit,” said Dana Weigel, manager, International Space Station Program, NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “Private astronaut missions allow the station to be used as a proving ground for new markets and technologi…",

They could both win, since a new awards lineup means they’re not actually competing against each other. This year marks the first time that the country album category has been split into two separate styles. Thus, Price is in the running for best traditional country album for Hard Headed Woman , while Ballerini is among the final five with Patterns in the parallel best contemporary country album list. “Other genres have subgenres; I don’t know why we can’t,” says songwriter Trannie Anderson, up for best country song as one of four writers on Lainey Wilson ’s “Somewhere Over Laredo.” “I think it really just broadens the reach in celebration of our genre.

The B10 is designed to deliver the paper-like experience associated with E Ink while still behaving more like a tablet than a traditional e-reader. It features a 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display that tops out at 2480 x 1860 resolution in black and white, with 1240 x 930 specs for color. It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools.

Vans Warped Tour took a six year hiatus from 2019 to 2025 and returned last year to celebrate its 30th anniversary with three sold out stops across North America in partnership with EDM festival promoter Insomniac. This year, Warped is expanding to deliver five two-day U.S. festivals returning to Washington, D.C.; Long Beach, Calif.; and Orlando, Flor.; alongside the launch of two all-new international editions in Montreal, Canada and Mexico City, Mexico. In anticipation of this year’s dates, Vans Warped Tour launched the first look at the artists performing throughout 2026. Multiple artists will be announced daily over the next 30-ish days exclusively on Vans Warped Tour social platforms. Upon launching the 30-ish days of Warped in 2025, these reveals resulted in over 3.8 b…",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Log files from the Galaxy S26 Ultra suggest Samsung may finally support Android’s Linux Terminal feature after skipping it on the S25 Ultra. The logs show support for the Android Virtualization Framework, a key requirement that was missing on Samsung’s last flagship. With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android. The tool lets Android run a full Linux environment directly on the device, but Samsung’s own flagships were left out. Despite having the right hardware on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra didn’t support it. However, we’ve spotted signs that this may finally change with the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Verizon reversed a steep decline in Q4 2025, reporting 616,000 postpaid phone net additions after losing 347,000 lines from Q1–Q3 2025. Aggressive promotions drove the turnaround, including discounted multi-line plans and free BYOD lines. While this is a win for Verizon, it’s unclear if it can keep this momentum going. For years, Verizon was seen as the biggest, fastest, and most advanced mobile network in the US. It’s no secret that times have changed, and its reputation is at an all-time low . There are many reasons for Verizon’s reputational decline, but 2025 was particularly rough. Between Q1 and Q3 of 2025, the company reported a net loss of 347,000 total postpaid phone lines. The good news is that there are finally signs that it might be on the road to recovery. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Similar reports have been going around for years, but it seems that more users lost access to apps this week. We’re not sure what’s causing this. We’ve reached out to Google for comment. Apps are going missing from Google’s Nest Hub smart displays . A Reddit post showing a relatively empty app drawer on a Nest Hub led us to check our own devices — and sure enough, my Nest Hub Max is also missing shortcuts to apps it once had, though I’m not sure when they disappeared. User Head_Worldliness5101 posted on the Google Home subreddit yesterday, saying that the apps previously accessible from the app drawer on their second-generation Nest Hub smart display are now mostly gone, leaving only Sling, Stories, and YouTube TV. As they tell it, they’ve had their Nest Hub for about a week, and they had access to apps from the app drawer as recently as the day before their post.",

The last figures the company provided arrived in April of 2025. Android 16 already enjoys a 7.5% share, as of early December. With as much as we focus on Google’s latest Android fixes and improvements , looking at feature drops, Beta and Canary releases , and always obsessing about what’s happening next, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that much of the world is still operating on some pretty ancient Android releases. Every once in a while, though, we get a reminder of what this landscape really looks like as Google shares its updated platform distribution statics .

While NVIDIA still isn’t ready to publicly commit to a new Shield TV, the company has started sharing a little about what a hypothetical new box might change. One big focus could be better hardware support for modern codecs. There are maybe three kinds of Android TV users out there. We’ve got our Google fans, who will go with a device like the Google TV Streamer largely because — much like Pixel users with their phones — they want first look at all of Google’s latest features. Then we’ve got the budget crowd who just wants to find the most affordable streaming solution around. But then, there are the power users. They want hardware with versatile ports, the performance to game on their TVs , and they want to buy from a company that’s going to follow through with software support. And for a long, long time, that’s meant pretty much one option: NVIDIA Shield TV . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

But we have a concrete update on the Pocket PLAY that clears up one of the biggest open questions about performance. In a new post on X , AYANEO confirmed that the Pocket PLAY will be powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 9300 chipset. It’s a familiar flagship chip — albeit dating back to 2023 — and should be a solid pick, even if it’s not the latest silicon or the Snapdragon chip some fans may have been hoping for.",

Sure, it was probably a little too expensive, but the hardware felt brilliant, and I finally figured out how to use a device like this as a regular phone, which kind of justified the whole experience.

Or maybe you set up that doorbell cam to let you know when deliveries arrive. For my money, though, one of the most impactful, easiest, and affordable upgrades can be a smart lock — no more carrying around keys (and worrying about losing them), simple to grant access to guests, and a nice, logged record of your comings and goings. Nuki has already been a great option there for users in Europe with its Smart Lock Ultra , and now it’s bringing its Smart Lock to the US. I tested it out for a few months to see how it holds up.",

I own a few pieces of connected kit; my robot vacuum cleaner seems harmless enough, and I’ve even hesitantly installed a smart thermostat to cut my energy bill and keep my house warmer. But that’s it. One line I’ve certainly never dared to cross is installing a smart lock on my door. I can’t convince myself of the benefits over a good old-fashioned key, especially given some pretty reasonable concerns about service outages or somehow locking myself out of my home (though I have managed that with a regular key, to be fair).

More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

If you saw an SOS icon instead of your usual 5G bars last Wednesday, you probably felt cut off from the digital world. Verizon has since fixed the problem and restored service , but the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now starting its own probe. Regulators have officially launched an investigation into the 10-hour blackout that sidelined millions of customers and, more critically, potentially blocked access to 911. On the afternoon of January 14, Verizon’s wireless voice, text, and data services failed for users across the country. Outage reports quickly rose on trackers like Downdetector, reaching hundreds of thousands in just a few hours. Many customers saw only the SOS icon instead of signal bars, which meant they could still call emergency services, but regular calls and data did not work.",

The European Commission introduced a variety of regulations for electronics that went into effect last year. One of these rules forces manufacturers to up their game when it comes to software updates.

Rugged phones are rarely shy about excess, but 8849’s Tank X pushes the envelope. Alongside its oversized battery and reinforced frame, the phone adds an unusual headline feature: a built-in 1080p projector. The integrated DLP projector displays a 1920×1080 Full HD image at around 220 lumens, and supports keystone correction and laser auto-focus up to roughly 4 meters, helping keep projections sharp and properly aligned with minimal manual adjustment. While it’s certainly not going to replace your TV, it’s a notable step up from the dim, novelty projectors previously attached to smartphones, and one that could prove genuinely useful for camping trips or quick presentations in the field.",

The change introduces a new “geofenced variable power” category, allowing higher power and outdoor use under specific conditions. While little will change overnight, the decision could improve future Wi-Fi performance for your phone, smart home gear, and more. Wi-Fi doesn’t usually make headlines unless something breaks, but this week it got a boost that could shape the next wave of connected gadgets. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has voted to expand how unlicensed devices can use the 6 GHz band, a move that could make future Wi-Fi gear faster and more flexible than what we have today. As Fierce Network reports, the FCC’s decision creates a new category of unlicensed devices called geofenced variable power (GVP).

It allows you to log in to your Epic Games account to browse and download games on your Android device. Support is still experimental, and multiplayer games are not working. The age of PC emulation on Android is upon us, with new translation layers and software allowing you to play Steam games on your phone or Android gaming handheld without any fuss. Now, for the first time, you’ll also be able to play titles from the Epic Games Store library, thanks to a nightly update from GameNative. And if you’re like me, that amounts to literally hundreds of free games claimed over the years. While support is still experimental, the setup is fairly straightforward. After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration. From there, it will open a browser where you can log in to your Epic Games account. Then, you need to copy an authentication key, paste it into GameNative, and it should automatically populate your game list (give it a minute if you have 500+ games like me).",

Multiple users on Reddit have confirmed that issues with their Galaxy Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic have resolved. The update also brings the January 2026 security update. The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",

The Nothing Phone 3 can be classified as less than a success. While it excelled in terms of fun, quirky features , the Phone 3 did not thrive in terms of practicality or value. Despite its novelty, the non-flagship chipset and an $800 price tag easily made the phone feel impractical . And Nothing appears to have taken the verdict to the heart, to the effect that it is taking 2026 to mull over flagships instead of releasing one. In a recent video shared on the official Nothing YouTube channel, co-founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship phone in 2026.

Well, the results are in, and here’s how you answered the survey.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Global smartphone chipset shipments are expected to fall 7% in 2026, but industry revenue is still set to grow in double digits. AI-driven data center demand is pushing chipmakers toward high-margin HBM, driving up DRAM prices and squeezing phone makers. Budget phones under $150 are taking the biggest hit as rising costs make low-end devices harder to sustain. The smartphone industry is facing a paradox. Counterpoint Research reports that global smartphone chipset shipments will drop by 7% in 2026. Normally, fewer shipments would mean trouble for the industry , but this time, manufacturers are still expected to see double-digit revenue growth. So, why are shipments dropping? Part of the reason is the growing demand from data centers . As AI becomes more common, chipmakers are shifting their resources to produce high-margin HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for large server farms. This shift has caused DRAM prices to rise sharply, making it harder for manufacturers to create affordable phones without taking a loss.",

Many reports also suggest that the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi issues may have been patched. Google is terribly late at delivering the latest January update to supported Pixel devices. While the update was initially rolled out on January 12 , many users reported not receiving it until earlier this week. More than a thousand Android Authority readers also corroborated this in a recent survey. Thankfully, it appears Google may have finally ironed out what was causing the delay. We’re seeing new reports from multiple Pixel owners on Reddit confirming they finally received the January update. Reddit user Different_Dinner8195 recently posted in the Google Pixel subreddit, declaring they were finally able to download and install the update on their Pixel 10 Pro. As with many others who reported this earlier, the January update first appeared for the user but then disappeared mysteriously, leaving folks wondering whether Google pulled the update. It was only recently that the update resurfaced, allowing them to …",

This new toggle will improve discoverability compared to the current double-tap shortcut for switching between the two search experiences. If a classic search yields no results, Google Photos will automatically use “Ask Photos” to help find your media. Google Photos is great at what it does… for the most part . A lot of Google’s changes to the app are well-intentioned, but sometimes, users prefer the older way of doing things. One such change is Ask Photos, an AI-powered search feature intended to help people find content with natural language queries. Most users prefer the classic search experience in Google Photos, but many don’t realize they can double-tap the “Ask” button to switch to it . Google could soon improve the situation by giving users one more toggle to switch between the two search experiences.
