Aliens are attacking present-day Earth and it's up to you to figure out why they're here, what they're made of, and send them packing. Or maybe make friends. Or just profit from the chaos. We'll get to that in a minute. The difference is that this shadow war plays out across a detailed map of Earth and the entire solar system involving Lagrange points, interface orbits, and delta-v calculations for sending rockets to mine asteroids. The physics stuff isn't quite as granular as something like Kerbal Space Program, but it's close. And there are many dozens more celestial bodies when you include all the asteroids, moons, and Kuiper belt objects. It's legitimately jaw-dropping, and terrifying at first.

As Nesmith told Press Box PR in an interview , \"go back and play Morrowind and tell me that’s the game you want to play again. We all have these fond memories of things that were pivotal moments in our gaming fantasy histories that we absolutely move but you go back and play a 20 year old game and you will cringe.\" As gaming hot takes go, I'd put that somewhere between blazing inferno and white dwarf, but he didn't stop there. He noted that even Oblivion had \"cringe moments\" here and there—some of which he claims responsibility for, as he worked on Oblivion as a senior designer—adding that \"the further back you go, the more that's going to be an issue.

Named GTA5 V4EVER , Pluma's project strives to \"update the atmosphere of the entire map\" by stuffing Los Santos with more environmental detail than any game from 2013 probably deserves. Far from a simple reshade or texture swap, this pretty massive undertaking adds 20,000 new world objects—from trees to plants, shrubs, fences, poles, signs, street clutter, roadside scenery and more. Moreover, outdated props such as phone booths have been whipped out entirely; while neighbourhoods have been given a fresh lick of paint or a new coat of grime depending on their economic standing—with Pluma's end game being to craft a world that feels \"alive and renewed, without losing the original spirit.\" The outcome is indeed a re-densified Los Santos and Blaine County, whose main thoroughfares feel refreshed and its peripheries reinvigorated.

It seems like Highguard may already be moving in that direction itself, though, as it's now toying with a \"hectic\" alternate format. \"We heard the feedback,\" opens the first patch note from the latest post on Highguard's Steam community blog . The new 5v5 mode was implemented just four days after release on Jan. 30, which is a pretty impressive turnaround time for something added in response to community sentiment. You don't have to scroll very far down on the Steam reviews or on the game's subreddit to see people put off by the 3v3 format, as in this thread from user mexicantacothief. It's easy to see why. The game's raid mode is tense and tactical at the best of times, but it never really feels like a 'raid': giant battering ram aside, it's still just six people fighting over a sword and then a handful of buildings.

Bans make picking and counterpicking more interesting and keep imbalanced characters off the field while players wait for a balance patch—and to my delight, Deadlock has finally got them. Well, sort of. What it's actually added is a “prefer to avoid” toggle you can assign to one hero from the game's roster when queuing for both standard play (which is always ranked) and Street Brawl, the new casual mode analogous to League of Legends's ARAM or Valorant's Spike Rush. You also can't avoid new heroes, which currently just applies to the six characters from Old Gods, New Blood . The patch notes, which you can find on Deadlock’s feedback forum , call this a hero banning system, but there are a few reasons for both why this is different and why it might be necessary for a game in pre-alpha. Most ranked modes in MOBAs have a draft phase—a pre-game lobby where both teams take turns selecting heroes for their team and banning them so that no one can play them in that match.

But the \"pirate queen\" of Morocco is finally receiving her due, at least in videogame form, as one of the playable heroes in Civilization 7 's recent Tides of Power Collection DLC—thanks in part to the digging of one University of Kansas professor. \"[Al-Hurra] is fascinating,\" says Finn Taylor, senior narrative designer at Firaxis Games for the 4X strategy title. \"She was highly educated, greatly respected by both friends and foes, and accomplished remarkable feats during a challenging time in Moroccan history.\" Her last name is actually an honorific title, meaning \"free,\" and is given to those who lead—similar to a regional mayor. When Amal El Haimeur, an assistant professor at the University of Kansas, ran across her name as an aside in a book, she was immediately curious.

A 2013 email to Jeffrey Epstein's account notifying him that his Xbox Live account has been banned. (Image credit: DOJ files) In 2012, Xbox and other gaming companies began working with New York State to ban registered sex offenders from their platforms. Sony, EA, Warner Bros, Disney, Blizzard, and Apple were also part of the agreement, according to a 2012 New York Times article . After the ban notice, Epstein also received a notice explaining the cause. \"This message is to notify you that Xbox LIVE has permanently suspended the Xbox LIVE account associated with this email address,\" reads the second email. \"This action is based on the New York Attorney General's partnership with Microsoft and other online gaming companies to remove New York registered sex offenders from online gaming …",

Grand Theft Auto has always thrived on an outsider’s perspective. There’s something sardonically Scottish about its trademark tone—the relentless skewering of American excess and absurdity, paired with a loving recreation of the country’s most iconic cities. You can feel the awe of a tourist in the way your field-of-view shifts as you stare up at the skyscrapers of Liberty City—a technical trick that induces a kind of grounded vertigo. Yet Rockstar had never so explicitly embraced the outsider before GTA 4. Niko Bellic is quite literally fresh off the boat, propelled by his cousin’s fanciful promises of riches, as well as the horror of the Balkan wars behind him. \"I had been living in New York for a few years,\" Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser told the Lex Fridman podcast two months ago. \"I was single and miserable, and I…",

The Arthurian-flavoured open-world RPG recently surpassed one million copies sold, proving, if proof was ever needed, there's still a big hunger for Skyrim -style experiences. Tainted Grail kept players well fed over 2025 with a constant stream of patches, and Questline looks set to carry that momentum forward into 2026. With the release of Tainted Grail's latest patch , the developers revealed that a bigger update is coming in February, while a free DLC will be released to all players in March. Questline doesn't delve too deeply into the details for either set of plans, though it is slightly more forthcoming about the February update. This, apparently, will provide an \"extra pass mostly over act three, polishing many layers of the game\" including areas like level design and loot.

Now though, players can get their grubby mitts on it thanks to a glitch discovered by a YouTuber. Said YouTuber is JustGarrison, who, in a zingy twist of irony, stumbled upon the glitch during a pacifist run of Bully. JustGarrison's plan to complete the game without fighting anyone ran smoothly until he encountered Norton, a boss players must defeat during the mission 'The Tenements'. It's here where JustGarrison inadvertently unlocked the weapon—a sledgehammer that was previously only usable during the boss fight. During the boss fight, Norton tries to bash Jimmy's head in with the sledgehammer. But once Norton is defeated, Jimmy can equip the sledgehammer and use it to retrieve some key quest items through the medium of smashing. That's all he can do with it, however. He cannot take it outside. Like Greyfriars Bobby , the weapon is destined to remain by the side of its fallen owner foreve…",

Project: Gorgon is an MMO that harks back to the primordial days of the genre, with simple 3D visuals and a minimally-guided levelling experience that lets you figure out where to go and what to do all by yourself (or with a party of pals, this being an MMO). But Project: Gorgon doesn't solely riff on the rules of the past. It has ideas of its own, such as an NPC relationship system and dynamic environmental systems that let players solve problems like being set on fire by jumping into a lake. Its main attraction though, is a deep, open-ended skill system that enables players to tailor their approach to combat.

If you find one under different conditions that I can reproduce, I'll add it here! Since writing this just days after the update's launch, I've spent my nights testing theories and praying over Water Candle buffs. Cattiva is the \"easy\" part, while Foxparks had me rethinking why I signed up for this journey. The others were less hassle, but after browsing Reddit, Discord, and Terraria's forums for clues, it seems I'm not the only person feeling ill over pal spawn rates. I can tell you how to get the Terraria pals using the same setup that led me to success, but keep in mind the spawns aren't guaranteed immediately.

But which is better, watching Markiplier play the game for 45 minutes on YouTube or watching the 2+ hour adaptation he directs and stars in?

No, I'm not a hero, I'd just rather stare at a screen than do any real work. Iron Lung , if you haven't played it yourself, is a first-person horror sim where you're sealed inside a tiny submarine and submerged in an ocean of blood on an alien planet. Using minimalist controls, you steer your windowless sub around taking pictures of whatever is lurking in the bloody depths while getting progressively more scared and paranoid. It's a great game.

Here's the elevator pitch, as pulled from the TF2 Classified Steam page: Meet the Civilian, a brand-new special class based on the legacy Team Fortress character, and deliver him mostly-unharmed to the objective in VIP mode. Use TF2 pre-release inspired weapons like the Nail Gun, the Dynamite Pack, and the Tranquilizer Gun, all redesigned from the ground up to feel right at home with what's already there.

I had to stop playing 1v1 PvP in Armored Core 6 because it was a detriment to my health: The knife's edge, million miles an hour duels filled me with so much adrenaline I'd have trouble sleeping if I played too late in the evening. Other games⁠—and for a few minutes right after playing, real life⁠—would feel so slow I had trouble adjusting. The new demo for indie RPG Sword Hero made me feel the same exhilaration and \"nothing can compare\" spoiling, but in singleplayer. Videogame combat so good, it might be a problem. To my editor reading this: I promise I got work done yesterday, but when I sat down for Sword Hero's updated Tournament demo for \"just a few rounds to see what's new,\" it became the rest of my work day and much of my evening.

The moment arrived during a press conference featuring Tottenham Hotspur manager Thomas Frank, a Danish coach whose witty asides are not quite papering over the fact that the club is having a terrible season. Frank took over in June last year from Ange Postecoglou, a garrulously amusing Australian who committed the cardinal sin of winning something with Spurs and was promptly sacked. Nevertheless the North London club remain one of the biggest around, and one of the players it's been heavily linked to over this transfer window was Antoine Semenyo. Semenyo instead chose to join Manchester City for £62.5m and, while Tottenham have made other signings, Frank was asked to address losing out on one of the club's main targets. \"It was clear, there is no doubt, that the cl…",

Also unsurprisingly, given his competing store and past criticism of Steam, Sweeney approves of the action, and based on his related legal tussles with Apple and Google, thinks there's something to it. The lawsuit, filed in 2024, very broadly alleges that Valve unfairly prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms and requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices for UK consumers. Valve had argued that the suit should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—but a Competition Appeal Tribunal disagreed, ruling earlier this week that the suit can proceed. Sweeney has homed in on the DLC issue specifically. Although developers can sell DLC on other platforms and have it carry over to a user's Steam copy, Valve doesn't allow them to sell add-ons directly through in-game stores or to use th…",

    "body": "Arc Raiders ' Headwinds update brought with it the Bird City event, a new map modifier exclusive to the Buried City that's all about, you guessed it, avians. While the Bird City timings aren't very convenient for most folk, the rewards will make you rich, so it's worth swooping in when you can. I'll explain the Bird City map modifier below, including everything it adds and how it benefits you, as well as the schedule in your timezone. Take note that this is only a minor map modifier, similar to Lush Blooms, so it simply takes over the standard matchmaking for the Buried City map; it's not a separate node like Night Raid, for example. When is the next Bird City event in Arc Raiders? (Image credit: Embark) Like other map modifiers, Bird City is active multiple times per day at specific intervals (every eight hours) and lasts for just one hour. This gives you a very narrow window for when you can play it. Here's the Bird City schedule in your timezone: Pacific: 12-1 am, 8-9 am, and 4-5 pm PST Eastern: 3-4 am, 11-12 pm, and 7-8 pm EST UK: 8-9 am, 4-5 pm, and 12-1 am GMT Europe: 9-10 am, 5-6 pm, and 1-2 am CET Australia: 7-8 pm, 3-4 am, and 11-12 pm AEDT New Zealand: 9-10 pm, 5-7 am, 1…",

If you're struggling with the Dejected Assailant like I was, these tips will help you take Franz down so you can continue the main story. Franz the Dejected Assailant phase one I'm just going to level with you here. Parrying makes this boss so much easier. I know parrying sounds scary when the game showers you in shields and other defensive tools, but equipping a Forma that lets you parry attacks is basically a must against the Dejected Assailant. You can get one by talking to one of Jadwiga's Minions in MagMell next to the sparring arena. (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Other than that, make sure Noah is out on the field with you. If you try to duel the Dejected Assailant one-on-one, you'll have a hard time finding safe openings to deal damage, but Noah can help draw aggro away from you.

It's a big year for Phas as the horror rework and lore updates coupled with 1.0's debut are one of several major patches outlined. There's also a Unity 6 and network update on the roadmap that I hope will fix some of the frustrating connection issues I occasionally run into, and the long-awaited player character overhaul launches soon. I'm stoked to finally show up to the function (hopefully) not wearing the same thing as three of my friends. And by wearing the same thing, I mean all playing as the exact same guy with no way of knowing who's who. Anyway, as is Phasmophobia tradition, the Kinetic team is pretty hush-hush about the finer details around big patch plans, keeping things scarier for all of us come launch day.

The Fallout 76 Mojave Bundle , which includes that tasty NCR armor skin, a Legion Legate outfit, an NCR flag and neon New Vegas sign, a fancy lookin' new super sledge, and a few other odds and ends, will run you $30 USD.

This hasn't changed much since 2021 , when GDC reported that 31% of devs use generative AI, but how they feel about it has dramatically shifted. This year, 52% of the more than 2,300 respondents said that they \"think generative AI is having a negative impact on the game industry,\" according to the report's author, Beth Elderkin, who notes that just 18% said the same thing two years ago, and 30% last year. The opposite opinion, that generative AI is good for the industry, was only found in 7% of this year's respondents, a decline from 13% last year. The people least likely to approve of generative AI are who you'd expect: artists, designers, writers, and programmers. The people who use AI the most are also who you'd expect. Ever since CEOs started hyping the technology as a productivity elixir, skeptics have suspected that the executive class is more likely to personally rely on chatbots, and GDC's survey results are consistent with that hypothesis. \"Business professionals' usage (58%) far out…",

Some countries over the past year have issued travel advisories or cautions for people headed to the US: Canada, for instance, issued a warning in 2025 that anyone with a gender-neutral passport could face difficulty entering the country because of an executive order signed by Trump directing the government to recognize only two \"sexes,\" male and female. The US is also home to a large number of developer conferences and events, and that leaves developers with a tough choice: Put themselves at risk of detention or worse, or miss out on potentially vital opportunities for networking and promotion, which can be particularly important for smaller indie devs. Despite the high cost missing these events can incur, GDC's 2026 State of the Game Industry survey indicates that nearly one-third of industry employees who don't live in the US have cance…",

The survey results indicate that widespread layoffs remain a persistent issue in the games industry, having intensified during the transition into the post-pandemic era and the fallout of industry expansion and acquisition.

The man himself doesn't speak, but he appears to be wearing a sneaking suit similar to this MGS2 look. The teaser ends with the date and time of the full Year 11 roadmap reveal: February 15 at 8AM PT. Some obvious questions arise, such as: Huh? Collaborations are nothing new for Rainbow Six where cosmetics are concerned, but this is the first time a playable operator has come from outside the Tom Clancyverse.

VK Dual Blades (Image credit: Bandai Namco) You can buy the VK Dual Blades from Jadwiga's Minion merchant on the southwest coast of MagMell Island for 1,000 Haze The VK Dual Blades is the best weapon I've found at the start of the game, in part because it synergises perfectly with Noah's blood code, which boosts Dexterity and damage with successive hits. You can also grab a free Dexterity booster from one of Jadwiga's Minions in the gear upgrade room of MagMell, too. These daggers come with Shredding Spin to deal massive damage, though it eats through your ichor. It also has the Iron Will skill, which temporarily reduces all incoming damage. They're as safe as dual daggers can be without sacr…",

My favourite way to cut through the chaos of multiplayer shooters or terrifying horror games is to sprinkle in some light-hearted games, whether they be sims or puzzles, I don't care, as long as it resets my adrenaline. I stumbled across Little Woody after playing one too many Arc Raiders matches. With a free demo currently available, I thought there was no harm in checking out this 2D point-and-click puzzle game and having a change in pace. The only reason I was wrong in thinking this is actually because I enjoyed it too much, and suddenly reaching the end of the demo enraged me more than a backstab in Arc Raiders could—I was just starting to get into the puzzle-solving groove. (Image credit: Prism Realm Ltd.) But even if Little Woody's demo may be painfully short, what I played was enough to convince me to wishlist the game and start a countdown for its release. Waking up in an abandoned test facility, you climb out of a broken test tube and stand on your own two feet, as some strange, walking, thinking, sentient tree.

World of Warcraft: Midnight means to carry on this new philosophy, as stated in a roadmap included in a State of Azeroth video posted to Blizzard's official channels today. In it, a post-launch roadmap laid out a step-by-step plan for what players could expect to see after the expansion's launch. First up: Prop hunt. WoW's just getting a prop hunt. No I am not kidding, they are putting a prop hunt in World of Warcraft. I mean, it makes a certain kind of sense—Blizzard's player housing system has been in early access for a while now, meaning hundreds of different assets have been broken off into unique, collectible furniture models. The question you might ask yourself as a developer is, indeed, \"what do we do with all of these moveable assets?\" and the first answer that comes to mind is probably going to be \"prop hunt, I guess?\" (Image credit: Blizzard) While I'm sure it'll be a jolly old…",

On the first day of January, I was both cold and had a cold: a terrible start to my new year's resolution of, well, actually getting enough exercise. Luckily, the Meta Quest 3 I'd been neglecting for the last six months offered a welcoming solution to my problems. I could exercise in the warmth, without having to be sick and generally unpleasant around sweaty strangers. My rubric is simple. I didn't want to overcomplicate the act of just doing some exercise, so I set myself an exercise goal via my smart watch, without signalling to my watch when I was exercising. Instead, I would just let it tally up exercise based on physical exertion. So, if I slacked, I wouldn't finish. To establish some ground rules, I decided this would not be a replacement for traditional exercise, and traditional exercise would not be a replacement for it. I would try to do a minimum of 25 minutes of VR workouts every day, regardless of any other kind of movement I had achieved.

Despite hitting the ground running with the feature, though, Blizzard's keen to keep making improvements. That's per the dev's \"State of Azeroth\" video released today, which you can view below: In it, Blizzard revealed a few key improvements they're working on for player housing—for example, letting your pets run amok indoors, or hitching \"a couple of your favourite mounts up in your yard outdoors\". But the real juice is in expanding the current tools to be even more powerful than they currently are, as director Ion Hazzikostas explains: \"We've also seen and heard that as you're expressing that boundless creativity, and maybe making something like, say, a grand piano that you've cobbled together from a dozen different decor pieces, it can be frustrating when you realise that you have your grand creation, but it's not quite in the spot you want it to be in.\" In t…",

Essentially, the tech giant is touting it as an extension of its autofill feature, which fills in your address or credit card details into sites asking for the right information. Auto browse, however, can apparently go a lot further. \"Auto browse can help you optimize your vacation planning by doing some of the mundane work, like researching hotel and flight costs across multiple date options, so you can find a budget-friendly time to travel\", says Google. Even as an AI sceptic, I have to admit it's a strong start. As someone who books a lot of flights and hotels, I can confirm that comparing deals is an absolute pain in the... neck.
