This week saw Silent Hill f scoop a whopping 90 in the PCG review , and that follows hot on the heels of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a gorgeous and reverential remake of the most-beloved entry in the Metal Gear series. Right now the Konami stans are eating good, and the company seems determined to maintain its momentum. This week's Tokyo Game Show saw another \"Metal Gear—Production Hotline\" livestream, during which Metal Gear Solid: The Master Collection Vol. 2 was announced but not detailed (MGS4 or we riot), and we got a new look at Fox Hunt, a free multiplayer mode being added to Delta on October 30. Fox Hunt is about \"high-stakes, cat-and-mouse encounters\" built around Delta's combat and stealth mechanics. Neatly enough, the name is because you're cast as a candidate member for the legendary FOX unit.

Portal was the best feature in Battlefield 2042, allowing players to set up pseudo-dedicated servers with their own special rules and map rotations. It was almost like the old days—as close as you can get in a modern software-as-a-service ecosystem, at least—and my favorite thing about Battlefield 6 so far is that EA has doubled down on Portal. In Battlefield 6, your Portal 'server' will no longer disappear after everyone leaves , sticking around in the server browser as if it were a proper rental, and the developers have expanded the map and logic editing tools .

This all happens on an archipelago of asteroids suspended between small \"neuron stars\" above a planet decimated by an ancient calamity.

Well, the company's just announced another swish line of wired gaming keyboards featuring not only Hall effect switches, but also a tiny screen. Because why not, I guess? The Vanguard 96 range is giving me some serious deja vu, in part because the foundations of its design are very similar to the K70 series of keebs (and I reviewed the Corsair K70 Pro TKL last March). For instance, these keebs enjoy the same MGX Hyperdrive Hall effect switches that also featured in that earlier K70 range. That offers not just rapid trigger tech, but also adjustable and dual actuation (leaving my other half to wonder why the keyboard I've lent them keeps doubling up their key presses). The 96 in the name refers to the 96% layout, being a wee bit smaller than a full-size keyboard but still finding room somewhere for its rotary dial and 320 x 170 full-colour LCD screen. It is, in a word, 'compact,' though here's hoping that, once I get my mitts on these now available keyboards, I won't feel 'crowded' is more fitting. But hold up, this keeb is sequestering some…",

With the launch of the new 500+ , Raspberry is hoping to attract even more computing hobbyists to the fray, though what one modder has managed to achieve already suggests that its appeal could be even bigger than expected. The Raspberry Pi 500+ is a fairly decent update on the previous Pi 500 , changing the basic keyboard for an RGB-toting mechanical setup, doubling the system RAM from eight to 16 GB of LPDDR4x, and fitting an NVMe M.2 slot to the Pi 5's circuit board. This last aspect is the point of note here, because of what software engineer and modder Jeff Geerling chose to do with it. Rather than use it for the intended addition of a small SSD, Geerling took advantage of the fact that the M.2 slot is just a physical interface for a PCI Express connection. That means, with the help of an appropriate adapter, you can stuff pretty much any PCIe device into that slot, and the Pi 500+ should recognise it. In Geerling's case, the stuffing comprised an OCuLink cable, an external GPU dock, a Radeon RX 7900 XT , and a mere 15 lines of ad…",

It's a barrage of projectiles that twist and turn as it moves, giving it the potential to hit larger enemies multiple times with a single shot.

First announced back in 2016 , Ship of Heroes has spent the last nine years somewhat struggling. It was intended as a spiritual successor to City of Heroes, carrying on the torch of the shut-down MMORPG—this was before private servers burst out of the woodwork after years of hiding in 2019 . It's set on a giant, metropolis-sized spaceship, hence the name, and has a lot of the same hallmarks—archetypes with primary and secondary powersets, augments you can slot in 'em, and so on.

A few weeks before the launch of the subscription service, the Infamous Collection jumped from $118 to $170, a steep increase that many players assumed was meant to funnel them toward the subscription service. Gustav Nisser, Starbreeze's head of commercial, said there was no connection—that the timing was simply \"unfortunate,\" and the studio had \"dropped the ball\" on keeping fans in the loop. Payday fans, it's fair to say, weren't convinced, and now Starbreeze has decided to walk the whole thing back: The original bundle discount has been restored. \"The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch—and they're not wrong, it's terrible timing,\" Nisser told PC Gamer. \"We definitely didn't handle this righ…",

In less than 24 hours the project was fully funded and met its first two stretch goals: adding fishing, and a group of sentient fruits and vegetables. Not long after, Island Skies began to smash through its remaining stretch goals and exceed its $75,000 goal by $2,489,821, and pull in thousands upon thousands of backers. However, cut to three years later and the project hasn't come to fruition. In fact, the entire brand of Fluffnest is slowly disappearing from the internet. The store in which Fluffnest originally sold their plushies has been taken down, and attempting to access the game's official website takes you to a domain for sale. Basically, it's not looking good for PuffPals: Island Skies. As a result, thousands of backers have started taking to Kickstarter to request refunds for their pledges.

According to Digitimes (machine translated), Intel is reportedly raising the prices of its elderly Raptor Lake chips by over 10%, and \"industry analysts believe the price increase is likely related to TSMC and the lackluster performance of AI PCs.\" Raptor Lake CPUs, of course, do not have AI-accelerating NPUs. The latest Lunar Lake chips have low power consumption and high efficiency, which makes them strong productivity chips (and good for AI) but pretty weak when it comes to gaming. According to the Digitimes report, \"AI PC sales momentum is weaker than expected\", so those running local AIs are less prevalent than otherwise expected. The same is presumably true on the desktop side with the latest Core Ultra chips as with laptop Lunar Lake ones. Effectively, it appears to be seeing customers skip the latest chips in favour of the older ones. Digitimes doesn't note specific chips in its reports, but does clarify that chips selling…",

Enter some fresh gaming speakers.

With PlayStation bringing more of its platform-exclusive games to PC over time, it's maybe not actually that surprising. The Pulse Elevate wireless speakers are a swish bit of kit available in black or white colourways. These speakers also enjoy planar magnetic drivers, built-in woofers, and support for 3D audio. They've even got a neat-looking, adjustable lean-back orientation when placed in the included charging docks.

Uncovered by Tech4Gamers , the AMD patent application explains that modern computing platforms have ever greater memory bandwidth requirements. \"Because the memory bandwidth required for applications such as high-performance graphics processors and servers, which have multiple cores and a corresponding increase in bandwidth-per-core requirement, are outpacing the roadmap of bandwidth improvements for DDR DRAM chips, improved DIMM architectures are needed to meet such requirements with current DDR chip technologies such as DDR5,\" the filing says.

The game looks a lot like the studio's own (excellent) Friday the 13th adaptation and is set in the small town of Haddonfield, recreated with real period style. It's primarily an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, where the masked killer Michael Myers hunts down four residents, though this time around there will also be a singleplayer component recreating scenes from the film. This seems to be very much the OG Halloween, with no nods to the many sequels in the first trailer (though I could've well missed some), and is I believe the first game based on the film since a curious Atari version from 1983. There's stiff competition in the horror genre, most obviously from Dead By Daylight (which has Halloween DLC), but Halloween really is a hell of a license: it's the quintessential slasher film, and everything from the killer's look to the stabbing synths has become iconic. In multiplayer, this definitely seems to work in the same way as Friday the 13th. One player is cast as Myers, who has various special abilities, is unkillable, and can execute players in horrib…",

That's the initial impression I got from this mouse: it's trying to innovate in a way that could actually be useful. And now, after spending some more time with it and actually using it for gaming, I'm happy to say it's done so pretty successfully. The selling point here is its 'InfinitePlay' hot swappable battery system. Much like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset , the Glorious Model O3 Wireless gaming mouse can boast a kind of faux-infinite battery life, because you can swap out its 200 mAh battery with another that's kept fully charged, then rinse and repeat, swapping between the two whenever one gets low. You slot an external battery into the rear end of the mouse, then when you see the battery LED on the hub drop to red and the mouse's RGB flash red, signalling battery is less than 30%, you swap it out for the one that's been charging in the hub. …",

First, some more details as announced at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 . Qualcomm has shrunk Snapdragon X2 down to 3 nm thanks to a newer production process from TSMC. That's essentially the enabler for everything else that follows. The 18 cores are all a new third-gen Oryon design that Qualcomm claims was started from a \"blank slate.\" The result is 39% improved per-core performance and 50% faster peak multi-threaded CPU performance.

This year, at least, we're finally getting Bloodlines 2, but only a few months later we'll be switching sides and hunting vamps down in Code Vein 2. During Sony's latest State of Play, Bandai Namco gave us a new trailer and a release date for the vampire-slaying sequel. The trailer says January 30, though on Steam it's listed as January 29 , which may be down to timezone nonsense. Now, technically I should be calling Code Vein's monsters revenants, which is how they're referred to in the series, but basically it's the same thing. In most myths and across fiction, vampires are almost always revenants, but not all revenants are vampires. A revenant, specifically if we're talking about folklore, is a spirit or corpse revived from death. Am I trying to define revenant because I don't actually have a whole lot to say about the trailer? I would never. OK, I do actually have a few things to say. The abilities? They look awesome. Weird, techno-organic wolves sprouting from your shoulders. A sword made of disgusting sinew.

Firing a barrage of homing projectiles, Birt's Bees has quite the sting, but it's made even better with parts like Torgue sticky bombs and a taser underbarrel, which, when activated, breaks the damage multiplier of stickies. However, Birt's Bees is one of the few legendaries locked behind side content, so if you haven't been thoroughly exploring Kairos, then you've likely glossed over the boss you need to farm. Thankfully, you can work towards it very early on. Plus, it's also where you get the Kickballer , so you could end up with not one, but two incredible legendaries for your effort.

Forza Horizon 6's teaser didn't give much away, mostly just showing a bunch of licence plates from the countries the series has raced through, but how could I not get excited by the end, when we see Mount Fuji? Sure, Forza Horizon 4 will always have a special place in my heart, since it made Blighty the star, and even let me drive around my old university haunting grounds in Edinburgh. There's nothing quite like playing a game and being able to point out a specific set of steps you once puked up on because you were 19 and couldn't hold your whisky. But Japan is an equally tantalising prospect, with its extreme terrain, densely-packed cities and striking vistas. Forza Horizon is always a looker, and I can't wait to see what Playground Games does with the new setting. And, of course, Japan is a serious car country, boasting lots of manufacturers as well as a vibrant racing scene. There's a lot more to it than Tokyo Drift. \"For a long time, Japan has been top of Horizon fans' wish lists, so …",

That's per a news story by Famitsu (thanks, Automaton ) discussing its upcoming October issue. Relieving me of a bit of my embarrassment is the fact that the magazine itself also seems surprised, here's a quote (via machine translation): \"Surprisingly, this game does not have what is known as a 'character gacha,' and basically, you can get all of the playable characters just by playing the game. Seriously?! … So, what are the in-game elements that require payment? Mainly the parts that allow players to customize their clothes, vehicles, homes, and more to their liking.\" In other words, this isn't a Genshin Impact—it's just shaping up to be a solid open-world, free-to-play RPG with cute outfits and furniture you can buy with money.

Pressing pedals from hundreds of metres away, the remote drivers monitor car movement over a video feed captured by four cameras on each vehicle's roof. These remote drivers' setup is giving me serious rig envy. Many of the picks in our best PC racing wheels guide are swish, but the setup here is a cut above even that.

Picking the wrong one can be fatal, as these scarecrows will come to life and attack you, meaning you'll potentially waste your health and your weapon's integrity. The riddle and answer will differ depending on which of the three difficulty settings (Story, Hard, and Lost in the Fog) you are playing on, but it pays to get everything right, as not only will you make it out of the fields unscathed, but there's also an achievement for picking the correct sc…",

    "body": "After receiving a cash injection from SoftBank Group , Nvidia , and even the US government , Intel is now seeking investment from iPhone creator and longtime collaborator Apple. As reported by Bloomberg , and citing \"people familiar with the matter\", Apple and Intel are reportedly in the early stages of conversations about \"how to work more closely together\". No specifics are given on what investments are being asked for or what kinds of conversations are happening, but this is part of a broader comeback attempt from Intel. Intel has fallen behind in recent times, with the 13th and 14th Gen chip crashes only painting part of the picture. Its recent CPUs haven't been very good for gaming (while AMD has smashed it out of the park in that regard), and Intel admits it \" fumbled the football \" with Arrow Lake. As a result, a lot is riding on Nova Lake , and increased funding would certainly help it make an impact. More funding would help catch up to supply needs for any deals the company can make, too. Apple has a bit of a history with Intel. Prior to the swap to its own M-series chips in 2020, Intel was the central CPU supplier for all MacBooks and Macs. Apple also purchased Intel Mob…",

I've played Crimson Desert twice now— once at GamesCom , and another in April of last year —and both times I've come away unsatisfied. Not because I didn't like what I saw, but because I really wanted to properly cut my teeth on Kliff's moveset, which is about as expansive as any fighting game character's armory. Crimson Desert is the first singleplayer effort by Pearl Abyss, creators of Black Desert online, and while it has a Game-of-Thronesy aesthetic to it, that's just a thin veneer for the borderline Wuxia martial arts brawling going on under the surface. We see a little of that in the trailer. Somber, gruffly voiced monologuing barely holds together for a few minutes of sword-clanging before it throws a clockwork dragon getting chased by a real dragon and a goddamn mech-suit at you. From what I've played, that energy carries onto the boss fights—Kliff spends most of his time getting flung around, suplexed, swamped by hordes of undead enemies and r…",

I couldn't do it. My Yakuza journey ground to a halt. From the hands-on time I've had with Kiwami 3, it's a remake that doesn't reinvent the original, but—like the two Kiwamis before it—polishes it to a shine, bolts on some fantastic new nonsense in substories and activities, and acts as a glitzy refresh for a generation that, perhaps, didn't get to it back in 2009. Meanwhile, Dark Ties—a bonus Gaiden game releasing with Kiwami 3 that has you play Yakuza 3 villain Yoshitaka Mine—acts as the wholly new red meat to draw in those of you who already know Okinawa like the back of your hand. (Image credit: Sega) But don't let me undersell it: Kiwami 3 looks absolutely gorgeous and plays wonderfully. It just, you know, does those things much in the same way Kiwami 2 did.

The official remaster will feature \"new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,\" according to a post from Aspyr on the PlayStation Blog . They've also rebuilt the character models, added lip-syncing to the dialogue, and thrown ragdolls into the mix. (I'll basically never say no to ragdolls, so sure, why not?)

    "summary": "Well, a nice change from when Rockstar was threatening to sue them.",
    "body": "Back in August 2023, Rockstar Games acquired the team and tech behind FiveM , a Grand Theft Auto Online mod it had previously tried to shut down. FiveM enables the use of custom cars, maps, and weapons among other content, but crucially also allows for a much bigger player count in online games. Together, these capabilities made it a key piece of software for GTA Online's roleplay (RP) community. At the time, fans hoped this heralded a bright new era for GTA RP. Then it all went quiet. But finally we're starting to see the fruits of that acquisition, and Rockstar itself is helping to promote it. \"Nopixel V is the next evolution of the GTAV Roleplay experience, created in collaboration with Rockstar Games,\" said the X announcement . \"Coming soon to the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms—stay tuned for more information at nopixel.net .\" \"We’re excited to support the nopixel team as they create the future of GTA RP,\" said Rockstar , retweeting the above. What exactly Rockstar's support means is left ambiguous, but having nopixel V running through the Rockstar launcher feels huge. Nopixel is based on the FiveM mod, and is also the name of a custom GTA RP server on which so…",

    "body": "So, Google and Qualcomm are bigging up what's basically a desktop version of the former's Android OS for smartphones (via 9to5Google ). The idea, apparently, is to fuse \"mobile and PC\" into a single device. And given Qualcomm is part of this particular conversation, that device would presumably be running an Arm chip rather than a traditional x86 PC processor. The venue for all this is Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 , where Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon had an on-stage conversation with Google SVP of Platforms & Devices Rick Osterloh. Google said last year that it planned to base ChromeOS on Android in future, as opposed to being its own stand-alone OS. At the summit, the pair fleshed out some of the details. \"In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,\" Osterloh said. That has meant, for instance, that running Android apps on a ChromeOS device required a virtual machine. But ChromeOS will now be a part of the overall Android stack. \"We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems. \"This is …",

What might come as a surprise, though, is that it's only just started to be used in the machine learning sector, with t he very first implementation coming from AI firm Lambda , utilising the services of hydrogen power company ECL . Instead of hooking up its new order of Supermicro-built Nvidia GB300 NVL72 racks to the local electrical grid and water supply, Lambda had them installed at ECL's facility in Mountain View , California. This is powered by modular units, which contain electrochemical fuel cells, combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, along with water as the 'waste' material. Each NVL72 rack requires 172 kW of power, so the fuel cells obviously need to be seriously beefy. It also means that they'll generate quite a lot of water, but that's fine, becau…",

Simply named No Fog , this mod, created by Fellow_Demo, strips all the fog from Ebisugaoka, but players can also use it to just \"tone down\" the fog as well. Seeing the before and after pictures next to one another, it's clear how much was lost to the fog, aesthetically speaking. (Image credit: Konami / Fellow_Demo) The images with no fog look brilliant. The town looks much more vibrant, which really helps you appreciate the quality of the graphics. It also strips away any eeriness and actually makes it look like a lovely, normal town that I'd love to visit, as long as none of the monsters are still lurking around. It's a fun mod to see out so soon, but in all honesty, I don't think there's much need to tone down the fog for those who aren't just interested in sightseeing—you can see everything you need to with it there just fine. Plus, removing fog from Silent Hill is like getting rid of matches from The Evil Within or telling Leon Kennedy he can't backflip anymore—i…",
