But not our number one most-read story of the year, which is a very human, and very funny, tale: A reminder that our essential humanity is far greater and more powerful than anything a slop machine can produce, no matter how many \"ideas\" it steals from the internet.

What a time to be alive!\" Suffice to say, the wildcards are full of surprises, shining a spotlight on the hardware hits that otherwise don't neatly fit into another award category. Your best graphics cards and your best handheld gaming PC are all well and good, but the best gaming router is a decidedly more niche category that doesn't always enjoy quite the same amount of fanfare. But don't worry, this year's category isn't two kind of good gaming routers and a gaggle of Mesh Wi-Fi devices—though, spoiler alert, the TP-Link Deco BE68 BE14000 does actually feature below. If you're wondering \"But why?\" or even \"Wait, what exactly is a mesh Wi-Fi device anyway?\" then read on—there's plenty more insightful surprises among this year's wildcard nominees.

Before we slam the door shut on 2025, lets take a moment to see how well we remember it. A ton of games came out this year, and while there's no way to keep track of all of them, you've probably got a decent idea of what part of the year games like Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 came out. Or do you? Let's find out in the quiz below. For each of the 10 questions, I'll give you three games that released in 2025, and all you have to do is drag and drop them into the order they came out. Put the earliest game on the left and the most recent on the right. Should be a cakewalk! Although... our memories can get foggy pretty quickly. Did Arc Raiders come out before Dispatch, or after it?

    "body": "Gear of the Year (Image credit: Future) Check out more of the year's best tech in our PC Gamer Hardware Awards 2025 coverage. I always love a new GPU year. When a whole new generation of graphics cards is going to drop, it energises the entire PC gaming hardware industry; people are going to upgrade, new laptops will arrive, and companies will refresh their entire PC lineups. It's big. Which is why it was a real shame that the launches of both AMD and Nvidia GPUs this year were such a nightmare. Issues with drivers, hardware, and above all, pricing and availability made it hard to enjoy the thrill of new gaming tech. So, in a mess of a launch, who gets the nominations for the best graphics card of 2025? Well, thankfully the rest of the year took care of the failures of launch time, with all the new GPUs becoming far more affordable and far closer to MSRP (in some cases even below!), and now widely available, too. Just in time for the RAMpocalypse to strike and push prices up on anything that has any little bit of memory inside it. Hint: that means everything. Whatever, the graphics cards of 2025 still represent the best of AMD and Nvidia's respective architectures, and if you want…",

Nightreign uses the Dark Souls formula for its combat, but might I call the jury to examine the thing: It's a multiplayer co-op action game based on short, semi-permadeath runs with limited outside progression. That's a roguelike, baby, no matter how many old habits FromSoftware plugged into it . To me, a soulslike isn't about how chunky the dodge roll is or whether you have a stamina bar—it's about the slow, tense exploration of a dangerous world. It's about deliberate and hard-won mastery over mechanics and, more to the point: It's about the boss fights, baby. Big, satisfying walls to slam your head against, where the only thing between victory is you and your own personal skill, not whether you got Let Me Solo Her in your fireteam or lucked into a busted build. But hey, you know what is a soulslike? Lies of P . You know what DID have a DLC come out this year? Lies of P.

Thanks to YouTube user isfooPoE , we now know its possible to kill some of the toughest bosses in the game without wearing a single piece of gear. Loot is king in PoE 2, as it is in any other action RPG, but it's also apparently optional if you're playing a monk with the power to shock bosses in one swift strike. IsfooPoE's build requires nothing but a set of unarmed skills that do a surprising amount of damage without any items to supplement them. Their fight against Arbiter of Ash is mighty impressive to watch, mostly because it's the clearest example of the soulslike bones in PoE 2. IsfooPoE dodge-rolls out of the bosses swings like they're in a FromSoftware game. The boss has the power to set the entire room on fire and it still can't land many hits on a dude wearing nothing but a t-shirt and pants. The high damage largely comes from a skill that triggers lightning strikes when you dash. Those lightning strikes then explode the ice walls isfooPoE puts around the boss.

And that's just the first episode, which launched into early access last year . Fans have been eagerly awaiting the second episode since then, but a development update on Steam confirmed yesterday that it won't hit its old release window of \"before the end of 2025.\" That said, it did share some exciting details, as well as a brief teaser. The teaser shows off a thing of beauty as hilarious as it is genuinely cool: a first-person car chase where the player smokes a cigar, blasts foes with a tommy gun through each window, and maneuvers with one foot on the steering wheel and another on the gas. If nothing else, it seems like the second episode will lean in even harder to the over-the-top comic book action. The rest of the update shows off some new areas, story comics, and teases Delia, a \"fully controllable NPC companion\" that responds to commands like \"move there,\" \"stay here,\" and \"shoot that fuckin' guy!\" It looks…",

A follow-up shared that while no players would be punished for spending the random credits, all transactions from the time the incident started would be rolled back. It also clarified that the sudden influx of bans was part of the breach and that \"any messages seen\" via the ban ticker were not Ubisoft's doing, which I think was never in question given that one of them read \"Yves Guillemot was in the epstein files.\" The extent to which the game and any users were compromised is unclear, but the game is back up as of last night , December 28, but the in-game marketplace is still down.

And according to its new owner, it has some big goals for next year and beyond when it comes to expanding its library of classic games. Announced today , GOG will now be in the hands of Michal Kicinski. Kicinski isn't some random suit, however, he was a co-founder of GOG when it started in 2008 under CD Projekt Red—which he also co-founded. Everything about GOG will stay the same, including the games available on the platform and everyone's library of games. Kicinski preached GOG's goal of being a place for \"freedom, independence, and genuine control,\" over the games you own in the announcement post. \"This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision,\" the post reads. \"We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.\" It's also pointed out in the post that GOG has plans to \"undertake even more …",

I came away from the presentation with a big ole' meh. That changed the first time I reared up as a bear and slapped a zombie with my big, meaty paw. Say what you want about the pacing change between PoE2 and its predecessor, I really do find the combat to be more fun. Early bosses especially have that tough soulslike feel, and having to do more than just activate Righteous Fire and meander through loot explosions actually makes me enjoy the game more. That's in part down to how the skills are designed to make you use them in concert and the monsters themselves, but perhaps the biggest factor is the new character rigs that have let GGG make some really satisfying skills.

Looking back, 2025 was a year where cozy games really broke the mold and appealed to a wider audience. Notably though, I found that I didn't just spend hundreds of hours in a dozen farming simulators. This might be a conscious effort on my part, because other than becoming infatuated with Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, I actually didn't sink much time at all into finding my next farming obsession. So if you want to do the same, here are my favorite cozy games from 2025.

I've always liked the idea of a charging dock conceptually, but I've never quite committed to getting a bit of gaming gear with one for a specific reason: I'm a bit lazy. I was worried I'd pay a premium for a bit of hardware, and then forget to charge it, so end up leaving it plugged in anyway, thus removing the whole point of getting it in the first place. Well, I and all my hubris didn't account for two ways that 8BitDo's Retro R8 would counter those points. First is that its retail price is $50 (with it going as low as $35 already). The second is that it looks so good, I can't help but put it on its well-earned throne. See, the Retro R8 I reviewed earlier this year comes in an NES-style theming, with a smattering of whites, greys, reds, and blacks. It looks incredible next to my 8BitDo Retro keyboard . The stand itself plugs into the PC via a USB Type-C cable, and you can pop a dongle from the bottom of the mouse into the stand.

(Image credit: Richard Garriott) Akalabeth's world was a meager, primitive trick of the light. But in the days of text-based multi-user dungeons and Zork it was a crumb of revelatory proof that the emergent worlds players imagined in freeform sessions of Dungeons & Dragons—which was only five years old at this point—could be cast in a virtual mould, simulated with math, and explored through the phosphor glow of a CRT monitor.

In many ways, it's a great game—a throwback to the arcade beat-'em-up era that proves how fun and satisfying that classic formula can still be. But at the same time, it feels like that devotion to nostalgia holds it back, with a short campaign and few incentives to replay. I thought it was going to be the defining beat-'em-up of the year, but the more I played it, the more I found my mind drifting back to a different game I'd played only a month before: Absolum .

They're both side-scrolling beat-'em-ups with an emphasis on honing your skills, they're both brought to life with gorgeous 2D animation, and they even both have the same publisher: Dotemu.

However, 2025 has seen the rise of several reasonably-priced contenders that can swim remarkably close to the pricier players for minimal expense, and that's the sort of development I can really get behind. Each of the three microphones below is very well-priced for what it delivers, and also happens to be one of the best mics we've tested all year. All that's left now is to give one of our contenders the best microphone of 2025 award, so we'd better round up our nominations into one big capsule-shaped basket, hadn't we? If you're looking for the cheapest of the cheap, look no further than the Amazon Basics USB Condenser Microphone .

There have been no reference cards for AMD's new RDNA 4 architecture, and so I've got a selection of different options—all with different price tags—in front of me to base my effectively definitive review of what is actually the best AMD GPU in many a long year. And potentially none of them are at the ultra-aggressive $599 price point that should make this impressive card an outright winner.

In more recent years I've gone spelunking in places like iTunes, but inconsistent regional availability, seemingly random tags that omit or misspell an artist's name or list soundtracks under a generic publisher label can make game music frustratingly hard to find. Thankfully, things are getting better—and especially on Steam. I can buy and listen to standalone soundtracks in a click or two.

I thought I couldn't really be surprised by a new model, but the Fractal Design Scape changed all that for me in 2025. It's got the same recipe, sure. But in terms of the experience it delivers, it feels like Fractal Design has taken all the things I love about a really good set of gaming cans and elevated them to new heights. I'm convinced it's the way all wireless gaming headsets should be from this point onwards, and that makes it the best thing I've personally tested all year. The Scape is a lesson in refinement. For a start, it's got a grown-up chassis design. No garish colour schemes here, just a flat black, matte finish with some subtle, recessed RGB lighting.

The now-ubiquitous portmanteau we use to describe the genre is, in itself, a reference to it being fertile ground for cross-pollinating ideas. Metroid's exploration dovetailed nicely with Castlevania's gothic stylings and Symphony Of The Night's surprisingly in-depth RPG elements, which Hollow Knight dials down the in favour of death mechanics and boss runbacks from Dark Souls.

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . I like shooting dudes—or stabbing them, setting them on fire, blowing them up, running them over with tracked vehicles, clubbing them to death with a hammer, whatever the latest game in my library calls for—as much as the next guy. It's fun! It also sometimes feels very limiting: I wonder, as I put three in the back of some digital rando's head for the thousandth time, is this all there is? Herdling was my antidote to all the digital bloodletting of 2025. It's a light puzzle adventure game about life and hope, dreams and magic, where violence exists solely as something to be avoided. Any fool can kill, and as Herdling begins, those fools have done a great job of it: The world lies dying, a victim of neglectful indifference and selfishiness, and no one seems to care, or even notice. But there is still magic to be found, if you know where to look amidst dirty underpasses and greasy parking lots—or if you'r…",

We've not only seen some fantastic iterations on already-great designs—hello Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro —but also some genuinely new and interesting leaps forward. The other two nominees for the best gaming mouse of 2025 epitomise this, with one being a big leap forward in light mouse weight, and the other being a big leap in customisability. In addition to these, though, 2025 has given us a bunch of great new mice in pretty much every niche. Want an MMO mouse? Great, you have the Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE . Want an ergonomic mouse? You have the Keychron M5 . Want something very cheap but high quality? No problem, you have the Glorious Model O Eternal . There's even been something for those of you looking for a nostalgia hit in the form of the 8BitDo Retro R8 . All those are genuinely fantastic mice, too.

Remarkably, it's not even close. Its previous peak is from when it released into early access in 2018, at just over 33,000 players, and this holiday season has brought it screaming past 57,000 a few hours before I wrote this article (it's settled down to about 35,000 now—still a notch above the old record). The game has been good the whole time, but there are a few probable causes for this sudden surge in spire slaying. As SteamDB notes , the 2025 winter sale brought Slay the Spire to a historic low of $2.49; while the site only records sale history two years back, I don't recall it ever being quite this cheap. As everyone rushes to burn their Steam wallets on the best deals, such an acclaimed game for the price of a pack of gum is a no-brainer.

And yet there are several unambiguous signs that the Arm revolution on the PC may well be imminent. Yes, for real this time. What's more, modern Arm CPUs look very compelling on paper. When it comes to single-core performance, all the indications are that they are actually superior to x86. And single-core performance is particularly important for gaming. Anyway, if the Snapdragon X has been a disappointment, that's perhaps as much down to unrealistic expectations as it is any failings of Snapdragon X or Arm CPUs more generally.

Instead of taming wild animals, you transform into monsters you've \"recorded\" to cassette tapes. There's also the fusion system, where any two monster forms can be mixed and matched to get new ones complete with original pixel art and a mashed-up name.

The escalation of gaudy, overpriced cosmetics created a distaste so palpable that Call of Duty had to desperately change its game plan. The two biggest shooters this year cost money, and there were no major free-to-play releases. The theme of this new era, as I see it developing so far, is remembering that shooters can be both casual and thrilling. High fun, low emotional investment. An old guard of life-consuming live-service games remains a vibrant and popular part of this genre, but they're once again sharing the space with—and even adopting the attributes of—a more casual breed.

It's like being friends with a sentient Steam Discover, but for some reason I can only recommend games where we're each given a Barbie and a pile of Legos. This year didn't leave me with a lack of things to talk about, either. If anything, it was almost too busy for even the most enthusiastic of survival crafting sickos. I spent months bouncing between my sandstorm-battered home in Dune: Awakening, then bug-infested dwellings in Grounded 2, and cobbled-together cubicles of Abiotic Factor. It's just, well, I really love the thrill of collecting giant piles of junk. Then there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of taking all that junk and turning it into things. And if you give me a monotonous little chore to do on the side? That's just icing on the cake. It's an unfortunate way to be when most games checking those boxes have no clear end, though it does explain why I've got a growing list of survival crafting playgrounds I'm taking with me into 2026.

The problem is, I've been utterly spoilt for choice this year. As well as officially reviewing numerous mice, ergonomic keyboards, motherboards, RAM kits, processors, and all kinds of other hardware, I've also used a range of PC products for testing game performance and just as part of my collection of test rigs in the office. Some of them I've bought myself, others have been kindly provided by hardware companies (and let me take this opportunity to directly thank MSI, Asus, and Corsair on that note).

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. For all its efforts to streamline the extraction shooter genre and make a game that anyone can pick up and play even a year down the line, Arc Raiders has some hidden complexities. Since launch, we've been pushing the game to its limits and have already discovered a number of odd quirks. While some make sense if you really think about it, most of them you'd never have guessed. Whether it's cheeky movement tech that'll give you a leg up Topside, skills not quite functioning how they should (or just being very weak), or the confusing way friendly fire works, it's all useful information to have stored in your brain. But not every tip you hear from other players is true. Below, I've picked a handful of Arc Raiders myths, and you'll have to figure out which ones are true and which are false. And if you guess wrong, you'll learn some surprisingly handy facts that'll keep you breathing next time you go to the surface, so it's a win-win.",

AMD and Intel released their latest generation of processors in 2024 ( Ryzen 9000 , Core Ultra 200S ), and the first series of motherboards that came with them were all sporting the high-end chipsets (i.e. X870/870E and Z890). The mainstream chipsets (AMD's B850 and Intel's B860) didn't really appear in great numbers until the start of this year.

AMD announced them at CES , and we didn't have to wait too long before we saw mighty APUs in use in the Framework Desktop and even in some handhelds . The real surprise was the Ryzen 5 7500X3D .

    "body": "Occasionally, on one of my rare jaunts out into the real world, someone will ask me what I do for a living. \"I write for PC Gamer,\" I invariably respond. \"Oh that's cool,\" comes the reply. \"I'd like to buy a gaming PC, but I looked at the prices recently and…\" You get the idea. I'm also constantly asked by gamers, both online and in the real world, what PC they should buy on a budget, and my response often starts with: \"What do you mean by budget?\" We exist in a space where an \"affordable\" gaming PC usually costs the best part of $1,000, and that's before you get to the monitor, the keyboard, and all the rest of it. Budget by PC gaming standards, sure. Budget by almost any other? Not really. It's a lot of cash, no matter which way you look at it. And now, thanks to a memory pricing crisis that looks destined to become much, much worse before it has any hope of getting better, those budget rigs are starting to become even more expensive. Our hobby has always had a gatekeeping aspect to the price of entry, but now? It's becoming downright ridiculous. You can still buy a sub-$1,000 prebuilt with great specs, but that's while current stocks last. All indications suggest that, come 202…",

    "body": "Persona is a series defined by its calendar system. Everything revolves around it: the school schedule, dungeon deadlines, and social events. So what happens when you try and stuff that core gameplay system-shaped peg into a gacha-shaped hole? Well, you don't. Instead, you remove it. Persona 5: The Phantom X still retains some kind of calendar, but set dates have been swapped out for a far more vague \"yesterday, today, tomorrow\" system. It makes sense for a game that is constantly shifting and changing with story and character updates, but making that move wasn't an easy one. \"Initially it was very difficult to convince the team that we needed to get rid of the calendar system,\" Chief Producer Yohsuke Uda tells me. \"When we created the game the most important thing we wanted to do was maintain that Persona 5 gameplay and game feel. But if we kept the calendar system from Persona 5, there might be differences in how each player played the game and some people might be on a different date. So it would be difficult to make sure everyone had the same experience.\" (Image credit: SEGA) Uda says that ditching that for a broader system was key to being able to \"maintain that Persona 5 fee…",
