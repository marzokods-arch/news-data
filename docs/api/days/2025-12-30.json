The event is expected to take place a little later this time, with the Galaxy S26 reveal reportedly pushed back a few weeks. Today, though, a new leak is giving us a good idea of what the phones’ finalized hardware will look like. According to a couple of posts by OnLeaks on Twitter , the Galaxy S26 series will look more than a little like the Galaxy S25 series. One notable difference, though, is that the forthcoming phones’ camera bumps will look like the ones on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones, with three individual camera lenses enclosed in a pill-shaped camera bump.",

The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers. We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",

Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020. The date, combined with the bubble-like appearance of the galaxies and the superheated gas seen with Chandra observations (represented in purple), inspired the scientists to nickname the galaxy cluster the Champagne Cluster, a much easier-to-remember name than its official designation of RM J130558.9+263048.4. The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters. Two clumps of individual galaxies making up the colliding clusters can be seen toward the top and bottom of center. (The image has been …",

Android gaming handheld launches have been feeling a little shaky lately, and the KONKR Pocket FIT is the latest example. Despite being announced ahead of its closest rival, the Pocket FIT Elite now won’t ship until after the Chinese New Year holiday, which in 2026 runs through early March. AYANEO confirmed the delay in a new Indiegogo update posted today. While shipments of the standard Pocket FIT G3 Gen 3 are still moving through January, the company says the Elite model has been pushed back due to “multiple recent supply chain disruptions,” with no firm shipping date beyond the Chinese New Year window.",

The company claims it can store more than 500 photos and offer up to 400 days of battery life on a single charge. Early crowdfunders can order a PicPak for around $49 on Kickstarter. As color E Ink continues to try to escape the shadow of e-readers , the PicPak is the latest attempt to see where else the technology can go. The tiny E Ink display acts as a trendy, miniature digital picture frame you can fill up and forget about, thanks to extended battery life and storage for more than 500 images. In other words, it may just be the low-maintenance answer to the constant question of what to do with all the photos sitting in your camera roll.

It will retail for $549 starting in February, but is available now at a discount on Kickstarter for early adopters. TCL’s Note A1 NXTPAPER has officially launched today with a full spec sheet. New details reveal what makes the device stand out and help clarify its place in the current market. Rather than competing head-on with minimalist E-Ink tablets or fully fledged tablets, it’s designed to be faster and more flexible than E-Ink, but still easier on the eyes than a typical LCD slate. At the center, the device’s 11.5-inch NXTPAPER Pure display uses a 3:2 aspect ratio with a 2200 × 1440 resolution. It supports 16.7 million colors, reaches 300 nits of typical brightness, and refreshes at up to 120Hz, giving it a clear responsiveness advantage over E-Ink alternatives.

Both of these features are currently unavailable and could be intended for the Galaxy S26 Ultra to mark it as a high-end tool for camera enthusiasts. Leaks so far paint a disappointing picture for the Galaxy S26 , but Samsung seems to have grander plans for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. While the camera hardware may remain unchanged for yet another year, Samsung could be working on enhancing the camera experience with features such as reduced lens flare , support for professional lens controllers , APV codec , and more.

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit.

Dialing up the brightness, we see what appears to be a vacuum with a new arm-and-wheel locomotion system. We’re just about one week away from CES 2026 getting started, and tech companies have already been lining up to tease their new hardware announcements ahead of time. Last year, at CES 2025, we saw Roborock push the limits on what we’ve come to expect from robot vacuum hardware with the reveal of the Saros Z70 and its articulated arm for picking up small items. Today we’re getting a preview of how Roborock is planning to follow that one up, and it sure looks like the next frontier for the company’s vacuums could be navigating stairs.

Even after years of being outclassed by other rivals, Samsung refuses to give up on its smart assistant, Bixby . Now that all smart assistants are being upgraded with AI, Samsung has similar expectations for Bixby, too. But instead of developing a solution in-house, the tech giant is partnering with an OpenAI rival to execute complex commands given to Bixby, in a similar fashion to how Apple has integrated ChatGPT into Siri . Samsung has seemingly begun experimenting with Bixby powered by Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT rival that takes a research-first approach, accessing the web and blending other LLMs for responses. This integration was first mentioned last month by a leaker and now appears to be taking form. Based on a screenshot shared by user @achultra on X (via SammyGuru ), Bixby appears to be delivering some responses powered by Perplexity.",

    "body": "Credit: Weibo / OnePlus TL;DR OnePlus has officially revealed the design and some specifications of the upcoming Turbo 6 and the Turbo 6V. The phones are (or at least one of them is) slated to arrive with a 9,000 mAh battery. OnePlus has also confirmed the 165Hz refresh rate display and Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. The duo is set to launch in China on January 8 and may be exclusive to the market. However, they are rumored to launch globally under the Nord series. OnePlus is moving forward with its new phone series, the OnePlus Turbo , with the first official teaser revealing the design. Earlier today, Li Jie Louis, OnePlus’ president for the Chinese market, shared a series of images on Weibo showcasing the upcoming phone from various angles and in different colors. The teasers also indicate the particular phone will be called OnePlus Turbo 6. Since Turbo is expected to be limited to China, the naming reinforces the likelihood that it will be rebranded as the Nord 6 for a global release. Notably, there are two different phones: the Tubro 6 and another Turbo 6V, the latter of which seems like a stripped-down version of the primary model.",

Before I braced myself for the cold, I did some quick math to set my expectations. “My Newtonian telescope has a 750 mm focal length, just bright enough to make out nebulae and galaxies on a dark night, such as Andromeda, with a 28mm lens (27x magnification).",

As convenient as wireless charging can be, it’s proving to be just as much of a headache in terms of compatibility , but without the fast charging times to help justify it. However, whenever I pick a new phone to be my daily driver or recommend a new model to friends and family, I’ve recently started making sure they come with robust wireless charging capabilities.

Moreover, routers haven’t become easier to use or included any exciting new features in the past decade. In fact, I’ve been disappointed by the lack of innovation by companies like Google that have only gone as far as making smartphone apps for easier setup or improving mesh connectivity. So when I came across the Beryl AX — a Wi-Fi router claiming to disrupt the status quo on both, price and features — it piqued my interest. The device in question comes from a relatively young manufacturer, GL.iNet, that has mostly built its reputation on compact routers over the past few years. And on paper, it’s quite the disruptor: it can fit in a pocket, has 2.5Gbit Ethernet, uses USB-C for power, and packs more useful software features than routers that cost hundreds of dollars.",

    "body": "TL;DR Surging memory prices are expected to increase smartphone prices in 2026. The Xiaomi 17 Ultra looks like it’ll be the first phone affected. RAM and storage demand is being inflated by AI data centers. Data centers powering AI software have been gobbling up memory supplies in recent months, driving up the cost of both flash storage and RAM. This memory crunch is leading to higher manufacturing costs for consumer goods like smartphones, and new reporting suggests that big players like Samsung and Apple will raise prices on their 2026 releases to keep up. Korean-language outlet Aju News reports that the upcoming Xiaomi 17 Ultra will be the first major smartphone release to come with a price hike caused by the current memory shortage; the phone is expected to cost 10% more than Xiaomi 15 Ultra that was released in March. The report goes on to say that the next generation of smartphones generally, including the Galaxy S26 and iPhone 18, will also see higher launch prices.",

Both the Samsung Wide Fold and the foldable iPhone are expected to debut in the fall of 2026, competing head-to-head. Samsung has long been rumored to be working on a wide-screen foldable , potentially as a preemptive response to Apple’s upcoming iPhone Fold . Since Apple is reportedly adopting a wider cover display , even Samsung plans to join the fray, despite pioneering taller cover displays with the Galaxy Z Fold lineup.

Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",
