This is a Remedy game, after all. I don't remember a huge amount about its combat except that there's a lot of dashing, a lot of offensive levitating, and somehow office furniture is always involved. What I do remember well is the setting: Control is an action game, but it's also a very arch horror game set in the austere pebblecrete hallways of a brutalist tower called The Oldest House. Control's story and setting is often compared to the fictional SCP Foundation, which is basically hyper-conspiratorial crowdsourced weird fiction that has also inspired stuff like Lethal Company . I don't know how much more I can say to sell Control to you, and it's probably a waste of time anyway because money talks: Control is $4 on Steam at the moment.

The scene would be unrecognizable without all the indie hits that first found a home on Steam, and early attempts to mimic that plumber in the red hat led to the tech that gave us Doom. So dust off that gamepad and embrace the inherent fun of jumping over stuff with me. It's a genre largely unbeleaguered by big-budget bloat, intent on retaining the purity of old-school action at its best. Platformers remain fascinated with the ability of the videogame to sate a primordial human urge: to run, be free, and soar weightlessly over certain doom. From cerebral puzzle platformers, to parkour simulations, to cotton candy collectathons, the genre is as diverse and worth celebrating as it’s ever been.

    "body": "Remember the glory days of CGI in movies? Terminator 2's liquid metal T-1000, Jurassic Park's stunning dinosaurs, Starship Trooper's swarms of giant arachnids. Not only did the CGI look great then, most of the visual effects in those movies still hold up well today, even decades after they were created. Nowadays, movie fans seem much less impressed by CGI in films. There's a general distaste for a perceived overuse of CGI in favor of practical effects, and there are a lot of complaints that recent CGI is less-convincing and more fake-looking than it used to be, even in the biggest budget films. In an interview with But Why Tho? , Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, Rango, and the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, was asked why visual effects in movies just don't look as good as they used to. \"I think the simplest answer is you’ve seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said. \"So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects. So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema.\" Unreal Engine m…",

It was a sticky situation for a while: Riot's decision to cancel Hytale and close Hypixel Studios after seven years of work (and for reasons that will probably never be entirely clear) seemed a definitive end to the story, but a seemingly faint hope that someone would step in to save the day became reality when Collins-Laflamme struck a deal to reacquire the whole thing in November 2025. The reborn studio managed to get the game out the door just two months later, and while it's still notably very early access, it's also pretty good . \"It’s now been 7 days since early access launch and I can confidently say that I have no regrets saving Hytale, it’s been the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life,\" Collins-Laflamme wrote. \"Thank you everyone for the amazing support, and a big thank you for the rebuilt Hytale…",

He posted a screenshot on X confirming the game will launch with 280 achievements, which is a lot. pic.twitter.com/lmpJxF0wqn January 19, 2026 While there are plenty of games on Steam with more than 280 achievements, a lot of them are either a) games with a heap of post-launch updates that have added more achievements over time, or b) terrible achievement-farming shovelware. Some examples of the former include Team Fortress 2, which has 520 achievements, and Payday 2, which has a frankly ridiculous 1328.

But the Fez-like era never really happened and I've been left to wonder what it might be like to play something even half as clever. Cassette Boy is the closest I've ever got to playing a game that might actually rival Fez. While it lacks Tetris blocks and made-up languages, it's full of similarly mysterious characters and puzzles to uncover as you spin every level around in search of answers. The moon is gone and you, a small boy made of white cubes, are on a mission to find it. Cassette Boy begins as a legally distinct Zelda clone—you pull a sword out of a stone in the first five minutes—and transforms into something else the moment you have the power to turn the world around as many times as you'd like. Just like in Fez, the ability to peek behind solid objects, like houses and trees, in what you thought was a 2D world is an arcane power that only the strangest characters you meet seem to acknowledge.

Transfers require a token, which every player has been given, and that token will replenish a week after using it. In other words, you'll get one server transfer per week. Players have been clambering for server transfers for a while now: for some it's because the world they started playing on no longer has enough players and feels like a ghost town, or because one particular faction is dominating the Landsraad, or because their friends have moved onto other games and they're looking for some new blood.

These areas have distinctive blue trees, blueish grass (azure, you could say), and you'll often find lots of small ponds or rivers cutting through them. You can easily spot azure forests on your map, so zoom in to check if there's any water before trekking over. Search the bodies of water and you should find azure kelp, a bright blue plant that shimmers and often pokes out of the water. Since it's a plant, press F to harvest it.

    "body": "Here's one that didn't show up on the CES 2026 show floor. Asus has some new dual-mode 4K monitors with uprated, higher-refresh 1080p modes . We've seen plenty of 4K dual-mode monitors before. But thus far, the 1080p alt mode has run at precisely twice the refresh rate of the panel's native 4K setting. But now Asus is launching two new monitors with 1080p modes that run at 3x and 4x the refresh of their respective 4K modes. By way of example, I reviewed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG last summer . That's a 27-inch 4K model that hits 160 Hz at 4K and therefore 320 Hz at 1080p. Now there's a new version of that display, dubbed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG Gen 2. As before, it'll do 160 Hz at 4K, but now hits 480 Hz at 1080p. That latter figure should be enough to satisfy pretty serious esports gamers and in turn allow the XG27UCG Gen 2 to offer the best of both worlds in terms of 4K image detail and 1080p speed. The other newcomer is the Asus TUF Gaming VG27UQEL5A. That's another 27-inch 4K model, but this time with a native 75 Hz 4K mode and a 4x 1080p 300 Hz mode.

As reported by The Hacker News , ReliaQuest recently spotted a phishing scam that prompts a user to download a self-extracting archive . It reportedly comes with deceptive names like \"Upcoming_Products.pdf\" and has an attached open-source PDF reader app. In many cases, this download would come with an uncompromised RAR file, which might make the parent folder seem real. When the reader boots it up, the file sideloads a malicious DLL file, which is placed in the same directory as legitimate ones. This not only evades detection but makes the downloaded file seem totally genuine as a result. That means one could go some time without realising their PC has been compromised. Once up and running, that malicious DLL file pops a Python interpreter onto the system, which runs a script to create a registry Run key. This ensures that the Python interpreter is active on login to the system, and can even give remote access to the user. From there, bad actors can take information from the machine.

Then there's the Stella Montis kinda-fix, which is an issue that's been hanging around in the game for a couple months: players anecdotally report that Embark has been replacing items for players particularly caught-out by this, though it's an open question whether certain spots persist for ne'er-do-wells to take advantage of.

With four Zen 5 cores and eight Zen 5c cores, and clocking in at a max boost clock of 5.2 GHz, it's a pretty powerful chip. Previously, Ayaneo's Konkr range has relied on Snapdragon chips, namely the G3 Gen 3 or 8 Elite. This is a step above the Android-based OS of the Snapdragon Pocket Fit . Built-in Windows support gives the handheld a boost in terms of compatibility with vast libraries of games on Steam and anti-cheat. If you're confused on the naming, the Konkr Fit is the one with an AMD chip, Windows operating system, and a larger frame. It comes with a seven-inch OLED screen. The Konkr Pocket Fit is Android-based, smaller, and presumably cheaper, with this model ranging from $299 to $329. The Pocket Fit comes with a six-inch LCD display. They look nearly identical but the Windows model is clearly much larger when viewed side-by-side. We've liked Ayaneo devices …",

The Carouser's power is that when his balls return to him, they spin in a circle around him, which should make him particularly powerful at close range. Meanwhile the Falconer fires her balls from two birds on either side of her, who seem to sit against the walls of the stage and shoot inwards—a bit like a remix of the Cohabitants. The true Ball X Pit fiends among you will already be thinking of possible combos with other character powers.

Rather than simply strapping all of the hardware together (which the YouTuber demonstrates would be both unwieldy and weigh a hefty 10 kg), she stripped everything down to its electrical components and completely rethought the hardware's housing.

So says the Gambling Commission, a government body that regulates gambling services and activities in the UK. Very likely, few will be surprised by this conclusion. During a speech at the ICE Barcelona trade show (via Reuters ), the Gambling Commission's executive director Tim Miller said that anyone who has spent \"even a little time\" on Facebook or Instagram will have been served ads for illegal online casinos. Miller explained that Meta claims to remove any such ads when notified of their existence. But that implies Meta is unaware of these ads until being alerted to them by third parties. \"That is simply false,\" he said. According to Miller, Meta even tried to shift responsibility for sorting this all out onto the Gambling Commission. \"Their suggestion was that we should deploy AI tools ourselves to monitor and find these ads and then report them,\" he said. Miller also described Meta's searchable ad library as \"a window into criminality.\" All of this lead Miller to conclude, \"it could leave you with the impression they are quite happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking …",

When asked how Razer decides which projects actually become real projects, Tan says: \"We very rarely sit down with the finance people and say, 'Oh, do we do projections and things like that?' It’s really more of a 'by the seat of our pants' kind of thing. It's cool, we like it, it's gonna be fun, we want it for ourselves. I think the real kind of trigger there is, do we want it for ourselves? And if we really want it for ourselves, and we think it's cool, we'll bring it to market.\" Naturally, this leads Nilay Patel, the editor in chief of The Verge, to ask about what he calls the 'holographic anime waifu'.

Alas, it turns out that we were all just very naive, and Microsoft's software engineers had deliberately coded this functionality. Yes, I know that's blatantly obvious—it's not like Windows 95 was created out of mystic spells and ground up weevils—but back then, there was surprisingly little in the way of information about the inner workings of Windows, let alone any comprehensive guides to every function and feature. In his Old New Thing blog , Raymond Chen explains the 'secret sauce' behind what was going on with the whole shift+restart trick. Just as it does now in all versions of Windows, clicking on restart in Microsoft's then massively updated Windows 95 forced the PC to initiate a cold reboot, i.e. shutdown all processes, clear the memory, and cycle the hardware. However, holding down the shift key forced a different process: the PC wouldn't restart, just the operating system itself, displaying 'Windows is restarting' o…",

That's right, how long it'll take you to get the voidhearts you need is largely down to luck. To help you out, I'll go over the best methods of getting voidhearts below.

A number of remedies were proposed, including Google's divestment of the Chrome browser (which will ultimately not come to pass ), and most pertinently right now that the search giant shares its data with rival companies. The DOJ secured this latter remedy among others back in September , with the US District Court ordering \"Google to make certain search index and user-interaction data available to rivals and potential rivals.\" Google is now asking to postpone the sharing of this data while it appeals the DOJ's ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly.

In the case of Intel's 12th Gen Core processors, the end officially started at the beginning of 2026, with January 22, 2027 being the final date for the shipment of any 12th Gen chips. The fact that I am only writing about this now suggests that PC enthusiasts are perhaps not all that interested in these CPUs, but they should be and for good reasons. First of all, the Alder Lake architecture marked Intel's first attempt at implementing a hybrid core design in desktop processors (it had done so previously with mobile-only Lakefield in 2020). Sporting the monikers of Performance and Efficient core (aka P-core and E-core), with the former handling the donkey work in games and the latter used for background tasks or weighing in with thread-heavy workloads, the markedly different core designs have remained front and centre in Intel's approach to all its consumer CPUs. All the 'Lakes' since the launch of 12th Gen Core have been hybrid, with the latest iterations ( Arrow Lake and Panther Lake ) boasting so…",

Your boss had the good sense to stay home, but you are not alone: Before long you're not only preparing the deceased for their funerals, you're also conducting occult rituals to ward off demonic forces. Talk about multi-tasking! I suppose it's inevitable at this point, three years after the release of the game, but the trailer for the film adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant doesn't land quite as well for me as the game did.

The accompanying blog post states it \"represents more than a milestone; it’s a turning point—one that sets RuneScape firmly on course for the future it deserves.\" The plans detailed in the post are already in motion, as Treasure Hunter is already out of the game.

It might look from the outside like the whole thing is floundering, but it appears that the wheels are turning, or at least that someone is revving the engine with intent: Riot has now added former World of Warcraft lead producer Raymond Bartos to its MMO development team. \"From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values—and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process,\" Bartos wrote on LinkedIn (via MassivelyOP ). \"It made it obvious that kindness, respect, and care aren’t just words here, but something the team truly lives by. \"I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can’t wait to get started—showing up every day to provide value for…",

While I could treat myself to a funky, chunky, mains-powered USB hub, I'm kind of longing for something just a little dinkier—and flexible. Enter the DockFrame , a USB-C hub with modular ports you can swap out. Though not officially affiliated, the project is designed to work with the hot-swappable hardware standard used by Framework's expansion cards . A custom PCB is both compatible with any Framework USB-C modules you may have lying around as well as the DockFrame's own 'Tool Cards.' These Tool Cards are a little extra, planning to offer functionality beyond the I/O ports you'd traditionally see on a desktop—such as voltage measuring and even adjustable voltage output. The project remains a ways off, but it's intended to be usable with both Framework laptops, non-Framework machines, and even your smartphone.

    "body": "When Xgimi released the MoGo 4 Laser projector, a little light switched on in my brain. Three, actually. This versatile little tri-laser beamer seeks to follow your lead, and light up your life with a cornucopia of practical portability features. I wouldn't say you're looking at a projector as much as you're looking at a technological druid packing the Wild Shape spell. In all my years of reviewing tech it's become painfully clear that a plentiful feature set usually points to at least a couple of small caveats. No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer. Any piece of tech that can shift from projector, to soundbar, to fancy lightshow with the flick of some far-out mechanism gives me a palpable dopamine hit. That's what Xgimi is pandering to with the MoGo 4 Laser: tech fiends with a penchant for adaptable equipment. At any moment, a swift attachment of one of the…",
