So you can bet how excited I was when I got my mitts on Corsair's new 36 ( thirty-six! ) gram gaming mouse, the Sabre V2 Pro. I first saw the Corsair Sabre V2 Pro at Gamescom, but I was told I couldn't speak about it until its launch today. Which, let me tell you, was a difficult ask, because it's thirty-six grams , for pity's sake. How can I keep quiet about a 36 g, non-holey, wireless gaming mouse that seemed—based on my few minutes using it back then—pretty comfortable? Somehow I kept it zipped, though, and I've now had some more time with the mouse. Not enough for a complete picture, mind, just a couple of hours dusting off the cobwebs in a Dust_2 deathmatch last night. And as I suspected, I am smitten, just like I was with the Logitech G Pro X Superlight when that launched. Back then, circa 2020–2021, the Superlight stunned me because it's a wireless mouse that managed to weigh in at just 63 g without the whole holey thing going on. I'm not even a trypophobe, I just like my mice nice and, er, whole, th…",

Oh, and Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel. Hold that thought. The announcement says the partnership will span both enterprise-class AI products and consumer PCs. It's the latter we're most interested in, of course, so here's what the statement has to say about that specifically: \"For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.\" And that really is it, barring some platitudes rolled out by Intel and Nvidia's CEOs, Lip Bu Tan and Jensen Huang respectively.

Cool stuff, but when it came to the demos, things didn't exactly go to plan.

Already, we've found the reprised iconic Doom-inspired Hellwalker shotgun, the pleasantly-named Rainbow Vomit that covers all your elemental needs, and the Slippy , a fish grenade. Of all the 150-odd legendaries discovered so far, though, one has taken the cake as the most ridiculous: the Kickballer . When paired with a Jakobs licensed part and enhancement, you can get this shotgun to infinitely bounce projectiles around the room, nuking everything on the screen. More often than not, that also includes you, which can get pretty awkward as there's usually nothing left standing for you to kill to revive yourself. But what if I told you that there was another way? Some other shotgun that does brain-breaking damage that won't kill you in the process, and is somehow a random-ass purple item? Well, there is, it's the Quincunx Stellium , a Maliwan shotgun. As showcased by content creator Moxsy…",

This humble plant actually has multiple quests dedicated to it, including a special Act 2 ending you can achieve if you're willing to finish the game with the bud's restrictions active (and I'm not just talking about the screaming). If you'd rather not deal with the bud, you can also infect yourself and then have it removed, which will get you the Witch Crest. For all you Elden Ring fans out there, think of it a little like getting infected with the Flame of Frenzy—you can get a unique ending, or return to normal via a questline. Below, I'll explain where to find the Twisted Bud, how to use it, and then how to remove it once you immediately regret doing that so you can get the Witch Crest.

As a heads up, to acquire this weapon, you'll have to progress through the first area in the campaign until you unlock Terminus Range. You won't be able to farm the shotgun right after waking up to Claptrap yapping in your ears, though it'll only take a few hours of progress to get to where you need to be. How to get the Hellwalker in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get the Hellwalker by farming the Saddleback and Immortal Boneface bosses in The Old Scrape dig site in Cuspid Climb, Terminus Range . This dig site is close to the entrance to Terminus Range from the starting Fadefields region—just follow the main road and turn right at the fork to head south, past a silo.

Due to be unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show 2025 , it's a completely wireless mouse that uses EMR or electromagnetic resonance technology for both tracking and power. That allows wireless operation without the need for a battery or an optical sensor. Full specs haven't been released, but the basics involve a 1,000 Hz polling rate and a resolution of 0.01 mm. For now, the mouse's weight isn't quoted, but without batteries and the sensor, there's potential for ultra light weight. But how does it all work? There's a handy video on YouTube from an unrelated source to this Mirai Create mouse. But the video explains the technology neatly.

    "body": "Dying Light: The Beast is a game about what it's like to try to parkour your way through an undead apocalypse after you've spent years getting injected with zombie juice. Based on the reactions and vengeful affect of returning Dying Light 1 protagonist Kyle Crane, it seems the juice was bad. And yet it helps you kill zombies, so it might be good? Such are the fascinating moral complexities offered by zombie fiction. Perhaps the true beast… is humanity!? Or it's the guy with experimental zombie super strength who can rip mutants apart with his bare hands. Hard to say. If you're desperate to learn when you'll be able to go Beast mode in the latest Dying Light, don't fret: You won't have to endure years of zombie DNA experimentation. We've got the launch times for Dying Light: The Beast collected below. When does Dying Light: The Beast unlock? Big news! Since more than 1 million players have already secured their copy of Dying Light: The Beast ahead of launch, we're moving the release forward to SEPTEMBER 18!

    "body": "If Hollow Knight: Silksong is too easy for you, or you've finished it and want further punishment, there is a much more difficult way to play it: on Steel Soul Mode . In the original Hollow Knight, accessing Steel Soul Mode meant defeating the main game at least once. In Silksong the same is true, except there is also another easier and quicker way to unlock it too. But first, what is it? Steel Soul Mode is basically a permadeath mode for Silksong. When you die it's game over, and if you try to re-access the save file you'll be asked if you want to overwrite it. There's no going back, and as a result some items related to death have also changed in Steel Soul mode. For example: the Dead Bug's Purse, a tool which lets you retain half of your rosaries on death, becomes a Shell Satchel, which increases Hornet's tool pouch size. If Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode is any indication, there will also be some minor changes and additions in the adventure that will make the punishment worthwhile for completionists. How to unlock Steel Soul Mode in Silksong The most legitimate way of unlocking Steel Soul mode in Silksong is to simply complete the main game. But if you want to dive straight i…",

    "body": "Before booting up Zexion on my Steam Deck last weekend, I made a grievous error: I looked it up on YouTube and saw that someone had finished the game in three hours. Did I immediately intuit, as someone well-versed in the sicko behavior of gaming speedrunners, that three hours was probably a really fast clear time for this indie game with its throwback 8-bit graphics that includes its own built-in randomizer? Of course not. \"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere near finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me. Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight—and the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.

But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff. Blizzard quickly issued a response , saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing. Sure enough, the next PTR had a long list of changes that essentially removed all of the gear …",

There, they were met with the Rupture strain: new varieties of burrowing bug enemies that proved to be an immediate source of controversy by mercilessly kicking people's asses. Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts . While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons. Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for everyone else. You'll be shocked to learn, I'm sure, that players didn't receive this news well . Evidently, even with the Rupture Warrior lethality …",

Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range—which looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set. Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree.

Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t…",

The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation.

But the lesson learnt from Battlefield 4 was: sometimes less destruction is more. (Image credit: EA) But even so, the decision was made to scale back on the all-out map demolition in the form of Levolution events, which were present in Battlefield 4, as the devs wanted to ensure that any map destruction in Battlefield 6 would \"serve a gameplay purpose.\" Instead, the choice was made to come up with a new feature called \"tactical destruction\". \"We want people to be flanking by destroying things, to take down a building to eliminate an enemy,\" Grass continues. \"If you could destroy everything, once there's nothing left, then the game wouldn't be fun.\" All the Levolution events could be pure chaos when triggered.

Teams enter the tower, gain abilities from memory-haunted weapons and equipment, and compete to climb higher before the current floor is destroyed until one team eventually stands triumphant at the tower's apex.

The leaks, all communicated inexplicably in French, suggest that, well, this is very much an AC game, folks. But not an AC game in the old style—as the original Black Flag was—rather, Ubi is crowbarring its new, Witcher-3-by-another-name RPG style onto the classic pirate sim. Anticipate loot and an inventory, and combat that hews closer to a (much easier) soulslike than the choreographed combat of yore. Which I gotta admit, I'm a little sad about. As one of perhaps seven people worldwide who maintain that AC: Unity showed the direction the series ought to have gone in, I rather liked Ubi's old approach to AC, and only grudgingly tolerate the new, RPG-flavoured direction.

Even though I've played dozens of hours of multiplayer at this point, this Battlefield 6 demo felt personally make-or-break: EA's focus on small maps (and one medium) in the open beta was a letdown, and it helped fuel the impression that it's more interested in converting Call of Duty players than winning back Battlefield long-timers. That's still probably true—Battlefield 6 is following Call of Duty's model so closely that it's got the same gunsmith system, the same small-scale modes, and the same battle royale spinoff in the works—but Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm are the best evidence yet that this is still Battlefield to the core.

Chris Hall, Senior Director Software Development and head of AMD's ROCm project, which is a software stack for AI development and roughly equivalent to Nvidia's CUDA platform, explained that FSR Redstone—which could be called FSR 5 when it hopefully releases later this year—was developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). Apparently, FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology is \"converted\" into compute Shader code. \"This means that FSR Redstone's neural rendering core can also run on GPUs made by other companies,\" Hall said (via machine translation). In other words, it doesn't require AI or matrix math cores, just as Nvidia's DLSS technology requires Tensor cores. It can run on conventional GPU shaders. \"ML2CODE-based frameworks, such as FSR Redstone, can be seamlessly integrated directly into DirectX or Vulkan graphics pipelines with minimal latency.

The front plate, thumbsticks, and face buttons can be swapped out and replaced. The red model we tested came with three included D-pads, but only the one face plate. As well as coming with programmable paddle buttons at the bottom, the G7 Pro has two near the top bumper, and, most importantly, the thumbsticks are Hall effect, which means you can say goodbye to drift.

For anyone who's been following that early access journey, the 1.0 release won't come as any startling reinvention. But it's a really confident fleshing out of the structure and features around that excellent core gameplay loop, and the result is that a roguelik…",

They booted up Doom on an old PDA, expecting it to crash at some point. That's because every time the game demo would run and then reset, the engine would store a new variable. Then it'd start up again, and again store a new variable. All in one long string until, blam-o, it'd crash due to an overflow—the data exceeding the possible bounds of the value used to store it. Though how long it'd take to crash was all theoretical, until it wasn't. Minki ran a physical test on an old PDA—you don't need much to run Doom, as proven by that time someone played it in a PDF file , or a badge for a hacking conference , or even on its own box . They then left the game running, which would cause the demo to loop over and over, to see how long it'd take to crash.

They aren't strictly necessary (I'm not sure they all count towards 100% completion), but each one is a challenge you'll want to encounter if you're a completionist. These mementos aren't available until Act 3, mainly because the quests don't spawn, or you don't have the relevant movement abilities like Silk Soar. Below, I'll explain how to get every memento. Obviously, this will contain some spoilers for Act 3 content , though not really in regard to the main story itself.

The main library aggregation update rolled out to Insiders a few months ago, but it looks like it's now being released to non-Insiders in regular updates. Those considering using aggregator apps like Playnite , in other words, might not need to do so anymore because they'll be able to use the Xbox app to view their entire game library, not just games bought on the Xbox app itself. This will \"show your installed games from multiple PC storefronts, including your Xbox library, Xbox Game Pass, Battle.net and other leading PC storefronts.\" Getting to those storefronts should be easier, too, as you can use the new 'My Apps' tab in your library to house Battle.net and so on.

Throughout the demo you'll also get to play as the new protagonists, Low and Alone, both of whom boast different weapons you'll have to figure out how to use.

The kicker is that all you need to do is punch. The goal is to stack as much bonus damage as possible from Berserk (cryo) and Groundbreaker (kinetic). You might question how we benefit from Groundbreaker, since it only triggers on non-melee damage, but the bonus cryo damage applied to melee from Berserk actually does the trick.
