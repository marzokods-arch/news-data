Where to find Noodle Grass in Hello Kitty Island Adventure Noodle Grass can be found throughout the grassy areas of Wheatflour Wonderland. In the rolling fields where the wheat grows, Noodle Grass will spawn around the edges. It's a tall plant with curly yellow stalks.

Fortunately they are easy to find and spawn in huge numbers so you'll be crafting in no time. Wheatflour Wonderland is home to a lot of different gemstones that you'll need to collect, but Jemmies are unlike any of the bigger stones you'll come across. They're small clusters of coloured gemstones that appear on the ground rather than big glittery stones. Here's where you need to go if you want to collect some.

After all, there are so many characters in Sanrio's wheelhouse that deserve a place in the game and that so many people already love. However, the announcement of the game's first DLC, Wheatflour Wonderland , still surprised me. It wasn't until I got into the magical new realm that I realised DLCs like this open up a whole new set of possibilities for Hello Kitty Island Adventure, and frankly I am shocked it's taken Sunblink this long to make one. Wheatflour Wonderland not only introduces Cogimyun, an incredibly underrated character in Sanrio's roster, but an entire new significantly sized area for you to explore, filled with new critters, ingredients, and puzzles to solve. On top of that, Wheatflour Wonderland comes with its own story involving the friends you've made, in an adventure ripped straight from Sailor Moon which would make my pink-frilled, six-year-old self sing. There's a whole lot more here than I was expecting, which‚Ä¶",

The Moflin is capable of moving and tilting its head, responding to light and touch, and listening to your darkest fantas... I mean, your vocalisations through a built-in microphone. Not only that, but it'll adjust its behaviour based on an AI-powered emotional spectrum, which Casio says allows it to \"express a diverse range of feelings.\" It can be grumpy, thrilled, joyful, anxious, lonely, calm, happy... in fact, it sounds like a right needy little git, and that's apparently part of the appeal.

Pink is far from my favourite colour, as I tend to sport a more pro-purple agenda, but I'm not eager to kick out Razer's latest iteration of the Kraken Kitty headset. Available in both white and black colourways alongside the aforementioned 'quartz', the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro headset offers more than the novelty of feline flair. Costing $180/¬£180, it had better. As with every Kraken Kitty, the cat ears remain the crown jewel of this headset. To be clear, the charming interchangeable ears of the pricy V2 Pro are gone; we're now back to full-size animal ears rather than the V2 Pro's oddly diminutive accessories throwing off the proportions of what is an already bulky headset. The kitty ears here are sturdy, solidly anchored to the headband, and immediately eye-catching. With all of that hardware on top, you may think the V3 Pro would be fatiguing to wear.

There are detailed instructions on how to set it up on your Windows handheld on Reddit, thanks to user Gogsi123 (via The Verge ).

Multiplayer?: Up to 4-player co-op. Link: Official site This is not a series that innovates, and I don't think Gearbox has reinvented the wheel here, either. What the studio has done is make the perfect wheel, then presumably gone \"crap, we spent all our budget on wheel\" and put it on a clunky used car with steering that keeps locking up. I make this assumption because the game's most glaring issues are such blunders that I simply cannot fathom how they happened‚Äîthey are legitimately baffling.

I first saw the Corsair Sabre V2 Pro at Gamescom, but I was told I couldn't speak about it until its launch today. Which, let me tell you, was a difficult ask, because it's thirty-six grams , for pity's sake. How can I keep quiet about a 36 g, non-holey, wireless gaming mouse that seemed‚Äîbased on my few minutes using it back then‚Äîpretty comfortable? Somehow I kept it zipped, though, and I've now had some more time with the mouse. Not enough for a complete picture, mind, just a couple of hours dusting off the cobwebs in a Dust_2 deathmatch last night. And as I suspected, I am smitten, just like I was with the Logitech G Pro X Superlight when that launched. Back then, circa 2020‚Äì2021, the Superlight stunned me because it's a wireless mouse that managed to weigh in at just 63 g without the whole holey thing going on.

It's the latter we're most interested in, of course, so here's what the statement has to say about that specifically: \"For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.\" And that really is it, barring some platitudes rolled out by Intel and Nvidia's CEOs, Lip Bu Tan and Jensen Huang respectively. So, what are we to make of it all? It's a pretty extraordinary announcement and it almost certainly wouldn't be happening if Intel wasn't in such deep trouble of late.

Cool stuff, but when it came to the demos, things didn't exactly go to plan. Switching over to a livestreamed demonstration, displayed to the audience on a gigantic panel at Zuckerberg's side, chef Jack Mancuso attempted to use the Live AI functionality of the smart specs to help them make a Korean-inspired steak sauce .

    "body": "Every time a new Borderlands game comes out, we all frantically farm bosses in search of cool legendary guns and gear, and that's not changed in Borderlands 4 . In fact, it's more convenient than ever thanks to Moxxi's Big Encore machines‚Äîdevices that let you retry bosses as many times as you want. Already, we've found the reprised iconic Doom-inspired Hellwalker shotgun, the pleasantly-named Rainbow Vomit that covers all your elemental needs, and the Slippy , a fish grenade. Of all the 150-odd legendaries discovered so far, though, one has taken the cake as the most ridiculous: the Kickballer . When paired with a Jakobs licensed part and enhancement, you can get this shotgun to infinitely bounce projectiles around the room, nuking everything on the screen. More often than not, that also includes you, which can get pretty awkward as there's usually nothing left standing for you to kill to revive yourself. But what if I told you that there was another way? Some other shotgun that does brain-breaking damage that won't kill you in the process, and is somehow a random-ass purple item? Well, there is, it's the Quincunx Stellium , a Maliwan shotgun. As showcased by content creator Moxsy‚Ä¶",

This humble plant actually has multiple quests dedicated to it, including a special Act 2 ending you can achieve if you're willing to finish the game with the bud's restrictions active (and I'm not just talking about the screaming). If you'd rather not deal with the bud, you can also infect yourself and then have it removed, which will get you the Witch Crest. For all you Elden Ring fans out there, think of it a little like getting infected with the Flame of Frenzy‚Äîyou can get a unique ending, or return to normal via a questline. Below, I'll explain where to find the Twisted Bud, how to use it, and then how to remove it once you immediately regret doing that so you can get the Witch Crest. Where to find the Twisted Bud in Silksong You can drop into the part of Bilewater with the Twisted Bud via a secret passage in the top right corner of this room in the Whispering Vaults (Image credit: Team Cherry) You can get the Twisted Bud in a chamber sealed off by roots in the northwest of Bilewater .

As a heads up, to acquire this weapon, you'll have to progress through the first area in the campaign until you unlock Terminus Range.

This dig site is close to the entrance to Terminus Range from the starting Fadefields region‚Äîjust follow the main road and turn right at the fork to head south, past a silo.

Oh, and while we're at it, how about ditching the optical sensor? That is the basic proposition offered by the Mirai Create Super EMR Mouse. Due to be unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show 2025 , it's a completely wireless mouse that uses EMR or electromagnetic resonance technology for both tracking and power. That allows wireless operation without the need for a battery or an optical sensor. Full specs haven't been released, but the basics involve a 1,000 Hz polling rate and a resolution of 0.01 mm. For now, the mouse's weight isn't quoted, but without batteries and the sensor, there's potential for ultra light weight. But how does it all work? There's a handy video on YouTube from an unrelated source to this Mirai Create mouse. But the video explains the technology neatly. EMR devices like this run on the same principles as Wacom's pen and digitiser pads. So, the power for the device actually comes from the pad, which contains an array of resonance circuits made up of a capacitor and an inductor coil. Wh‚Ä¶",

In celebration of five years since Hades launched into 1.0, Supergiant Games is putting on quite the party. There's a new \"In the Blood\" Anniversary mix for players to listen to, a big old sale over at Fangamer for official Hades merchandise, including pins, plushies, and t-shirts, and a huge discount on the game. \"If you've been putting off a trip to the Underworld, Hades is having its biggest sale ever,\" an official Steam blog post says . \"Why not dive in again, either for the first time or for old time's sake, and get set for Hades 2 next week; though, no prior experience is needed to enjoy the sequel!\" Hades is currently going for just $6.24/ ¬£5.24, 75% off, a few quid cheaper than its previous lowest price. It's a ridiculously good price to get Hades for, and something that I would certainly recommend taking a look at. Despite my ungodly inability ‚Ä¶",

In the original Hollow Knight, accessing Steel Soul Mode meant defeating the main game at least once. In Silksong the same is true, except there is also another easier and quicker way to unlock it too. But first, what is it? Steel Soul Mode is basically a permadeath mode for Silksong. When you die it's game over, and if you try to re-access the save file you'll be asked if you want to overwrite it. There's no going back, and as a result some items related to death have also changed in Steel Soul mode. For example: the Dead Bug's Purse, a tool which lets you retain half of your rosaries on death, becomes a Shell Satchel, which increases Hornet's tool pouch size. If Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode is any indication, there will also be some minor changes and additions in the adventure that will make the punishment worthwhile for completionists.

Did I immediately intuit, as someone well-versed in the sicko behavior of gaming speedrunners, that three hours was probably a really fast clear time for this indie game with its throwback 8-bit graphics that includes its own built-in randomizer? Of course not. \"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere near finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me. Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight‚Äîand the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.

Mists of Pandaria Remix had some hiccups early on, but Blizzard was quick to fix them and let players have their fun for the duration of the event. But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff. Blizzard quickly issued a response , saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing. Sure enough, the next PTR had a long list of changes that essentially removed all of the gear ‚Ä¶",

There, they were met with the Rupture strain: new varieties of burrowing bug enemies that proved to be an immediate source of controversy by mercilessly kicking people's asses. Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts . While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons. Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for everyone else.

A new map and quests for a two year-old game, and no charge? Such largesse is only possible thanks to the involvement of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has made many gaming investments as part of its mission to detoxify the image of the brutal petrol state. The DLC will see Basim, Mirage's protagonist, visiting AlUla, an ancient city key to Saudi Arabian culture. It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup. \"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site. As to the question of whether the DLC is being fully funded by the PIF, Ubisoft says it does \"not comment on rumours.\" It appears that Ubisoft staff are not particularly happy about the publisher getting into bed with the Saudis.

Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range‚Äîwhich looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set. Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree.

Well, Logitech has you covered; it'll just cost you $170. Will that be cash or card? Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t‚Ä¶",

The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation.

With comfortable textured grips, a great feel, a sturdy build, and a classic look, it's still a bit of a banger five years after its Xbox Series X refresh. That refresh added a new share button, and it adds a lot for someone like me who clips arguably far too much from my games. However, when we got our hands on the GameSir G7 Pro , we knew it was special, and it has now been crowned the best PC controller by us here at PC Gamer. The G7 Pro absolutely deserves the pro name. The front plate, thumbsticks, and face buttons can be swapped out and replaced. The red model we tested came with three included D-pads, but only the one face plate. As well as coming with programmable paddle buttons at the bottom, the G7 Pro has two near the top bumper, and, most importantly, the thumbsticks are Hall effect, which means you can say goodbye to drift. Stick drift is pretty much the biggest downside of the Xbox controller, but that's not the only way this little GameSir wonder comes out on top. It's super solid and has lovely, clicky buttons. ‚Ä¶",

The Kickballer fires bouncing projectiles, and when you hit a shot, it'll fire a second one for free, leading to some very high damage numbers and game-breaking visuals. However, you can't farm it right away. If you haven't been doing side content, then you've likely glossed over what you need to do without even realising it.
