I contacted Asus about this yesterday and am still waiting to hear back for more details, but in the meantime Asus ROG has released a statement on X explaining that its \"team is actively investigating these cases.\" The \"cases\" in question are \"performance interruptions on some ROG laptops,\" which Zephkek's Github analysis details. Your feedback has been heard 🤝 pic.twitter.com/2UxWiQB1KX September 17, 2025 It seems that some Asus ROG laptop owners have been experiencing stutters, freezes, and audio crackles.

Because of this, it's incredibly easy to gather a lot in a short amount of time, and once you know what you're looking for, it's hard to miss. It's a great material to pick up each time you visit Wheatflour Wonderland, since you'll need it for a number of new recipes you'll unlock later down the line. It's also a great one-star gift for Cogimyun if you're stuck for ideas. Here's what you need to do to get your hands on some Noodle Grass to take back to Friendship Island. Where to find Noodle Grass in Hello Kitty Island Adventure Noodle Grass can be found throughout the grassy areas of Wheatflour Wonderland. In the rolling fields where the wheat grows, Noodle Grass will spawn around the edges. It's a tall plant with curly yellow stalks. When you walk up to a crop and interact with it, you'll basically just trim the twisted \"heads\" of the plant and leave the stumps.

Fortunately they are easy to find and spawn in huge numbers so you'll be crafting in no time. Wheatflour Wonderland is home to a lot of different gemstones that you'll need to collect, but Jemmies are unlike any of the bigger stones you'll come across. They're small clusters of coloured gemstones that appear on the ground rather than big glittery stones. Here's where you need to go if you want to collect some.

It wasn't until I got into the magical new realm that I realised DLCs like this open up a whole new set of possibilities for Hello Kitty Island Adventure, and frankly I am shocked it's taken Sunblink this long to make one. Wheatflour Wonderland not only introduces Cogimyun, an incredibly underrated character in Sanrio's roster, but an entire new significantly sized area for you to explore, filled with new critters, ingredients, and puzzles to solve. On top of that, Wheatflour Wonderland comes with its own story involving the friends you've made, in an adventure ripped straight from Sailor Moon which would make my pink-frilled, six-year-old self sing. There's a whole lot more here than I was expecting, which…",

Not only that, but it'll adjust its behaviour based on an AI-powered emotional spectrum, which Casio says allows it to \"express a diverse range of feelings.\" It can be grumpy, thrilled, joyful, anxious, lonely, calm, happy... in fact, it sounds like a right needy little git, and that's apparently part of the appeal.

After all, it's hard not to spread a little joy in the office, or at least to crack a smile yourself, when you're wearing cat ears. Pink is far from my favourite colour, as I tend to sport a more pro-purple agenda, but I'm not eager to kick out Razer's latest iteration of the Kraken Kitty headset. Available in both white and black colourways alongside the aforementioned 'quartz', the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro headset offers more than the novelty of feline flair. Costing $180/£180, it had better. As with every Kraken Kitty, the cat ears remain the crown jewel of this headset. To be clear, the charming interchangeable ears of the pricy V2 Pro are gone; we're now back to full-size animal ears rather than the V2 Pro's oddly diminutive accessories throwing off the proportions of what is an already bulky headset. The kitty ears here are sturdy, solidly anchored to the headband, and immediately eye-catching. With all of that hardware on top, you may think the V3 Pro would be fatiguing to wear.

There are detailed instructions on how to set it up on your Windows handheld on Reddit, thanks to user Gogsi123 (via The Verge ).

Multiplayer?: Up to 4-player co-op. Link: Official site This is not a series that innovates, and I don't think Gearbox has reinvented the wheel here, either. What the studio has done is make the perfect wheel, then presumably gone \"crap, we spent all our budget on wheel\" and put it on a clunky used car with steering that keeps locking up. I make this assumption because the game's most glaring issues are such blunders that I simply cannot fathom how they happened—they are legitimately baffling.

I first saw the Corsair Sabre V2 Pro at Gamescom, but I was told I couldn't speak about it until its launch today. Which, let me tell you, was a difficult ask, because it's thirty-six grams , for pity's sake. How can I keep quiet about a 36 g, non-holey, wireless gaming mouse that seemed—based on my few minutes using it back then—pretty comfortable? Somehow I kept it zipped, though, and I've now had some more time with the mouse. Not enough for a complete picture, mind, just a couple of hours dusting off the cobwebs in a Dust_2 deathmatch last night. And as I suspected, I am smitten, just like I was with the Logitech G Pro X Superlight when that launched. Back then, circa 2020–2021, the Superlight stunned me because it's a wireless mouse that managed to weigh in at just 63 g without the whole holey thing going on.

Oh, and Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel. Hold that thought. The announcement says the partnership will span both enterprise-class AI products and consumer PCs. It's the latter we're most interested in, of course, so here's what the statement has to say about that specifically: \"For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.\" And that really is it, barring some platitudes rolled out by Intel and Nvidia's CEOs, Lip Bu Tan and Jensen Huang respectively.

Already, we've found the reprised iconic Doom-inspired Hellwalker shotgun, the pleasantly-named Rainbow Vomit that covers all your elemental needs, and the Slippy , a fish grenade. Of all the 150-odd legendaries discovered so far, though, one has taken the cake as the most ridiculous: the Kickballer . When paired with a Jakobs licensed part and enhancement, you can get this shotgun to infinitely bounce projectiles around the room, nuking everything on the screen. More often than not, that also includes you, which can get pretty awkward as there's usually nothing left standing for you to kill to revive yourself. But what if I told you that there was another way? Some other shotgun that does brain-breaking damage that won't kill you in the process, and is somehow a random-ass purple item? Well, there is, it's the Quincunx Stellium , a Maliwan shotgun. As showcased by content creator Moxsy…",

This humble plant actually has multiple quests dedicated to it, including a special Act 2 ending you can achieve if you're willing to finish the game with the bud's restrictions active (and I'm not just talking about the screaming). If you'd rather not deal with the bud, you can also infect yourself and then have it removed, which will get you the Witch Crest. For all you Elden Ring fans out there, think of it a little like getting infected with the Flame of Frenzy—you can get a unique ending, or return to normal via a questline. Below, I'll explain where to find the Twisted Bud, how to use it, and then how to remove it once you immediately regret doing that so you can get the Witch Crest.

    "body": "Your average $5 wired mouse has no batteries. Alternatively, wireless gaming mice are dime a dozen. Well, almost. But what about a mouse with both no wires and no batteries? Say what? Oh, and while we're at it, how about ditching the optical sensor? That is the basic proposition offered by the Mirai Create Super EMR Mouse. Due to be unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show 2025 , it's a completely wireless mouse that uses EMR or electromagnetic resonance technology for both tracking and power. That allows wireless operation without the need for a battery or an optical sensor. Full specs haven't been released, but the basics involve a 1,000 Hz polling rate and a resolution of 0.01 mm. For now, the mouse's weight isn't quoted, but without batteries and the sensor, there's potential for ultra light weight. But how does it all work? There's a handy video on YouTube from an unrelated source to this Mirai Create mouse. But the video explains the technology neatly. EMR devices like this run on the same principles as Wacom's pen and digitiser pads. So, the power for the device actually comes from the pad, which contains an array of resonance circuits made up of a capacitor and an inductor coil. Wh…",

And it's not only a great time to dive into the OG ahead of the sequel's launch, it also has a seriously great discount as we speak. In celebration of five years since Hades launched into 1.0, Supergiant Games is putting on quite the party. There's a new \"In the Blood\" Anniversary mix for players to listen to, a big old sale over at Fangamer for official Hades merchandise, including pins, plushies, and t-shirts, and a huge discount on the game. \"If you've been putting off a trip to the Underworld, Hades is having its biggest sale ever,\" an official Steam blog post says . \"Why not dive in again, either for the first time or for old time's sake, and get set for Hades 2 next week; though, no prior experience is needed to enjoy the sequel!\" Hades is currently going for just $6.24/ £5.24, 75% off, a few quid cheaper than its previous lowest price. It's a ridiculously good price to get Hades for, and something that I would certainly recommend taking a look at. Despite my ungodly inability …",

Based on the reactions and vengeful affect of returning Dying Light 1 protagonist Kyle Crane, it seems the juice was bad. And yet it helps you kill zombies, so it might be good? Such are the fascinating moral complexities offered by zombie fiction. Perhaps the true beast… is humanity!?

If you're desperate to learn when you'll be able to go Beast mode in the latest Dying Light, don't fret: You won't have to endure years of zombie DNA experimentation.

In the original Hollow Knight, accessing Steel Soul Mode meant defeating the main game at least once. In Silksong the same is true, except there is also another easier and quicker way to unlock it too. But first, what is it? Steel Soul Mode is basically a permadeath mode for Silksong. When you die it's game over, and if you try to re-access the save file you'll be asked if you want to overwrite it. There's no going back, and as a result some items related to death have also changed in Steel Soul mode. For example: the Dead Bug's Purse, a tool which lets you retain half of your rosaries on death, becomes a Shell Satchel, which increases Hornet's tool pouch size. If Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode is any indication, there will also be some minor changes and additions in the adventure that will make the punishment worthwhile for completionists. How to unlock Steel Soul Mode in Silksong The most legitimate way of unlocking Steel Soul mode in Silksong is to simply complete the main game. But if you want to dive straight i…",

Did I immediately intuit, as someone well-versed in the sicko behavior of gaming speedrunners, that three hours was probably a really fast clear time for this indie game with its throwback 8-bit graphics that includes its own built-in randomizer? Of course not. \"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere near finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me. Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight—and the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.

Mists of Pandaria Remix had some hiccups early on, but Blizzard was quick to fix them and let players have their fun for the duration of the event. But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff. Blizzard quickly issued a response , saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing. Sure enough, the next PTR had a long list of changes that essentially removed all of the gear …",

There, they were met with the Rupture strain: new varieties of burrowing bug enemies that proved to be an immediate source of controversy by mercilessly kicking people's asses. Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts . While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons. Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for everyone else.

    "body": "Jack. It's one of pop culture's favorite names for heroes, tough guys, regular Joes (well, technically regular Jacks), and occasionally even villains. Characters named Jack are so common that Jeff Bridges and Kevin Bacon have each played characters named Jack seven times, Tom Cruise has been a Jack three times, and even Jack Nicholson—our most famous Jack—has been a Jack twice (Jack Torrance in The Shining and Jack Napier in Batman). Videogames have a long history of Jacks as well—it's just a good, solid, go-to name in a game. Got a character who can ride a horse or shoot a gun or punch someone real hard or is just, sort of, kind of, you know, typically a white guy? Consider naming them Jack. That's what our quiz is all about today. I'm going to show you a picture of a character from a game, and all you have to do is tell me is if it's a picture of Jack or not.

The DLC will see Basim, Mirage's protagonist, visiting AlUla, an ancient city key to Saudi Arabian culture. It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup. \"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site.

Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range—which looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set. Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree.

Well, Logitech has you covered; it'll just cost you $170. Will that be cash or card? Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t…",

The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation.

I've been playing the Borderlands series since its inception , but I have something terrible to confess—I have never, not once, been tempted to engage in the endgame. The closest I've ever got was when I rinsed through Borderlands 3's DLCs (many of which were shockingly good ), and even then, that was more coincidental. I'd simply run out of levels, so I was technically in the postgame. But I've never tried to get a build going, farm that all-important legendary, or so much as sneezed at a raid boss. I'm here to play 30 hours of a shooty RPG and then do something else. Borderlands 4 , though? Now I've chewed through the campaign, I'm severely tempted to get stuck back in.

I wouldn't blame you for being skeptical, but the result looks more promising than it sounds.

Teams enter the tower, gain abilities from memory-haunted weapons and equipment, and compete to climb higher before the current floor is destroyed until one team eventually stands triumphant at the tower's apex. At first glance, Arkheron's isometric perspective and hellish environs loudly ring a Diablo-esque bell.

Chris Hall, Senior Director Software Development and head of AMD's ROCm project, which is a software stack for AI development and roughly equivalent to Nvidia's CUDA platform, explained that FSR Redstone—which could be called FSR 5 when it hopefully releases later this year—was developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). Apparently, FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology is \"converted\" into compute Shader code. \"This means that FSR Redstone's neural rendering core can also run on GPUs made by other companies,\" Hall said (via machine translation). In other words, it doesn't require AI or matrix math cores, just as Nvidia's DLSS technology requires Tensor cores. It can run on conventional GPU shaders. \"ML2CODE-based frameworks, such as FSR Redstone, can be seamlessly integrated directly into DirectX or Vulkan graphics pipelines with minimal latency. We believe that the ML2CODE solution is the bes…",

The ban is said to specifically prevent certain Chinese companies from ordering and testing the RTX Pro 6000D, a product designed specifically for the Chinese market. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) handed out the ban to several companies, including TikTok owner ByteDance and Alibaba earlier this week, according to three of the FT's sources. Speaking to reporters in London on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that he expected to discuss the situation with US president Donald Trump during his state visit to the UK this week. \"We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,\" he said. \"I'm disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out between China and the US, and I'm understanding of that. We are patient about it.\" The ban looks to be the latest move in a long and sometimes-troubled relationship between Nvidia and China in regards to its AI GPU products, and comes mere weeks after the older H20 models were reportedly paused from production as a result of security…",

But US President Donald Trump is currently visiting our little island and already the cash is splashing, as Reuters reports that a $42 billion pact has been made. The 'Tech Prosperity Deal' reached between Trump and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer includes a bunch of things, such as joint AI healthcare model development and work on quantum computing and civil nuclear projects. The pact includes some specific deals by big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia. On the latter front, and certainly to the interest and envy of many a PC gamer, Nvidia has said it will deploy 120,000 GPUs across Britain, with up to 60,000 of these being Blackwell chips for Nscale . That AI supercomputer upgrade, in collaboration with OpenAI and Microsoft, will be the biggest in Britain.

With comfortable textured grips, a great feel, a sturdy build, and a classic look, it's still a bit of a banger five years after its Xbox Series X refresh. That refresh added a new share button, and it adds a lot for someone like me who clips arguably far too much from my games. However, when we got our hands on the GameSir G7 Pro , we knew it was special, and it has now been crowned the best PC controller by us here at PC Gamer. The G7 Pro absolutely deserves the pro name. The front plate, thumbsticks, and face buttons can be swapped out and replaced. The red model we tested came with three included D-pads, but only the one face plate. As well as coming with programmable paddle buttons at the bottom, the G7 Pro has two near the top bumper, and, most importantly, the thumbsticks are Hall effect, which means you can say goodbye to drift. Stick drift is pretty much the biggest downside of the Xbox controller, but that's not the only way this little GameSir wonder comes out on top. It's super solid and has lovely, clicky buttons. …",
