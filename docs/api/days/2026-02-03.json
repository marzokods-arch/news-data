I don't love it, and it's not what I'm looking for in an FPS these days, but I can't deny it's often fun. Overcomplicated? Yes. Artistically tacky? You bet. But Highguard's marquee Raid mode is genuinely unlike any other FPS mode out there, at least in the sense that nobody has ever constructed this particular FPS sandwich before: Two slices of Rainbow Six with a battle royale center. I also appreciate that it's a free-to-play shooter that doesn't bombard players with ads (at least for now) or sell battle passes that expire. It's doing the regular live service things as right as you can without simply not doing them, which honestly, would be preferable. Highguard's bigger problems—at least, the ones it can still control —come from the consequences of its strange mixture. With huge map…",

That's a tricky thing to navigate when determining value here, as nothing is as good value as it was five months ago, but I have generally little bad to say about the Element Pro. It's solid. Starting with its choice of components, it comes with an Asus Prime RX 9070 XT 16 GB, which isn't far off the choice of graphics card I'd choose for a PC build of my own right now. It's capable at 4K and has 16 GB of VRAM. That alone is sure to make some gamers swoon. Though you don't get to switch on DLSS, FSR is a decent alternative. And the Prime card, including a triple-fan shroud, is pretty cool and quiet—reaching a mere 61 °C in my testing in Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition. The CPU is the tremendous Ryzen 7 7800X3D , which was once upon a time the best CPU for gaming . That title has swapped hands to the one-generation newer Ryzen 7 9800X3D now, though the 7800X3D isn't hugely far behind. Thanks in part to both chips using 3D V-Cache. It's an eight-core, 16…",

I did a lot of the character systems and one of Todd's philosophies early on in Oblivion, which I took to heart and why I pushed so hard for these things, is that he wanted an interfaceless game so ideally you just play the game.

It experimented with a 5v5 raid mode over the weekend , but maintained that it wasn't meant to be a replacement for its standard 3v3 mode.

I got to speak to design director Maria Hamilton recently, who said she's been wowed by the tools themselves: \"I think the first thing that I said on seeing where they were really early on was 'Oh my god, I want those tools', because they are vastly better than what many designers are using for building out areas.\" She clarifies that she means non-specialised designers, noting that \"If you're a worldbuilder, if that's your job, then you have really excellent mastery of very good complex tools. But the rest of us who are not artists are struggling the same way players would be.\" So intuitive, in fact, that she feels like they'd make good questing material: \"The tools that have been put together here are so intuitive and so easy to use, we really want to use them.

One thing that has bothered me, however, is the limit to two houses per account—one per faction.

Ars Technica's reporting focusses, inevitably, on TVs. But where TVs go, the PC monitor market often follows. See 1080p and 4K resolutions for proof. Of course, TV and monitor formats and resolutions are not all exactly the same. See 1440p and ultrawide monitors for proof, equally, of that. Ars points out that the first 8K TV was announced by Sharp way back in 2012, with the first 8K OLED being released by LG in 2019. But wider adoption has been slow. While there are now, by the estimates of data firm Omdia, around one billion 4K TVs out there, only 1.6 million 8K TVs have found homes since 2015. Indeed, what little 8K TV sales there have been peaked in 2022. Consequently, the likes of LG and Sony are entirely exiting the 8K market .

Featuring a beamforming microphone, the G325 ditches the usual boom arm we're used to seeing on gaming headsets. It uses a microphone built into the earcup that's taking aim at your mouth, and using AI-powered denoising to keep non-mouth sounds away from the feed. I've experimented with beamforming microphones before. Both on the Bang & Olufsen Portal and Audeze Maxwell —with the former being my go-to headphones for a long while now. Admittedly, the beamforming microphone on both is weaker than your average boom arm, and by some margin, but perhaps noise cancelling will come to the rescue here. I'm yet to try out the Logitech headset myself, but Logitech employees using the headset sounded clear enough in a pre-briefing call in a quiet space. But hey, we can put it to the test soon ourselves. The G325 are wireless cans, with both Logitech's 2.4 GHz tech, Lightspeed Wireless, and Bluetooth 5.2. They also support 24-bit audio, though no word on the exact drivers used here to make the most of it. Logitech G32…",

Then yesterday, Reuters posted a story detailing the reported dissatisfaction of OpenAI with Nvidia's GPUs, specifically for the task of inferencing AI models. If the latter story looks a lot like somebody at OpenAI hitting back at the original Wall Street Journal claims, the two narratives combined feel like just the sort of tit-for-tat off-the-record briefing that occurs when an alliance is beginning to falter. For now, none of this is official. It's all rumour. However, it is true that Nvidia's intention to invest $100 billion in OpenAI was announced in September and has yet to be finalised.

That's why I was a little surprised to see competitive players as the target audience for Be Quiet!'s first foray into the gaming peripherals market. Unlike the Be Quiet! Light Mount and its wonderful dampened keys, the Dark Perk Ergo and Dark Perk Sym don't have noticeable gimmicks—they miss a USP. I can, however, say that the Dark Perk Ergo is clearly very well built. Despite holes in the bottom to cut down on weight, it's not flimsy. I can apply a lot of pressure on the side (be it for fun or because I've lost a round), and it doesn't move an inch. At 55 g, it's certainly on the lighter side, but Be Quiet!'s material choice is a good one, giving a mouse that could take a drop or jostle without a problem.

We really need a monthly limit on MMO and RPG releases or something—emphasis on the limit if you're combining the two. But until then there's more than enough to hold you over, including the brutally honest survival game Unemployment Simulator 2018 , and Edmund McMillen's turn-based adventures about selectively screwed up cats, Mewgenics. He thinks it's his best game yet, and Tyler may agree with him . As for myself, I'm kind of in a weird, creepy, cozy marathon until next month rolls in. I've been enjoying the adorably spooky lo-fi puzzles in Creature Kitchen's demo , and riding a man-eating elevator to hell in the co-op nightmare that is Kletka.

With the benefit of hindsight I know that two things worked in Valheim's favour. One was its clever finetuning of survival and building systems that still felt really clunky in competing games, and which many have since adopted. The other thing was Vikings. Valheim ruled so much that it was our favourite game of 2021 , and that was largely thanks to Vikings. Five years later Valheim is still in early access, but its updates come thick and fast and its community seems, by and large, pretty happy with how things are going. To celebrate the milestone, Iron Gate has issued a special anniversary update, or \"Patch 0.221.10\" in more prosaic terms. It features a bunch of nice things, like \"a celebratory hat\", a new weapon in the form of early axes (they're basically ancient dual-wieldable axes), and frosted sweetbread, which is a new consumable.

Rose in picture, rose in name of game. Who could fault this theory? Alas, as cool as a remake of Rule of Rose would be, that's not what the teaser is teasing. Bloober Team CEO has confirmed as much on LinkedIn . \"Nice guess, but no,\" Piotr Babieno posted in response to an article by Twisted Voxel. \"It definitely doesn't refer to any remake.\" The teaser appeared at the URL remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com . In addition to the suspicious rose there's also the text \"some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait\", as well as a counter counting down to 11 days from now: on February 15.

The animations for Mewgenics , the latest game from important Flash game designers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, were made in Adobe Animate.

    "body": "Alone in the Dark was the first 3D survival horror game, beating Resident Evil to the punch by four years. Its polygonal character models in dingy pre-rendered interiors looked genuinely frightening in 1992 and, to be honest, still looks kinda creepy in 2026, albeit less for its realism and more for its antiquated art style. I'd highly recommend you play them, or at least, play a little bit of them: they're pretty hard going by modern standards. Now's a better time than ever to become acquainted with this slice of PC gaming history: GOG is giving away the original Alone in the Dark trilogy right now. It's actually more than the original trilogy too, because it includes Jack in the Dark, a weird spin-off released between Alone in the Dark and its sequel about a kid stuck in a creepy toy store. While Alone in the Dark has many of the hallmarks of early survival horror, including tank controls, fixed camera perspectives, and near-unmanagable combat, newcomers may be surprised how much it borrows from point 'n' click adventures. Puzzle-solving continues to be a fixture in survival horror, but Alone in the Dark adopts the age-old \"apply correct object to correct surface\" gameplay, albe…",

I imagine we'll probably get at least one of those remasters in the future: the same leak that was right about the Oblivion remaster also said a Fallout 3 remaster was in the works. So I guess the real question is: when? Naturally, fans are hoping it'll be sooner and not later—many even hope a remaster will be announced alongside the Fallout Season 2 finale this week—and Bethesda is doing its part to keep that hopium flowing. A new ad promoting Bethesda's Fallout games was posted today, and some fans claim it not-so-subtly suggests that a Fallout 3 remaster announcement is imminent. That's because the ad shows Aaron Moten, who plays Maximus on the Fallout TV series, inside Fallout 3. Hmm… In the ad, Moten is roommates with a giant Vault Boy mascot.

It's fair to say that we at PC Gamer have never been the biggest fans of the Steam Controller, either. We got the chance to try it at GDC in 2014 , where we said, \"I would've absolutely had more fun and been more effective with an Xbox 360 controller.\" We then got to test it for its official launch the following year and were, again, not that impressed . We also weren't that into the idea of a second one back in 2022, though we did admit the Steam Deck owes its great controls to the controller.

In an interview with PressBoxPR , however, former Bethesda veteran and Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith has defended the studio's continued use of the engine, pointing to the huge disruption that would be caused by a changeover. \"It is a massive effort. You are talking about dozens of people spent doing nothing but making an engine work,\" says Nesmith. \"You are talking about putting your developers into a situation where they can't play the game. They may not even be able to work on making the game for long stretches because the engine is not there or up to snuff yet.\" He doesn't quite go as far as praising it, but he does seem to have faith in it as a platform that can continue to be modified and improved as needed. \"The Creation Engine has been tweaked to serve Bethesd…",

One distro that is noticeably absent from the Open Gaming Collective (OCG) collaboration, though, is CachyOS, and Peter Jung, founder and developer of CachyOS, has explained why (via GamingOnLinux ). Replying to someone on Reddit, Jung, AKA ptr1337, explains : \"We have thought about this but we opted out, since we do not see all too much benefit from our side. Handheld stuff is not our major focus. Also, we had some concerns that this could become a 'bureaucratic loophole', which seems to be more or less true so far. \"Additionally, to us all this 'initiative' looked like an emergency rushed thing, so that Bazzite finds new kernel maintainers and for other technical stuff after kicking the maintainer, which basically made most integration work for them.\" The dev also expressed that the company doesn't want to be associated with Playtron, another somewhat controversial distro that's part of the OGC. Apparently, \"there are more reasons, but I'll keep them out of the public.\" The idea behind the OGC seems to be twofold: first, to ensure different…",

Puget Systems also gives a shoutout to AMD's Ryzen X3D processors as having a better track record than its regular 9000-series chips, with a 1.51% failure rate, while Nvidia's Founders Edition GPUs are said to be the most reliable GeForce RTX cards sold by the company in 2025, with a mere 0.25% failure rate overall. The top processor may seem like a surprising pick, as it wasn't long ago that Intel was in the headlines for a host of CPU-crashing issues plaguing its older models. However, the Arrow Lake generation (along with microcode updates for 13th and 14th generation chips) appears to have steadied the ship considerably, and the 20-core Core Ultra 7 265K is something of a favourite around these parts, too.

The site says, \"humans welcome to observe.\" And so I have been, clicking through the various threads to find out what it is that AI agents 'talk' about to each other about.

Well, far from resting on their laurels, the team has since taken their efforts one step further (via Videocardz ). Thanks to the addition of an Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti PCB as its base and some clever power tweaking, the GPU-with-a-hole has managed to set a world record: the top spot in Unigine Superposition's online rankings for an RTX 5070 Ti, running the 8K optimized preset. Over the course of a seven-hour+ live stream , the team fought against a litany of issues to convince the Frank-o-card to perform properly, including an early problem with low-resolution-only output and voltage drops under load. A rat's nest of wires, the judicious use of yellow tape, and the odd cutting tool were used to reduce conductor resistance and voltage loss between the two cards—although it still seems to have the odd quirk worth looking into.
