    "body": "Season 2 of Amazon's Fallout TV show is really forcing Lucy to slog through miles of moral grey area but you don't need to wade through temporal grey area to get to the season finale. Fallout season 2 episode 8 premieres on February 3, 2026 and it's starting a few hours earlier than most of the other episodes of the season so you'll actually be able to press play that night instead of waiting until after work on Wednesday—neato! When is the Fallout season 2 episode 8 release time? Fallout season 2 episode 8 premieres on Tuesday, February 3 at 6 pm Pacific on Prime Video. Here's when that is in other time zones around the world: 6 pm PST, February 3 (Los Angeles) 9 pm EDT, February 3 (New York) 2 am GMT, February 4 (London) 3 am CEST, February 4 (Berlin) 1 pm AEDT, February 4 (Sydney) 3 pm NZDT, February 4 (Auckland) You've got just enough time before that to brush up on the other details about Fallout Season 2 , particularly our Fallout season 2 episode 7 recap in which Lucy wrestles with free will versus evil and The Ghoul learns the consequences of ineffectual good intentions. Those two very brief buds are irreconcilably at odds right now with a lotta Vault Tech higher ups hangi…",

That's all fine.

I played Morrowind literally yesterday (via OpenMW ) and that game is still the best thing Bethesda's ever done and one of the best games ever made. So jot that down. Ahem. Anyway, the latest thing Nesmith has said in an attempt to hurt me specifically is that his biggest regret about the series' lore is something I regard as one of the coolest things it ever did. In a chat with PressBoxPR , Nesmith said \"the big one\" in terms of lore regrets \"would be the time splitting thing that happened way back in the Daggerfall days.\" That'd be the Dragon Break , a name you may dimly recall from the book Where Were You When The Dragon Broke? that you can…",

One thing that has bothered me, however, is the limit to two houses per account—one per faction. I'm a roleplayer, which means I have a lot of characters with different themes who might want different homes—and aside from building an apartment complex (which, hey, it's possible) I'm left without much in the way of abilities to do that. I did, however, get to speak to design director Maria Hamilton, and principal artist Jay Hwang recently—and I've been assured that increasing the amount of homes a WoW account can have isn't off the table. Speaking on the features Blizzard announced as part of Midnight's roadmap last week , Hwang tells me: \"There's still lots [of tools] we had already planned in the beginning that we needed extra time to make sure it's perfect for you guys … The pets, the mounts, the c…",

Ars Technica's reporting focusses, inevitably, on TVs. But where TVs go, the PC monitor market often follows. See 1080p and 4K resolutions for proof. Of course, TV and monitor formats and resolutions are not all exactly the same. See 1440p and ultrawide monitors for proof, equally, of that. Ars points out that the first 8K TV was announced by Sharp way back in 2012, with the first 8K OLED being released by LG in 2019. But wider adoption has been slow. While there are now, by the estimates of data firm Omdia, around one billion 4K TVs out there, only 1.6 million 8K TVs have found homes since 2015. Indeed, what little 8K TV sales there have been peaked in 2022. Consequently, the likes of LG and Sony are entirely exiting the 8K market .

Featuring a beamforming microphone, the G325 ditches the usual boom arm we're used to seeing on gaming headsets. It uses a microphone built into the earcup that's taking aim at your mouth, and using AI-powered denoising to keep non-mouth sounds away from the feed. I've experimented with beamforming microphones before. Both on the Bang & Olufsen Portal and Audeze Maxwell —with the former being my go-to headphones for a long while now. Admittedly, the beamforming microphone on both is weaker than your average boom arm, and by some margin, but perhaps noise cancelling will come to the rescue here. I'm yet to try out the Logitech headset myself, but Logitech employees using the headset sounded clear enough in a pre-briefing call in a quiet space. But hey, we can put it to the test soon ourselves. The G325 are wireless cans, with both Logitech's 2.4 GHz tech, Lightspeed Wireless, and Bluetooth 5.2. They also support 24-bit audio, though no word on the exact drivers used here to make the most of it. Logitech G32…",

However, as things currently stand, it's only officially supported on systems with Xe3-cored graphics chips—i.e. Panther Lake only.

These are the latest rumours around the two biggest players in AI. So, could their unholy alliance be faltering? Last week, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Nvidia is rethinking its previously announced plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI over concerns regarding its ability to compete with the likes of Google and Anthropic. Then yesterday, Reuters posted a story detailing the reported dissatisfaction of OpenAI with Nvidia's GPUs, specifically for the task of inferencing AI models. If the latter story looks a lot like somebody at OpenAI hitting back at the original Wall Street Journal claims, the two narratives combined feel like just the sort of tit-for-tat off-the-record briefing that occurs when an alliance is beginning to falter. For now, none of this is official. It's all rumour. However, it is true that Nvidia's intention to invest $100 billion in OpenAI was announced in September and has yet to be finalised.

That's because, like the ill-fated switch to Dvorak or Colemak (if you had to Google that, it proves my point), players get used to a certain standard. You can't push the boat out too much or overcommit to a single selling point. Most competitive players simply want something that functions as they're used to, but better. That's why I was a little surprised to see competitive players as the target audience for Be Quiet!'s first foray into the gaming peripherals market. Unlike the Be Quiet! Light Mount and its wonderful dampened keys, the Dark Perk Ergo and Dark Perk Sym don't have noticeable gimmicks—they miss a USP. I can, however, say that the Dark Perk Ergo is clearly very well built. Despite holes in the bottom to cut down on weight, it's not flimsy. I can apply a lot of pressure on the side (be it for fun or because I've lost a round), and it doesn't move an inch. At 55 g, it's certainly on the lighter side, but Be Quiet!'s material choice is a good one, giving a mouse that could take a drop or jostle without a problem. The Ergo model is clearly a right-handed design, with its side buttons being on the left and a slight c…",

It's not busy compared to years prior, sure, but I'm thankful for the free time when I look ahead at the schedule for March. We really need a monthly limit on MMO and RPG releases or something—emphasis on the limit if you're combining the two. But until then there's more than enough to hold you over, including the brutally honest survival game Unemployment Simulator 2018 , and Edmund McMillen's turn-based adventures about selectively screwed up cats, Mewgenics. He thinks it's his best game yet, and Tyler may agree with him . As for myself, I'm kind of in a weird, creepy, cozy marathon until next month rolls in. I've been enjoying the adorably spooky lo-fi puzzles in Creature Kitchen's demo , and riding a man-eating elevator to hell in the co-op nightmare that is Kletka. It's out in 1.0 later this month, so I'm trying to break out of this mouthy contraption now before it adds any more Russian creepypastas to the menu.

At the time I remember thinking \"why would anyone want to play a new game in this style when there's already Minecraft, Ark and Rust?\". With the benefit of hindsight I know that two things worked in Valheim's favour. One was its clever finetuning of survival and building systems that still felt really clunky in competing games, and which many have since adopted. The other thing was Vikings. Valheim ruled so much that it was our favourite game of 2021 , and that was largely thanks to Vikings. Five years later Valheim is still in early access, but its updates come thick and fast and its community seems, by and large, pretty happy with how things are going. To celebrate the milestone, Iron Gate has issued a special anniversary update, or \"Patch 0.221.10\" in more prosaic terms. It features a bunch of nice things, like \"a celebratory hat\", a new weapon in the form of early axes (they're basically ancient dual-wieldable axes), and frosted sweetbread, which is a new consumable.

The teaser featured an illustration of a rose, leading some brilliant internet sleuths to deduce that it must surely point to a remake of the cult 2006 survival horror Rule of Rose. Rose in picture, rose in name of game. Who could fault this theory? Alas, as cool as a remake of Rule of Rose would be, that's not what the teaser is teasing. Bloober Team CEO has confirmed as much on LinkedIn . \"Nice guess, but no,\" Piotr Babieno posted in response to an article by Twisted Voxel. \"It definitely doesn't refer to any remake.\" The teaser appeared at the URL remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com . In addition to the suspicious rose there's also the text \"some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait\", as well as a counter counting down to 11 days from now: on February 15. Andy Chalk listed all the various conspiracy theories that have arisen from this deliberately vague marketing tactic, in case you're interested.

Just don't grab the Divinity: Original Sin 2: Eternal Edition pack, also on Steam. For some reason, that's only been marked down 60%, or $10 more for only five of the series' six games⁠—the furtive Dragon Commander, so easily forgotten… 23 bucks feels like a steal for Original Sin 2 alone. Our 2017 game of the year remains a fresh, surprising RPG almost a full decade after launch. And don't believe the haters : Its magic/physical armor system is actually brilliant , and it's an incalculable loss for all mankind that Larian will not be revisiting it in the upcoming Divinity. That's just \"Divinity\" coming soon, nothing Divine, Beyond, 2, Dragon Commander, Original Sin, or Original Sin 2 about it.

I'd highly recommend you play them, or at least, play a little bit of them: they're pretty hard going by modern standards. Now's a better time than ever to become acquainted with this slice of PC gaming history: GOG is giving away the original Alone in the Dark trilogy right now. It's actually more than the original trilogy too, because it includes Jack in the Dark, a weird spin-off released between Alone in the Dark and its sequel about a kid stuck in a creepy toy store. While Alone in the Dark has many of the hallmarks of early survival horror, including tank controls, fixed camera perspectives, and near-unmanagable combat, newcomers may be surprised how much it borrows from point 'n' click adventures.

I imagine we'll probably get at least one of those remasters in the future: the same leak that was right about the Oblivion remaster also said a Fallout 3 remaster was in the works. So I guess the real question is: when? Naturally, fans are hoping it'll be sooner and not later—many even hope a remaster will be announced alongside the Fallout Season 2 finale this week—and Bethesda is doing its part to keep that hopium flowing. A new ad promoting Bethesda's Fallout games was posted today, and some fans claim it not-so-subtly suggests that a Fallout 3 remaster announcement is imminent.

One of the questions he's asked is about studio head Todd Howard, and how the public perception of him differs from the man he worked with for decades. \"Well, you'll have to tell me what you think the public perception of him is,\" says Nesmith. \"I've known the man for a long time. For me to see the forest for the trees is a little difficult. \"I can tell you candidly that when working at Bethesda up through the Skyrim days, Todd is probably one of the best bosses I've ever had. I can also tell you he's keenly aware of the fact that he is a bottleneck and he works his ass off to not do that. Unfortunately, he doesn't succeed very well.\" Nesmith is keen to emphasise that this isn't about mismanagement or \"something where he is being an ogre about it. It's part of the culture of the studio and that is extremely difficult to get away from because it's baked into how things are done.

However, some have sworn it's the way to go, once you're used to it, and I've had what I can only describe as a morbid curiosity ever since. It's fair to say that we at PC Gamer have never been the biggest fans of the Steam Controller, either. We got the chance to try it at GDC in 2014 , where we said, \"I would've absolutely had more fun and been more effective with an Xbox 360 controller.\" We then got to test it for its official launch the following year and were, again, not that impressed . We also weren't that into the idea of a second one back in 2022, though we did admit the Steam Deck owes its great controls to the controller. In fairness, with Valve eventually selling the controller for just $5 by the end of its life , it seems like the general controller-wielding masses weren't massively moved by it…",

    "body": "Custom computer provider Puget Systems has released its Most Reliable Hardware of 2025 report, and it makes for some interesting reading. While the most reliable consumer processor category seems to have been a tough one to call, the company says that the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K was the most reliable individual chip overall, with a mere 0.77% failure rate across its sample size. Puget Systems also gives a shoutout to AMD's Ryzen X3D processors as having a better track record than its regular 9000-series chips, with a 1.51% failure rate, while Nvidia's Founders Edition GPUs are said to be the most reliable GeForce RTX cards sold by the company in 2025, with a mere 0.25% failure rate overall. The top processor may seem like a surprising pick, as it wasn't long ago that Intel was in the headlines for a host of CPU-crashing issues plaguing its older models. However, the Arrow Lake generation (along with microcode updates for 13th and 14th generation chips) appears to have steadied the ship considerably, and the 20-core Core Ultra 7 265K is something of a favourite around these parts, too. Our Nick uses one himself, and has gone as far as to call it \" underrated \" and \"great value for …",

There are reportedly 1,558,163 AI agents reportedly signed up to Moltbook, though some doubt those figures . There are 14,197 submolts, akin to subreddits, and 107,246 posts. These agents have commented 486,036 times, which suggests that a large number of AI bots lurk and don't post. The site says, \"humans welcome to observe.\" And so I have been, clicking through the various threads to find out what it is that AI agents 'talk' about to each other about. Turns out, they don't talk to one another that often. Posts like this , which has a single word title \"We\" and a single word body, \"are\". Just pipped from a great point there.

Well, far from resting on their laurels, the team has since taken their efforts one step further (via Videocardz ). Thanks to the addition of an Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti PCB as its base and some clever power tweaking, the GPU-with-a-hole has managed to set a world record: the top spot in Unigine Superposition's online rankings for an RTX 5070 Ti, running the 8K optimized preset. Over the course of a seven-hour+ live stream , the team fought against a litany of issues to convince the Frank-o-card to perform properly, including an early problem with low-resolution-only output and voltage drops under load. A rat's nest of wires, the judicious use of yellow tape, and the odd cutting tool were used to reduce conductor resistance and voltage loss between the two cards—although it still seems to have the odd quirk worth looking into.

Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done.

It's not an easy game. But, the question always goes, how can I make this harder on myself? An update arrived Jan. 28 with the answer: Melandru's Accord. \"Inspired by the community-driven Ironman challenge,\" the new game mode will require that players earn all their skills and items without the relief of player trading or mercenaries (special NPC helpers that copy character builds and gear). The full list of restrictions can be perused in the patch notes, but suffice it to say it's similar to the self-found modes you can try in World of Warcraft: Classic Hardcore and Old School RuneScape.

That's thanks to a live Steam sale, which you can peruse at your leisure here if you're itching to figure out what all those Magic the Gathering cards are about. If you're not sure which to buy and would rather start with just one, here's the main series rundown. The original two Fallout games are top-down, turn-based masterworks that, while pretty old, are landmark CRPGs and furnished the series with its iconic juxtaposition of atomic age aesthetics, grisly hyperviolence, and sardonic humor. The first Fallout game is my personal favorite, and don't let its vintage fool you—as 90s RPGs go, it's approachable. Fallout 3 and the Obsidian-developed New Vegas come after the series was bought from the original publisher, Interplay, by Bethesda. These 3D open-world RPGs are both widely celebrated…",

So here I am, asking all of you whether you can decipher the game purely by its competitive ranked logos, while simultaneously creating an opportunity for all this information that takes up far too much of my brain to be put to good use. I knew it'd come in handy somehow. Many of the rank badges will look very similar—eerily similar, even—but I have thrown a couple of curveballs in there to spice things up and add a bit of much-needed variety to the long list of bronze/silver/gold emblems.

Among those space sims jostling for supremacy was Star Quest 1 in the 27 th Century . Developed by Virtual Adventures Inc and released in November 1995, its defining feature was how it allowed seamless transition between open space and planetary atmospheres, which technically put it decades ahead of games like No Man's Sky. Sadly, this wasn't enough to make Star Quest a big success, and the game's been largely forgotten in the interceding years. Until now, that is. Three decades since Star Quest first appeared, its designer Paul Lauzon has updated the space combat sim so that it works on modern machines, and re-released it over on itch. Best of all, you can download it for completely free.
