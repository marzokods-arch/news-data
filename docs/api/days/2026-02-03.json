The Galaxy S22 series has moved from monthly to quarterly security updates as the end of its support life draws closer. Samsung’s typical seven-year update promise only arrived with the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S phones now come with seven years of software support as standard, but that promise only kicked in with the Galaxy S24 series. Older flagships are still bound by the update policies in place when they launched, and for the Galaxy S21 lineup, it looks like the end has arrived. According to the latest security update listings published on SamsungMobile.com (via SamMobile ), the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra no longer appear on any of the company’s monthly or quarterly update schedules. That’s a clear indication that these phones are no longer set to receive regular OS updates or security patches. As usual, an update could still arrive if a critical vulnerability demands it, but routine updates appear to be over.",

By pushing more intelligence onboard, missions can move from passively collecting data to actively interpreting and responding to changing surface conditions in near-real time, enabling more targeted observations and dramatically improving the value of data returned to the ground. Within this context, land-focused applications such as regenerative agriculture, sustainable forestry, and broader land resilience efforts stand to benefit enormously from satellites that can adapt what, when, and how they sense based on dynamic environmental signals and algorithmic insight rather than fixed schedules or static acquisition plans. NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) invites participants to design small satellite (SmallSat) mission concepts that leverage adaptive sensing and onboard processing to enhance regenerative agriculture, forestry, or a similar land resilience objective.​ Participants must work within onboard power, compute, and bandwidth constraints characteristic of SmallSat missions, focusing on how to orchestrate exist…",

Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

This would be the first time that Samsung plans to produce more Folds than Flips from the outset. This comes after the Galaxy Z Fold 7 reportedly outsold the Galaxy Z Flip 8 last year, despite Samsung originally planning to make more Flips. Samsung traditionally produces more Flip phones than Fold devices in a given year, as Flip foldables are significantly cheaper and tend to see more demand. However, it sounds like Samsung is planning to flip (heh) the script in 2026. Korean outlet ET News reports that Samsung plans to produce more Galaxy Z Fold 8 units than Galaxy Z Flip 8 devices this year. The website, citing industry sources, says Samsung will make 3.5 million Galaxy Z Fold 8 devices in 2026 versus 2.5 to 3 million Z Flip 8 units.",

The earbuds are likely to feature a practical, stable design to avoid the Galaxy Buds 3’s quality issues. The Buds 4 series might also cost the same as the Buds 3 did at launch. Unlike its smartphones, Samsung refreshes its flagship earbuds once every two years. That means the successor to the Galaxy Buds 3 series should launch sometime this year. While Samsung typically launches earbuds alongside its foldables at mid-year, it may release the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro earlier than usual, alongside the Galaxy S26 series later this month. And, the chief focus for these flagship earbuds would be reliability. According to industry sources cited by Korea’s ET News , Samsung’s efforts with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 series aim to regain consumer trust. The Galaxy Buds 3’s launch was marred by widespread reliability issues, including poor build quality, visible gaps in the earbuds, and fragile earbuds that ripped easily ( here are some more specific ones ).

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a Gemini-powered upgrade for the “Suggest an edit” feature in Google Maps. The new interface replaces the standard form-like experience with a chatbot-style experience that accepts natural language. Suggested edits are still submitted for Google’s review before going live. Google has been in overdrive, trying to integrate Gemini and its AI capabilities into all its apps and services. Google Maps has also received its fair share, including the recent Gemini-powered upgrade to walking and cycling navigation . But there’s more coming, as we’ve now spotted Gemini being added to Google Maps’ community edit process.

    "body": "Despite their controversial aesthetic, the Nothing Headphones (1) have many handy features under the hood. Credit: Tom Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR The Nothing Headphone (a) is reportedly launching on March 12, with pre-orders starting around March 5. It is rumored to cost €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is roughly half of the Headphone 1. The leak suggests four color options: black, white, pink, and yellow. Nothing is reportedly about to break the premium-only mold it set with the Headphone 1 . After turning heads with its transparent-design over-ears and solid feature set last year, the brand is now said to be readying a more affordable sibling, and the pricing could surprise you. A new report from Dealabs says the launch is set for March 12, 2026, with pre-orders starting around March 5 (via Notebookcheck ). The big news is the expected price: about €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is about half of what the original Headphone 1 cost at launch. This price drop puts Nothing in direct competition with mid-range headphones from brands like JBL and Sony, which is unexpected for a company known for its premium look and pricing.",

Notably, two rumored colors, Pink Gold and Silver Shadow, are missing from the collection. We’re unsure if that implies these colors have been dropped or will be available in limited quantities. We’re heading closer to the official Galaxy S26 series unveiling later this month. It would be interesting to note how Samsung keeps us engaged during the Unpacked event, especially since most information about the phones has already leaked. And new leaks just don’t stop coming. While the overall designs of the new Galaxy S26 phones have broken cover multiple times, leaks around other tidbits are gaining momentum. And today, we’re looking at the Galaxy S26 Ultra in the different color options. The leak comes from Russian retailer Cifrus.ru , which appears to have listed the Galaxy S26 Ultra in different colors. Although the listings have since been removed, SammyGuru obtained images of Galaxy S26 Ultra renders in various colors.",

ESPN’s daily revenue loss was over $7 million per day, totaling a loss of over $110 million in operational revenue. Last year, in October, Google announced it was in negotiations with Disney to keep networks like ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV. As the two parties failed to reach an agreement before the then-existing licensing deal expired, a Disney media blackout ensued. Although both corporations were predicted to lose millions during the blackout, the situation wasn’t resolved until mid-November .

In a new Google Home changelog today , the company says it has improved “close-to-live playback” for cameras in the Google Home app. That means the app should now be much better at playing back clips that were recorded moments ago, reducing those all-too-familiar “Video not available” errors when you tap a notification or open a recent event.",

Nearby Ring cameras can automatically flag dogs that resemble a missing pet and alert users, who can choose whether to share footage with the dog’s owners. The AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog per day since it launched. Losing your dog is often a panic-inducing event, and you immediately want everyone in the neighbourhood on the lookout. While most of your neighbours would probably like to help, they’re busy with their own lives. Ring is now leaning into that reality by opening up its Search Party for Dogs feature to everyone, whether they own a Ring security camera or not. According to an announcement from the Amazon Newsroom , the AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog a day with their owners since its launch, but it was previously limited to Ring camera owners. With this expansion, anyone can now post a missing dog alert through the app and have nearby Ring cameras hunt for it, even if they don’t have any of the brand’s hardware themselves.",

Initially advertised to ship with a 6,000mAh battery, the Pocket S Mini went into urgent production in order to ship before the Chinese New Year, which kicks off next week.

A surprising report last month claimed that OnePlus may be winding down its smartphone operation, and we polled you on your feelings about it in our coverage. OnePlus has since dismissed the report as false, so it might be nothing, but my colleague Joe Maring argued that losing OnePlus would be bad for Android and the US smartphone industry as a whole.

However, it says, “new theme packs are coming.” Google has also dropped more hints about upcoming AI-based icon theming, which could arrive soon but would require Android 17 to work.

Google is therefore continuing to drop new features in Gemini to entice users, and is now testing three new features.

Out of the features Google is currently testing in Gemini, the most compelling appears to be the ability to import chats from other AI chatbots while retaining all information and media shared in those chats. Alexey Shabanov of TestingCatalog has discovered a new “Import AI Chats” option in Gemini’s attachment menu.

I decided she needed a replacement, but we agreed it didn’t necessarily need to be a top-tier flagship. We settled on the Galaxy S25 FE (), which I was able to get for under $500. From the moment we set it up, I noticed how familiar this phone felt to my own Galaxy S24, inside and out. After setting it up, I didn’t dwell on it much until about a week or two later, when I asked my daughter if she was okay with the phone still.

The premium 4.2-inch, 4:3 handheld has a powerful G3x Gen 2 SoC and starts at $319 for the month of February, with a free gift pack. AYANEO has done the unthinkable. The company that has been the target of so many shipping complaints over the years just shadowdropped its latest Pocket S Mini handheld, skipping crowdfunding and pre-order periods altogether. Ok, so it’s not quite a complete shadowdrop, since the company has teased the Pocket S Mini since September , but now we finally have full specs and pricing. As the name implies, it has the same premium design language as the Pocket S, with an all-metal CNC frame and an all-glass front. The 4.2-inch 4:3 LCD panel appears to be the same one as the budget Pocket Air Mini (though the company promises it’s been improved), and it’s the ideal resolution for retro games.",

It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools.

We know we need to get things done, but for one reason or another, we keep putting them off and off… and off and off. Google seems to be feeling a little sympathy for those of us who struggle along these lines, as the company has just pushed back a significant deadline for Fitbit users.

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Log files from the Galaxy S26 Ultra suggest Samsung may finally support Android’s Linux Terminal feature after skipping it on the S25 Ultra. The logs show support for the Android Virtualization Framework, a key requirement that was missing on Samsung’s last flagship. With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android. The tool lets Android run a full Linux environment directly on the device, but Samsung’s own flagships were left out. Despite having the right hardware on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra didn’t support it. However, we’ve spotted signs that this may finally change with the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

If you were holding on to hope that these challengers would convince Oura to drop its subscription model to remain competitive, it looks like you were barking up the wrong tree.

While NVIDIA still isn’t ready to publicly commit to a new Shield TV, the company has started sharing a little about what a hypothetical new box might change. One big focus could be better hardware support for modern codecs. There are maybe three kinds of Android TV users out there. We’ve got our Google fans, who will go with a device like the Google TV Streamer largely because — much like Pixel users with their phones — they want first look at all of Google’s latest features. Then we’ve got the budget crowd who just wants to find the most affordable streaming solution around. But then, there are the power users. They want hardware with versatile ports, the performance to game on their TVs , and they want to buy from a company that’s going to follow through with software support. And for a long, long time, that’s meant pretty much one option: NVIDIA Shield TV . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The images published today show a device that looks pretty much like what we saw in renders the outlet shared in November , though in a dark gray color this time.

But we have a concrete update on the Pocket PLAY that clears up one of the biggest open questions about performance. In a new post on X , AYANEO confirmed that the Pocket PLAY will be powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 9300 chipset. It’s a familiar flagship chip — albeit dating back to 2023 — and should be a solid pick, even if it’s not the latest silicon or the Snapdragon chip some fans may have been hoping for.",
