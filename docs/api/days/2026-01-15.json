It cites conversations it's had with retailers and AIBs about the cards post-CES where both basically say that the RTX 5070 Ti cards that are out on the shelves right now are your lot. That's it. Supply dead. No more coming. Asus has apparently been explicit about this, stating to HUB that it has placed Asus RTX 5070 Ti cards into end-of-life (EoL) status due to the catastrophically low supply. \"This model is currently facing a supply shortage and as such they have placed the model into end-of-life status.\" Other manufacturers have been less to-the-point about it, while still noting they have pretty much zero supply of the RTX 5070 Ti. For what it's worth, this seems to be news to the Asus contacts I've spoken to, who certainly do not have a specific note about the card's EoL status from HQ in Taiwan right now. But of course, of course it's all about the memory crisis , where AI infrastructure demands have put huge strain on the supply of memory for data centres and has subsequently had a huge impact on the prices of not just DRAM, but also NAN…",

Furthermore, an already-existing fab is expected to start churning out wafers as soon as next month. This follows news earlier this week that the South Korean memory manufacturer planned to invest a further 19 trillion won (or $12.90 billion) into another advanced chip packaging facility in Cheongju. The company announced in December that it planned \"to invest approximately 30% of our sales in facilities in 2026 and accelerate the transition to 1c DRAM , but it will be difficult to resolve the supply shortage.\" Expanding production was always part of the plan—but the AI industry's demand for memory has been scaling up faster than production can match.

Wine, a compatibility app for running non-Linux games on Linux has just hit version 11.0. You can find the full list of changes in the release notes , but there are a few main takeaways (via Gaming on Linux ). The first is that WoW64 mode, which can run 32-bit applications, is now considered fully supported and even includes 16-bit apps. As Windows can't natively run 16-bit applications, it's now as hard (or as easy) to run 16-bit apps on Linux as on Windows. Another big update with Wine 11, following on from its introduction in development builds of Wine 10, is the introduction of kernel module NTsync support. With this, Linux can emulate Windows NT' synchronisation primitives, which might not mean much to you, but minimises latency for demanding games. How much that performance increases by depends on many factors, but we expect a gaming uplift of some kind going forward. Wayland, a display protocol, has seen a handful of improvements in Wine 11, too, with \"shaped and color-keyed windows\" being supported in the experimental driver.

Recent updates promise a complete overhaul to how content is released for the 12-year-old game, shifting to a seasonal pattern that should, the team hopes, make them far more agile. Especially when it comes to nixing quality of life and design bugbears which have been annoying the playerbase for years . I asked executive producer Susan Kath and game director Nick Giacomini how the studio had dealt with these blows and come back seemingly swinging for the fences. And while the response was understandably somber, both studio leads describe the atmosphere at ZeniMax as energised. \"Obviously last year was a tough year for the studio—as you said, for reasons we don't even necessarily need to dig into—but the team has very much rallied,\" Kath explains. \"I see a lot of enthusiasm from the team as we're goi…",

Which is still nearly four months away. Nevertheless, here we are in January 2026 with a bit more info on these forthcoming Ecco games. It's now confirmed that new California-based studio A&R Atelier is developing the new game, with original Ecco producer Ed Annunziata on board as chief creative officer. In a press release issued today A&R Atelier confirmed there are \"several new Ecco the Dolphin products and games\" in development, though whether these include the already-confirmed remasters and a new game, or something more, isn't specified. I've reached out to A&R Atelier for more specific details, though I assume they're keeping it under their hats for the big April reveal. I'll update if I hear back. In the press release Annunziata said that a new Ecco game \"has been years in the making\". It's unclear how big A&R Atelier studios is or who else might be working…",

My first job covering videogames was a mid-2000s internship at a website dedicated to cheat codes, tips, and walkthroughs. My job was to read the user submissions and determine which were genuine cheats or secrets, and which were schoolyard rumors, hoaxes, or insults that had been indiscriminately lobbed at me through an internet form because someone was bored and Twitter didn't exist yet. As you can guess, I read a lot of \"yo momma\" jokes and not many legit tips, but I did go looking for corroboration of even outlandish claims, because you never knew. Back then, new games weren't immediately autopsied by dataminers, and their secrets weren't comprehensively catalogued on wikis and YouTube. All we had were GameFAQs writers, official Prima guides, hearsay, and whatever we could verify directly.

Sure enough, just a month after the mod launched, it's gone. \"The Bully Online project is shutting down. Thank you all for playing,\" a message posted on the website of YouTube and project lead Swegta (via Insider Gaming ) now states. The Bully Online page on Swegta's website is already gone, as is the Mod DB page, although it can still be seen through the Internet Archive .

Giving a quick glance at some side-by-side screenshots it would be pretty easy to confuse the two, though that's not a huge surprise: Hypixel Studio, maker of Hytale, was founded by Minecraft modders and mappers who decided to create their own voxel game. Besides looks, Minecraft and Hytale have a ton in common: they both take place in \"infinite\" procedurally generated worlds with multiple biomes and deformable terrain, they both feature base-building and gear and weapon crafting, cooking, wildlife and fantasy monsters, and other similar systems. They can both be played solo or in co-op, they both have creative modes, and they're both moddable. And there's blocks. So many, many blocks. So… what's the actual difference between them? Why should you consider trying Hytale if you've already got Minecraft? 1. Hytale is very early access The biggest difference right now, frankly, is that Minecraft has been around for 15 years and Hytale just entered early access—and it's very early access.

Though I've since moved on, and that case has been stuck in storage for years. Now, finally— finally— we have a true successor in the Corsair Air 5400. The Air 5400 isn't just a rerun of old ideas. It's still a stocky cuboid, but where the Air 540 championed a dual-chamber design that has become the norm for PC cases, the Air 5400 offers a triple-chamber design. Think of it like three distinct zones: there's the main one, for showing off your build; the rear one, with plenty of room for cable management; and a third one, for mounting an all-in-one liquid cooler's radiator inside. The idea behind the third chamber is pretty simple. By mounting the radiator away from other components, and with ample airflow, hot air generated by the CPU can be efficiently expelled from the case and not warm anything around it. It also removes the need for the radiator to block precious fan mounting locations. It's a slick solution. The radiator is mounted toward the front of the…",

With such runaway memory prices, it's hardly surprising that sales of have seen a dip as a result—or that some folks are not even opting for last-gen hardware, but extremely old CPUs to make the most of last-last-gen memory. To be clear, DDR4 memory pricing isn't much more sensible than DDR5; according to TrendForce's latest report , \"the average spot price of mainstream chips (i.e., DDR4 1Gx8 3200 MT/s) has increased by 9.64% from US$25.407 last week (Jan.7) to US$27.857 this week (Jan.14).\" A near 10% price increase in just one week is huge. Understandably, many buyers are opting to hold off on upgrades, resulting in sluggish sales for both DDR5 and DDR4 memory. That's left DDR3 motherboard sales to take centre stage instead, apparently increasing between two and three times in the Chinese DIY market alone. Boards bundled up with 6th to 9th Generation Intel CPUs are apparently also getting a lot more attention (via Videocardz ). Supply has a huge impact on memory pricing. In the aforementioned case of DDR5 memory, there's less to go round in part thanks to the AI industry buying up a whol…",

Perlman is a very well known actor, with dozens of television and movie credits going back to the 1970s, but he's also very prolific as a voice actor in animation and videogames. Mobygames lists 33 titles with a Ron Perlman appearance, including Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, Halo 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, and of course the Fallout games. His turns in Fallout are especially interesting because they're his most iconic videogame work, and yet it's only four simple words: \"War. War never changes.\" The intro to each Fallout game spins off differently from there, but those four words are an essential pillar of the series, every bit as thematically foundational as power armor or Nuka Cola.

If you're thinking \"hold on a minute\" that's probably because you remember a time when Rockstar and Take Two weren't so happy about modders: Indeed the publisher accused FiveM of hosting code to \"facilitate piracy\", and banned three of the main creators from Rockstar games. This policy changed in 2022 as Rockstar eventually woke up to how massive, forward-thinking, and potentially profitable the whole modding and roleplay scene was. It then allowed non-commercial roleplay servers, as long as they didn't interfere with any official services, before moving on to just acquire Cfx.re outright. The new Cfx.re is a \"curated digital storefront\" that will offer assets, scripts and maps to players, and will host both free and paid-for content. Rockstar now hopes to give creators a place to share and sell their work, such as props, scripts, maps, \"and much more.\" (I…",

    "body": "The thrill of every great roguelike deckbuilder is, at its core, a simple one: make the numbers as big as they can go. It's surprisingly bold, then, that upcoming game Talystro turns that entirely on its head. On this little mouse's quest, the goal is instead to make specific numbers. Enemies don't have health, they simply are a number—as low as one or, in my experience so far, as high as 55 (terrifying!). To kill them, you need to generate an attack that meets that number exactly—only an 11 will beat an 11, or a 23 for a 23. In other words precision, not power, is king. (Image credit: Filiokus) Each round you roll a set of dice and draw a hand of cards. Dice slot into spaces on the cards, which add or subtract from their result in different ways. All cards with dice currently slotted contribute to your total attack number—once it's where you want it, you can launch it and destroy an enemy. It's partly a game of maths—faced with a set of numbers and modifiers, you're looking for the most direct ways to reach specific results. But it's also about resource management. With only so many dice and slots each round, the trick is using what you have as efficiently as possible. (Image cre…",

As entertaining as Robb and Hansen's well-established rapport is, the full 40-minute interview is also eye-opening . For a start, while we already know AI is a big reason why we're experiencing a supply crisis , Robb eloquently communicates the sheer scale of the industry's hunger for memory. He puts it in stark terms for Hansen, \"The AI companies bought, like, 40% of the wafer production. We're not even talking finished goods, like, packages—not even chips. They're just wafers.\" And what's even wilder is that a lot of that stock may not even be in active use, instead hoarded in storage as the industry struggles to find sufficient power to fit out functional data centers.
