Given an unlimited supply of people, how many dudes would you have to throw at the gorilla before it went down? 50? 100? Would the dudes and the gorillas be better served by turning against the masters that placed them in this arena in the first place? Those are some of the thoughts propelling How Many Dudes? a so-called \"dudebuilder\" roguelike where you amass an army of guys to pummel animals of varying quantities and sizes (and occasionally toddlers, I don't like to think about the toddlers). Really though, it's an auto-battler, and it's honestly a solid bit of fun. Here's how it works: At the end of each round, you get to either post a flyer to start recruiting a certain dude type (thus defining your build), recruit a dude, or get one of three relics. If you've played any roguelike ever, you get how the relics work—they're stacking buffs that you need to synergise with your build, yadda yadda. The real tug of war is in the knockout system.

QPAD has been around for a long time, and back in the day it was somewhat of a leader in gaming peripheral tech. In the early 2000s, I recall its mice and keyboards being recommended pretty often on various forums. QPAD didn't give me my first ever mechanical keyboard—that honour goes to the original Razer BlackWidow—but it gave me my second, becoming one of my favourite upgrades I've had over all my years PC gaming. Back then, the QPAD MK-50 was one of a handful of great value mechanical gaming keyboards in what was then a pretty niche market. That keyboard lasted me years, and offered simple quality for a great price. Then the company all but disappeared, (in the UK at least, where I'm based). But now it's back, with a new stack of products in the UK and hopefully elsewhere as QPAD looks to expand globally again. These products include the keyboard I'm happily typing away on right now, the Hall effect-boasting Flux 65 Model 5.

In fact, PC Gamer hasn’t reviewed many laptops with an RTX 5050 GPU. Creeping through the dusty stacks, marvelling at the symmetrical book stacking (just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947) and trying not to attract the attention of the librarian, I could find only one other point of reference: the Medion Erazer Scout 15 E1 . It didn’t do particularly well when put through the testing regime, which might have something to do with the Core i5 13420H and low, low price, but if you’re looking for PC gaming on a budget, it’s worth a look. The Asus TUF Gaming A16 takes the same GPU and mixes it with a much more interesting CPU. The AMD Ryzen 7 260 (from the Hawk Point generation) uses eight Zen 4 cores and can boost up to 5.1 GHz. It’s capable of Hyperthreading, or whatever AMD calls it, and each of those cores is a high-performance core, as AMD doe…",

And yet, such an abundance of hardware in a relatively simple device is also what makes them all the more compelling to tinker with—especially by, say, coaxing an unlikely kitchen device into running Doom. Case in point, German tech creator Aaron Christophel has got the original boomer shooter working on the touch screen of the Krups Cook4Me Smart cooking pot . It proves surprisingly easy to dismantle the kitchen appliance, with the bottom separating the heating elements from your counter top secured by a single screw (conversely, the separate touch screen module is firmly held in place with a whole two screws). The cooking pot's 'smarts' are down to the Renesas R7S721031VC SoC (system on a chip), which uses a 400 MHz Cortex-A9 microprocessor. Working in concert with 128 MB of RAM and 128 MB of Flash, these modest tech specs are more than enough to play 1993's Doom at a reasonable framerate. Actually getting the shooter onto the device also proves far from a challenge. Chr…",

It cites conversations it's had with retailers and AIBs about the cards post-CES where both basically say that the RTX 5070 Ti cards that are out on the shelves right now are your lot. That's it. Supply dead. No more coming. Asus has apparently been explicit about this, stating to HUB that it has placed Asus RTX 5070 Ti cards into end-of-life (EoL) status due to the catastrophically low supply. \"This model is currently facing a supply shortage and as such they have placed the model into end-of-life status.\" Other manufacturers have been less to-the-point about it, while still noting they have pretty much zero supply of the RTX 5070 Ti. For what it's worth, this seems to be news to the Asus contacts I've spoken to, who certainly do not have a specific note about the card's EoL status from HQ in Taiwan right now.

The company announced in December that it planned \"to invest approximately 30% of our sales in facilities in 2026 and accelerate the transition to 1c DRAM , but it will be difficult to resolve the supply shortage.\" Expanding production was always part of the plan—but the AI industry's demand for memory has been scaling up faster than production can match. Sungsoo Ryu, CEO of SK Hynix America, told Reuters this week, \"We have to support memory consumption for AI infrastructure.\" To clarify, Ryu shared that the company wou…",

    "body": "If you currently game on Linux, or plan to in the future, game support has just been improved once again. Wine, a compatibility app for running non-Linux games on Linux has just hit version 11.0. You can find the full list of changes in the release notes , but there are a few main takeaways (via Gaming on Linux ). The first is that WoW64 mode, which can run 32-bit applications, is now considered fully supported and even includes 16-bit apps. As Windows can't natively run 16-bit applications, it's now as hard (or as easy) to run 16-bit apps on Linux as on Windows. Another big update with Wine 11, following on from its introduction in development builds of Wine 10, is the introduction of kernel module NTsync support. With this, Linux can emulate Windows NT' synchronisation primitives, which might not mean much to you, but minimises latency for demanding games. How much that performance increases by depends on many factors, but we expect a gaming uplift of some kind going forward. Wayland, a display protocol, has seen a handful of improvements in Wine 11, too, with \"shaped and color-keyed windows\" being supported in the experimental driver. Clipboard support has now been implemented …",

As if that wasn't enough, Matt Frior, the director of ESO left after 20 years at the company as a result of that incident. The MMO, however, appears to be choosing hope. Recent updates promise a complete overhaul to how content is released for the 12-year-old game, shifting to a seasonal pattern that should, the team hopes, make them far more agile. Especially when it comes to nixing quality of life and design bugbears which have been annoying the playerbase for years . I asked executive producer Susan Kath and game director Nick Giacomini how the studio had dealt with these blows and come back seemingly swinging for the fences. And while the response was understandably somber, both studio leads describe the atmosphere at ZeniMax as energised. \"Obviously last year was a tough year for the studio—as you said, for reasons we don't even necessarily need to dig into—but the team has very much rallied,\" Kath explains. \"I see a lot of enthusiasm from the team as we're goi…",

It's now confirmed that new California-based studio A&R Atelier is developing the new game, with original Ecco producer Ed Annunziata on board as chief creative officer. In a press release issued today A&R Atelier confirmed there are \"several new Ecco the Dolphin products and games\" in development, though whether these include the already-confirmed remasters and a new game, or something more, isn't specified. I've reached out to A&R Atelier for more specific details, though I assume they're keeping it under their hats for the big April reveal. I'll update if I hear back.

My first job covering videogames was a mid-2000s internship at a website dedicated to cheat codes, tips, and walkthroughs. My job was to read the user submissions and determine which were genuine cheats or secrets, and which were schoolyard rumors, hoaxes, or insults that had been indiscriminately lobbed at me through an internet form because someone was bored and Twitter didn't exist yet. As you can guess, I read a lot of \"yo momma\" jokes and not many legit tips, but I did go looking for corroboration of even outlandish claims, because you never knew. Back then, new games weren't immediately autopsied by dataminers, and their secrets weren't comprehensively catalogued on wikis and YouTube.

Though I've since moved on, and that case has been stuck in storage for years. Now, finally— finally— we have a true successor in the Corsair Air 5400. The Air 5400 isn't just a rerun of old ideas. It's still a stocky cuboid, but where the Air 540 championed a dual-chamber design that has become the norm for PC cases, the Air 5400 offers a triple-chamber design. Think of it like three distinct zones: there's the main one, for showing off your build; the rear one, with plenty of room for cable management; and a third one, for mounting an all-in-one liquid cooler's radiator inside. The idea behind the third chamber is pretty simple. By mounting the radiator away from other components, and with ample airflow, hot air generated by the CPU can be efficiently expelled from the case and not warm anything around it. It also removes the need for the radiator to block precious fan mounting locations. It's a slick solution. The radiator is mounted toward the front of the…",

If you're thinking \"hold on a minute\" that's probably because you remember a time when Rockstar and Take Two weren't so happy about modders: Indeed the publisher accused FiveM of hosting code to \"facilitate piracy\", and banned three of the main creators from Rockstar games. This policy changed in 2022 as Rockstar eventually woke up to how massive, forward-thinking, and potentially profitable the whole modding and roleplay scene was. It then allowed non-commercial roleplay servers, as long as they didn't interfere with any official services, before moving on to just acquire Cfx.re outright. The new Cfx.re is a \"curated digital storefront\" that will offer assets, scripts and maps to players, and will host both free and paid-for content.

Oh, and The Elder Scrolls 6 is bubbling away in there somewhere. It doesn't feel like a lot of space to launch a humdinger of a Fallout remaster, is my point. But fans of those games are quite keen on the notion of prettied-up versions, and a recent Steam glitch had a few of them ready to declare that the prophecy would soon be fulfilled (by which I mean: a remaster or two were imminent). Fans over on Reddit have noticed something hinky going on with Fallout 3 and New Vegas over on Steam.

So, why not use 3.5-inch floppy disks. Like, over a thousand of 'em. This immediately throws up almost countless problems, starting with the circa 1.5 MB capacity of a double-sided variant of such a disk and the fact that they're not made any longer. That's before you even think about the technicalities. Factorio is a very small game by modern standards, taking up about 1 GB to 1.5 GB of storage space once installed. But that's absolutely massive if a floppy disk is your metric. Cost is an immediate problem, with 10 old-stock floppies apparently costing about $23, you're looking at about $2,500 in floppies adding in some spares.

Enemies don't have health, they simply are a number—as low as one or, in my experience so far, as high as 55 (terrifying!). To kill them, you need to generate an attack that meets that number exactly—only an 11 will beat an 11, or a 23 for a 23. In other words precision, not power, is king.

All cards with dice currently slotted contribute to your total attack number—once it's where you want it, you can launch it and destroy an enemy. It's partly a game of maths—faced with a set of numbers and modifiers, you're looking for the most direct ways to reach specific results. But it's also about resource management.

This soon became a problem when I needed to get softwood planks to upgrade the Farmer's Workbench for the first time. To save you the hassle that I went through, below I'll cover how to get softwood planks. It's not as simple as just chopping down the right type of tree, either, as you need to process the logs, too. Unless you're already a master builder, chances are you haven't had to do this yet. How to get softwood planks in Hytale Image 1 of 2 A beech tree. (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 An aspen tree. (Image credit: Hypixel) To get softwood planks in Hytale, you need to chop down beech or aspen trees to get their logs, and then turn them into planks using the Builder's Workbench. As you'll see in the images above, beech trees have moderately light brown logs and bright green leaves, while aspen trees have white speckled logs with orange leaves. If you've not used the Builder's Workbench before, this is where you'll create fancy, processed blocks that look great when building your own structures, like steps, win…",

If there isn't something to immediately sink its hooks into me, like a unique mechanic or a particularly whimsical world I can lose hours to, there's a much higher chance of me bouncing off. Given how many life simulators are churned out each year it's unsurprising but, for someone who has dedicated so much time to this one genre, it's disappointing to feel that way. Fortunately, the pastel-coloured, My Sims-esque world of Heartopia came along just as I felt myself disconnecting from life sims entirely. And, while it's by no means perfect and there are a number of bugs (like the fact it keeps snowing inside of my house) I keep coming back each day to check in with my little avatar and see what quests are waiting and what daily rewards I can redeem. But, one feature of the game above all else is what keeps me so captivated in its world: the introduction of hobbies. In a lot of the life simulators I've played in the past, you're usually given the same few tasks to pass the time with: gardening, fishing, deco…",

    "body": "Having written about games and hardware for over a decade, believe me when I say an even slightly candid interview is a rare treat. As such, Kyle Hansen's live-streamed, down-to-earth chat with memory manufacturer Patriot's marketing manager Shannon Robb about all things system memory was a particular delight during CES 2026. As entertaining as Robb and Hansen's well-established rapport is, the full 40-minute interview is also eye-opening . For a start, while we already know AI is a big reason why we're experiencing a supply crisis , Robb eloquently communicates the sheer scale of the industry's hunger for memory. He puts it in stark terms for Hansen, \"The AI companies bought, like, 40% of the wafer production. We're not even talking finished goods, like, packages—not even chips. They're just wafers.\" And what's even wilder is that a lot of that stock may not even be in active use, instead hoarded in storage as the industry struggles to find sufficient power to fit out functional data centers. Robb later adds that companies like Patriot aren't the reason for the sky-high RAM prices consumers are seeing, echoing similar comments recently made by Micron . He quips, \"Trust me, we're …",
