Even though I was over the bronchitis and back on stage at the Westgate Las Vegas, my wonderful doctor ordered an MRI just to make sure that everything was OK,&#8221; Manilow, 82, began. &#8220;The MRI discovered a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed. It&#8217;s pure luck (and a great doctor) that it was found so early. That&#8217;s the good news.&#8221; He added that now his Christmas shows are done, he is undergoing surgery to have the cancer removed. &#8220;The doctors do not believe it has spread and I&#8217;m taking tests to confirm their diagnosis,&#8221; he shared. &#8220;So, that&#8217;s it.

The story of the holiday is often referred to by the poem&#8217;s most famous first line: &#8220;&#8216;Twas the night before Christmas.&#8221; Hetfield&#8217;s version debuted on Friday (Dec. 19) on the band&#8217;s Maximum Metallia SiriusXM channel and then migrated to the band&#8217;s Instagram page, where it was accompanied by a cartoon image of a crackling fire. The group members&#8217; stockings were, of course, hung with care, one for drummer Lars Ulrich, another for Hetfield, as well as ones for bassist Robert Trujillo and guitarist Kirk Hammett.

    "body": "كشف تقرير صحفي إنجليزي، اليوم الإثنين، عن رغبة نادي توتنهام في ضم المصري عمر مرموش، مهاجم مانشستر سيتي، في يناير المقبل. وانضم مرموش إلى مانشستر سيتي، في يناير الماضي، قادمًا من آينتراخت فرانكفورت، ورغم بدايته المميزة في النصف الثاني من الموسم الماضي، ومشاركته بشكل مستمر، إلا أن بالكاد يحصل على فرص للمشاركة هذا الموسم. وبحسب شبكة \"تيم توك\" الإنجليزية، فإن السبيرز يسعون لضم مرموش، في فترة الانتقالات الشتوية، بعد فشلهم في ضم البرازيلي سافينيو، جناح السيتي أيضًا، في الصيف الماضي. ولفت التقرير، إلى أن توتنهام اتجه للتعاقد مع مرموش، كبديل لأنطوان سيمينو، لاعب بورنموث، والذي يفضل الانتقال لصفوف ليفربول. وأضاف التقرير، إلى أن بيب جوارديولا، مدرب السيتي، يتمسك ببقاء عمر مرموش، رغم عدم الاعتماد عليه بشكل أساسي، لكن توتنهام يرغب في استعارته خلال شهر يناير مع وضع بند خيار الشراء. وسيراقب توتنهام المستويات التي سيقدمها مرموش خلال بطولة أمم إفريقيا مع منتخب مصر، قبل بدء مفاوضات ضمه من صفوف مانشستر سيتي.",

An experimental Switch-style overlay menu and improved graphics handling stand out in the update. Android, macOS, and less common devices, such as Chromebooks, now receive better or expanded support. The Eden Switch emulator has just pushed out another substantial update, though extensive as it is, this one focuses on evolution rather than revolution. Version 0.0.4 is now live, bringing performance enhancements, game fixes, and expanded device support across Android, PC , and macOS. As detailed in the GitHub changelog , there is at least one new feature of Eden v0.0.4 you’ll probably notice right away. It now has an experimental overlay menu that works a bit like the real Switch. Once enabled, holding the Home button brings it up, making it feel more natural to jump into system-style options than to back out to the main app every time.",

We previously saw that this feature was in development in July, and it’s now rolling out broadly. Google’s made it even easier to find pictures of people in the Google Photos app. Photos has always offered an optional feature called Face Groups that groups similar faces together, creating automatically updating albums of all your pictures of any given person or pet, and today, Google announced that that feature is being more directly integrated into the app’s search functions. The change was quietly announced this morning by Google in a help forum post. Now, if you have Face Groups enabled, both Ask Photos and the app’s “classic search” feature prominently display a row of faces. Tapping any of the pictures in that row will take you to all the photos you have of that person or pet. We first caught a glimpse of this feature in an APK teardown back in July, and today, the change seems to be rolling out broadly.",

Lauren-Shriner was charged with two felony counts and later pled not guilty to charges of discharging a firearm with gross negligence and assault with a semiautomatic firearm, a downgrade from the more serious charges she faced when she was initially booked on suspicion of attempted murder . Lauren-Shriner told RS that she can&#8217;t discuss certain aspects of the case for legal reasons, but with the case sti…",

But a few years later, the limitations of telescopic controllers are really starting to grate on me. For starters, they’re not very portable. Early models, like the first Razer Kishi, folded up into a smallish square, but newer models all have the same H-shaped design that doesn’t pack up nearly as neatly. As my bag has slowly filled up with coloring books, crayons, cards, and other things to keep my kids entertained, bag space has increasingly come at a premium. Bulky telescopic controllers didn’t make the cut.",

The phone is expected to feature a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, positioning it below the recently launched OnePlus 15R. We’re unsure if the said phone is the Nord 6, the OnePlus Turbo, or any other. With the earlier-than-usual unveiling of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, followed by the less powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, we’ve already seen Android flagships lining up for global launch. Although Samsung is expected to delay its announcement of the Galaxy S26 series , OnePlus’ flagship, the OnePlus 15 , is already up for sale in global markets. The brand also recently followed up with the launch of the OnePlus 15R , much sooner than the typical launch cycle. Now, with the spare time on its hands, OnePlus is working on less premium options, and one of them is already emerging in leaks and may launch soon. Per fresh leaks, OnePlus is gearing up to launch yet another phone set for global markets. Leaker Abhishek Yadav recently posted on X that a OnePlus phone codenamed “Volkswagen” is under development.",

In a post on X , Retroid said it had intended to keep the Early Bird price through January. However, it has already burned through its initial memory supply, and replenishing stock now means paying “significantly higher prices.” With that, the company somewhat apologetically states it can’t sustain the discount.",

The device could closely resemble Apple’s rumored foldable iPhone in terms of size and shape. Unlike the tall Galaxy Z Fold 7, this model would prioritize stability and easier reading. Samsung is expected to launch it alongside its usual Fold, expanding its foldable lineup to three devices next year. The Wide Fold is also expected to feature 25W wireless charging. Samsung isn’t done experimenting with foldable form factors. After launching the Galaxy Z TriFold , rumor has it that the company is working on another foldable phone design, a wide one to counter Apple’s upcoming foldable iPhone. Now, a new report from South Korea’s ETNews has revealed more details about this new Samsung foldable and how it might compare to Apple’s competing device.",

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority There are plenty of mixed opinions on AI’s potential benefits and harms , but I’ll admit I’ve been somewhat hooked on it from day one. I tend to dive deep into subjects with AI for short bursts that might last hours or on-and-off for a few days, and then drift away for weeks or more when life gets busy with things that are obviously more important. Slowly but surely, though, I realized I was doing less and less when it came to other personal interests. While my AI use never disrupted my real-life obligations or relationships, it was starting to cannibalize my hobbies. Recently, I started scrolling through my massive ChatGPT log entries. Some were simple entertainment, and others were deep thoughts that frankly got a bit heavy. There were more interactions than I’d ever care to count. That’s when the thought hit me: “Has this become my new doom scroll?” I started wondering how I got to that point, how much time I was wasting, and why it felt so addictive. Eventually, I took a deeper look at my AI usage patterns and then took a step back.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority OnePlus typically launches its flagship with an R-branded companion. The latter is characterized by slightly less impactful specifications, including a relatively dull display, a less appealing camera, or a generation-old processor. This year, however, the OnePlus 15R has earned a separate launch, independent of the OnePlus 15 ‘s shadow. That’s because the gap between the two phones is closing, as they share several features on their spec sheets, and these similarities help elevate the OnePlus 15R closer to the status of a flagship Android phone — even though it’s still a flagship-killer at heart . My colleague Joe Maring reviewed the OnePlus 15R and wasn’t quite convinced it is the appropriate update to the 13R, especially given the downgraded cameras, OxygenOS 16’s shift towards an iOS-like aesthetic, and a $100 price bump. While I don’t disagree, I view the OnePlus 15R as packing all the essential bits from the flagship 15, especially for those craving performance and longevity. And if you’re not looking for the swankiest of features, the OnePlus 15R may be worth your consideration.",

    "body": "With the release of Android 12 back in 2021, Google made a somewhat controversial change to the Quick Settings panel. Gone were the individual toggles for Wi-Fi and mobile data. In their place was a new, expandable Internet tile that housed the old mobile data and Wi-Fi toggles. The change aimed to simplify things for users, but it had the side effect of making it more tedious to toggle Wi-Fi and mobile data. Years after rolling out this change, though, Google may be on the verge of reversing it in a future update to Android 16 .

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Android 16’s first major update made me fall back in love with Quick Settings. After Android 12 took away the smaller toggles and switched to the large pill-shaped buttons in the name of Material You, I started using Quick Settings less and less. See, any time a button is hidden away from my eyes and requires more than one or two swipes or taps, I just forget it exists. And this is what happened for me with Quick Settings on Android 12 to 15; I set up the ones I used the most up front and forgot about the rest. Android 16 QPR1 brought the ability to collapse each large pill into half its size and thus fit more toggles on one screen, and that’s what I immediately did. I now had more space to try new things with Quick Settings, like launch apps or start actions inside apps, but I blanked out for a while, not finding the right way to use the extra space. That is, until I realized that the action I needed the most is to control my smart home in general, and my standing desk in particular.",

Don’t get me wrong, Samsung phones are made in both of these countries, but the devil is in the details.

With both song searches and voice input, we’re able to get responses from Google that contain voice output. We’re also seeing a new floating button for continuing your search in AI Mode. Google gives us a ton of different ways to look up information, and the form in which it delivers those results can vary a lot based on how we choose to interact with it — type a text search in your browser, and you get your results back as text. Use voice input for Gemini , and you get a voice response. But sometimes that doesn’t always work the way we’d expect, and today we’re checking out what could be some upcoming changes to how Google communicates with us in response to using its Pixel home screen widget .

As reported by 9to5Google , Google Play and YouTube have now been restored as Movies Anywhere partners. Disney owns Movies Anywhere, and the service dropped Google support during the dispute, resulting in a break in cross-platform syncing.

NBCUniversal’s streaming video service, Peacock, offers two tiers of subscriptions. After its steepest price hike a few months ago, the ad-supported Premium tier costs $10.99 per month, while you will have to shell out $16.99 per month for the ad-free Premium Plus tier. As if the existing ads in the Premium tier weren’t enough, Peacock has the bright idea to add even more ads to the Premium tier — this time, showing ads right when the app starts up.

Instead of Windows 11 or an ROG Ally-style Xbox interface, this Legion Go 2 version is expected to run SteamOS. SteamOS is likely to improve users’ experience with better power management and a console-like interface. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 gaming handheld was first showcased at the CES 2025 conference, but it didn’t make it to the market as late as the October. So, an upgraded version makes little sense. However, Lenovo may be looking to expand options for potential buyers by offering another variant that runs SteamOS instead of Windows. As per a recent leak, Lenovo may be gearing up to reveal this new variant of the Legion Go 2 at CES 2026, exactly a year after the first reveal. Windows Latest says the step to introduce a new variant stems from the unoptimized Windows experience on the small screen. While Lenovo had the option to choose the Xbox full-screen experience (FSE) , as did with the 2025 variants of ASUS ROG Ally and Ally X. However, it appears to have gone with SteamOS for its advantages, including lower hardware requirements, better power management,…",

Along with almost every other element of the platform, YouTube has been tinkering with how feedback works on Shorts for a while. The experimenting continues, and some viewers are about to see another switch-up. This time, YouTube is testing a new take on the Dislike button that affects both its placement and exact meaning. In a post on the Google Support forums , YouTube says it’s experimenting with folding “Dislike” and “Not interested” into a single thumbs-down option for Shorts. Rather than sitting on the main video UI, the button will now be tucked away behind the three-dot menu. Depending on the test group, it may appear as “Dislike” or “Not interested,” but the action itself remains the same.",

It had to be, owing to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5’s improved architecture , OnePlus’ abiding emphasis on internal cooling tech, the new highly responsive 165Hz display, and the brand’s general fidelity to users who expect more than just the basics from their phones. But my colleagues’ initial reactions to the phone shook that conviction. In their initial testing, my colleague Robert Triggs found the new phone running at nearly scorching temperatures . That’s a good thing if you’re near the North Pole, helping Santa pack gifts for kids. But for the rest of us mere mortals, those temperatures — I’m talking about nearly 53°C (127°F) on the surface, were bothersome, and especially harrowing for mobile gamers who intend to use it for several dozen minutes, if not hours, holding the phone in their hands while fragging foes in leading FPS games.",

We’ve found OpenAI testing this feature with ChatGPT’s latest Android version. It could allow shortcuts for an unlimited number of chats to be added to the homescreen.

You can already pin conversations within the app or the web interface, for convenience, but accessing favorite chats is going to become a little easier on Android.
