Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. Have you seen this Battlefield 6 map? It's called Saints Quarter, and I wouldn't blame you for forgetting (or only now realizing) it exists. Until yesterday, I'd only played on it by accident. Saints Quarter is an anomaly in Battlefield 6's map pool, because it's the only map that's exclusively infantry-only. The most popular modes like Conquest, Rush, and Breakthrough are incompatible with Saints Quarter, so you'll only encounter it in 8v8 playlists like Team Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. (If you also forgot Battlefield 6 had those modes, you're forgiven twice.) I don't fire up Battlefield 6 looking for cramped city streets and small teams—it's all about the big maps, baby—but I have to give Saints Quarter credit. It's not my favorite Battlefield 6 map, but it might be its most successful. In essence, Saints Quarters represents Battlefield Studios' best stab at the Call of Duty experience. It's designed top-to-bottom…",

I'm not talking about Her Story, or The Bunker, or Late Shift: the most recent wave is coming pretty much entirely from Asia, spanning China, Japan, Korea and Singapore. There are seriously a lot of these: in the second half of 2025 alone we've had Heartbeat in Thailand, Such a Guy, Road to Empress, and Love Begins With Goodbye. Most are centred around romance and themed similarly to visual novels: you're a guy, there are a handful of women to talk to, and your choices determine which woman you'll end up hooking up with. Sometimes it's as simple as that: sometimes there's a bit of heart-pumping action involved. At Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week I saw a game called Island of Hearts, which releases early next year and is ostensibly a \"big deal\" as far as these FMV dating sims games go. It's published by 4Divinity for one—a Singapore-based publisher with a growing profile in Asia.

When I'm expected to run and jump sidescroll-ways, my brain responds like a cornered animal. My hands can't be trusted, and nobody is safe—least of all me. Today, that's begun to change thanks to This Is No Cave. It's a minimalist sci-fi platformer, where you play as a charming little yellow-suited astronaut attempting to escape their crash landing on an alien planet by using their boot thrusters and grappling hook to fling their tumbling body through a labyrinth of subterranean tunnels. (Those tunnels, I'm told, are not a cave.) The secret to making 2D movement manageable for me, it turns out, is to take the buttons out of my hands. In This Is No Cave, movement is controlled with mouseclicks: Left click jumps and fires suit thrusters to launch yourself towards my cursor, while right click latches onto grapple points with my grappling hook. That's it. The simplicity of controls, however, doesn't detract from the complexity of the platforming…",

It seems Fletcher is a bit of an art snob, and he wants Phyre to scrub Seattle clean of the non-Camarilla Kindred graffiti. Sounds easy enough, but there are 30 Anarch Tags to hunt down and Seattle is an awfully big place. Bloodlines 2 helps with the search by making its circular crosshair grow in size when you're close to something valuable, but who knows what that something is.

They aren't hanging around as random spawns in the middle of the map though, so you'll need to find them at their camp a little off the beaten path. Rampaging Scavenger location in Escape From Duckov You'll find the Rampaging Scavenger camp in the clearing marked by red swords on the southwest corner of the map. (Image credit: Team Soda) You can find Rampaging Scavengers in their camp south of the Forest Path . It's tucked away off to the left of the dirt path west of the bunker entrance. Just keep heading left until you see a break in the fence line heading south. Once you take that small detour you can't miss 'em. They're bright red, very fast, and wielding those butcher knives you need to loot off them to complete the Hunter's Path quest. In my experience there are two to three of them spawned in that camp and you'll want to be careful when aggroing them because they will chase you all the way back to…",

    "body": "It's not immediately obvious how to save in Bloodliness 2 , and boy it sucks (in the not fun vampire way) to lose your progress in a lengthy RPG. Even knowing that Bloodlines 2 was pivoting to a more action game style, it's not the save system I expected, so fear not if you're scratching your head. The good news is, no, you aren't daft . I spent ages searching for the option too, but there is no manual save in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2. The system is a tad barebones and what you see from the beginning is what you get. Unless you're willing to repeat quests completely, the vampire RPG makes you dig Phyre's grave, then lie in it. How do you save in Bloodliness 2? The only way to save in Bloodlines 2 is its auto-save system which keeps your progress through vampire-infested Seattle. When an auto-save is in progress, you'll see an icon in the top right corner of the screen that looks like the Anarch Tags spraypainted around the city. Quitting the game doesn't trigger a save, either, in my experience. From the settings window, Bloodlines 2 warns that you'll lose any unsaved progress by selecting 'Exit to Main Menu,' so make a mental note of your last checkpoint before clos…",

Battlefield 6's Portal browser promised a slice of '07 FPS culture : custom rulesets, weird maps, and community servers with a revolving door of regulars. That all went up in smoke on launch day, as XP farm lobbies started cropping up en masse, clogging up all the server space so badly that nobody else could host anything for days.

In an interview with FRVR , former Bethesda designer Bruce Nesmith said that while he thinks it's \"a good game,\" Starfield failed to live up to its potential because its reliance on procedurally generated content didn't align with what players expected from a Bethesda RPG. (Image credit: Tyler C. / Bethesda) \"I don't think it's in the same calibre as the other two, Fallout or Skyrim—or Elder Scrolls, rather—but I think it's a good game,\" said Nesmith, who worked as a systems designer on Starfield until a year before release. \"I worked on it. I'm proud of the work I did. I'm proud of the work that the people I knew did on it.

It's an issue for Starbreeze, which has a long history of great and interesting games but for the past decade has been basically a Payday studio. Thing is, Payday 2 is so popular that it's had to continue to support the older game, which now has so much DLC that last month saw the launch of a subscription service (which is actually a pretty good deal, though some groused about it anyway). Now Starbreeze has announced that Payday 2's maintenance and future content is all being handled by Sidetrack Games, which has previously created several pieces of Payday 2 DLC. \"We're excited to announce that we’re partnering with Sidetrack Games to support the PC-versions of Payday 2 with quality-of-life improvements and general game fixes,\" says the Starbreeze statement . \"Sidetrack (formerly known as the M.U.G.

Our Alex says this controller is \"solid all over\" and praises the texture grips and great build quality. That's not all Razer's latest has going for it though. It comes with programmable buttons, plus a sequence of back paddles, and the triggers can be adjusted to swap travel distance. If you like a long press from your triggers, flip it one way.

But while the Ace is half the cost, it still sports a very steep price tag for a mere motherboard. So what exactly are you getting for $500 that you don't get with a $250 model? Let's start with the most eye-popping feature, the number of USB ports on the rear IO panel. At first glance, it would seem that you get four Type-C and 11 Type-A sockets for USB devices, but that's only half the story. Like many mainstream and high-end Core Ultra 200S motherboards, the MEG Z890 Ace sports two Thunderbolt 4 ports. These support up to 40 Gbps in Thunderbolt 4 mode, 20 Gbps in USB4 mode, or 10 Gbps when operating as USB 3.2 Type-C sockets, as well as providing DisplayPort 2.1 outputs.

Being familiar with extraction games actually does you a disservice on this detail because most others boot you out into the map and make you spend several runs trying to find a foothold with gear to get your first true extraction. Duckov is actually a lot more forgiving than that, it just won't tell you so. If you're like me you probably went at least five early runs dead as a duck trying to extract by going through the Northwest Camp without realizing the bunker entrance is also a valid exit point too.

Unlike Payday, which has a much more grounded setting, Den of Wolves wears its sci-fi inspirations on its sleeve.

Still, \"the freedom we have with this sci-fi space is a bit terrifying,\" admits Anders Svärd, 10 Chambers' master artist. This futuristic shooter has a suitably futuristic locale: the dystopian Midway City, a lawless, corporation-controlled metropolis built in the middle of the Pacific ocean between Japan and the US. Taking visual cues from Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City, with buildings piled on top of each other, as well as Stockholm with its sea-level waterways, Midway is the perfect FPS playground.

With one solitary exhaust fan at the rear and no visible ventilation anywhere else, I'd like to note. Luckily, the hardware inside isn't likely to cause too much financial distress if it melts itself into oblivion, as the whole setup is said to have cost €130. That's around $150, for those of you that only speak in God's own currency. Anyway, it's got a decade-old Intel Xeon E5-2673 v3 CPU at its heart, in combination with a luxurious 16 GB of DDR3 RAM (that feels weird to type at this point) and a GTX 960 trucking away in the GPU slot.

According to Caleb in a video posted today , the story increasingly goes that OLED is running out of time and will soon be replaced by RGB mini-LED technology. In part that's thanks to developments like Sony's decision to drop its top rung OLED TV in favour of RGB mini-LED tech and also Samsung's similar micro RGB TV tech . This narrative is likewise driven by the idea that OLED is difficult and expensive to make, which it is, and that consumers are increasingly preferring larger and larger TVs, which they are. That cost problem for OLED is only amplified as panel sizes increase. 85-inch plus OLEDs are crazy money. At the same time, there's the OLED brightness thing, with full-panel brightness remaining a fraction of that achieved by LCD TV with LED backlights. Oh, and the whole burn-in fiasco. Enter RGB mini-LED tech, which is being pitched as the next big thing. Bigger, brighter and plain just better than OLED. And exit OLED, right? As Caleb points …",

It's the best handheld gaming PC in many respects, but not really worth all that money, and while it's lacking in some key features, it's apparently easily upgradeable. This last point has come to light thanks to iFixit's recent disassembly of the handheld. The ROG Xbox Ally X has been given the teardown treatment, and it turns out it's surprisingly easily upgradeable, at least in some ways. This has earned it a 7/10 score from iFixit, which isn't quite the 10/10 it awarded the Framework laptop , but is still pretty impressive, especially for a handheld. It's also upgradeable in ways that should be very relevant to many ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X owners (presumably the same applies to the non-X version, too, even though that wasn't tested). This is particularly true when it comes to storage and thumbsticks. The $1,000 handheld comes with a 1 TB SSD, which is decent for a handheld, but if you're paying gaming PC prices for a handheld, more storage than this would be nice.

I'm ridiculously resistant to changing my habits, and even I am starting to consider keeping an AI chatbot open rather than Google for quick research. So really, it's little surprise that Wikipedia is apparently seeing fewer human pageviews lately. That's according to Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation, who says that over the past few months, the site has seen a \"decrease of roughly 8% as compared to the same months in 2024\" in human pageviews. After updating its bot detection systems, the Foundation \"found that much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.\" \"We believe that these declines reflect the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,\" says Miller, \"especially with search engines providing answers directly to searchers, often based on Wikipedia content.\" The AI answers that Google spits up top of the SERPs, in my experience, tend to reference articles from publications—such as yours truly—more so than Wikipedia.

At the time, there were few other models to choose from, but that's considerably changed over the months, and MSI faces stiff competition at this price point. The Z890 Tomahawk's original MSRP was $300, though you're more likely to find it around the $260 mark, and while that's not a huge reduction, it brings it more in line with boards from ASRock and Gigabyte. That's not the only thing that's changed since last year, as the performance of Arrow Lake has noticeably improved due to a wealth of microcode, BIOS, and Windows updates. In gaming, Core Ultra 200S still lag behind AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, though. MSI's Tomahawk series of motherboards has been around since 2018, as part of its budget and mainstream selection of products, sporting the MAG (MSI Arsenal Gaming) moniker.

According to a post by the developer on Bluesky, it's already sold 300,000 copies just in the first five days of being on sale. For context, that's comparable numbers to indie mega-hit Balatro , which sold 500,000 in its first 10 days and has since gone on to sell in the millions. 300,000!!!in 5 DAYSThank you all!!!!🏐🏐🏐🎉🎉 — @ballxpit.com ( @ballxpit.com.bsky.social ) 2025-10-21T13:27:28.935Z In that time, it's also hit a peak concurrent player count of nearly 35,000 —again, within spitting distance of Balatro's 45,000, and in less than a week. I definitely recommend checking out for yourself, if that popularity has piqued your interest. As I said in my review, Ball X Pit is \"a roller coaster ride of ball-bouncing action that loves to break its own rules\". It combines Breakout-inspired action with Vampire Survivors-like roguelike progression and even a substantial city-building element between runs, and the result is an absolutely deadly 'one more run' effect. Does this mean it's on track to be the next huge phenomenon? All things…",

This (up to) 27-item bundle from Magpie Games contains a couple of other solid systems, too—Avatar Legends (based off Avatar: The Last Airbender) and Root: The Roleplaying Game are included, alongside the gothic horror TTRPG Bluebeard's Pride—which sees players acting out different aspects of a newly wed's psyche as she uncovers the misdeeds of her new captor. I cannot recommend Masks enough. I kid you not, I am literally going to be playing my regular Tuesday game this evening. It's the third Masks campaign I've played with this group, in which I'm an Outsider who's starting to properly unravel her feelings about her people's past attempts to conquer Earth (they're aliens in a comic book, so they did a pretty bad job of it).

A simple enough concept, but let's just say this one spiralled a bit. And then some. This incredible desk contains 74 hexagonal frames, 44 of which house 37 active RGB cells. Each multi-layered cell can display its status via perspex inserts and multiple LEDs (via Hackaday ). Between the cells are pathways along which the bees travel, again with RGB lights. All told, there are 3,745 LEDs. It's all controlled by software that Full Stack Woodworking also built. And the resulting bee hive simulation is utterly beguiling. But hold that thought, because this labour of love deserves describing. This is a hugely complex desk build. Just making the top layer of the cell frames from African hard wood was an incredibly involved process, requiring several steps to prepare uniformly thin strips of wood ready to be laser cut. Full Stack Woodworking worked three sessions a day making the top hex frame layer—before work, after work, and before bed. And it took 25 days to …",

Well, they're all big ones, but this is a big one for a new reason . Poison Song means players are finally getting \"one of the holy grails that TR players [have] been waiting for more than twenty years—the ability to join House Indoril.\" This is either the most hype-inducing sentence you've ever heard, or completely meaningless (if you are normal), so let me try to break it down. Base Morrowind let you join any of three different Houses—Morrowind-native political factions that, conveniently, pretty much mapped to each corner of the Fighter-Mage-Thief triad. There was Hlaalu, the Empire-sympathetic merchant guild; Redoran, the traditionalist fighter sect; and Telvanni, dickhead wizards who live in mushrooms.

Taro was shown an image of a signed copy of the Nier Reincarnation OST being sold on Vinted, a site typically used for more noble purposes, like reselling clothes or old books. Mind, flogging a signed something-or-other isn't inherently scummy (times are tough!) but what isn't great is faking the signature entirely. \"This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine,\" Taro says, before adding that \"I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.\" Oof. This has naturally led to a flurry of people asking whether or not their autographs are genuine, or sharing genuine ones—which sort of defeats the point, though I imagine ol' Taro switches it up from time to time.

Though the 8BitDo Retro R8 owes arguably both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses to that commitment. The version I have my hands on is the N edition. Based on an old school Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, to you and me), it's covered in a pale, warm-toned grey colouring, punctuated with a smattering of reds and blacks, plus grey on the base. It's perhaps the most interesting-looking mouse I've tested in years, and the same can be said about the translucent green Xbox edition . The second you pick up this mouse, you will feel every one of its singular design choices. The ends are angular, rather than the grooves we've come to expect from most mice, and the left and right side-buttons are recessed into the frame of the mouse itself.

It's a platformer focused on fluid, momentum-based motion through stylish one-screen levels, and I can't recommend it enough: nothing else feels like this game. In my 92/100 review I practiced no restraint at all. \"In some ways N++ feels like the end of the action platformer,\" I wrote, \"like an exhaustive final document, a catalogue of its emotional highs and lows.\" I stand by those words mostly because, ten years later, I still play N++ occasionally.

But that doesn't mean I'm not excited for Ten++, which is a sizeable new update adding even more levels I doubt I'll ever finish. The free update includes new levels for the solo, multiplayer and race modes, as well as six new color schemes and \"a few assorted bugfixes\".

Unrelatedly, the Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 release date is imminent , and those of us who have been eagerly awaiting the game since its original 2019 announcement are finally about to get our hands on it. Our Fraser's already played it and found that, while it might not be the RPG its ancestor was, it's still a rollocking vamp story. Bloodlines 2 is due out October 21, and you'll have to wait for its full launch to actually play. No advanced or early access here, folks. In fact, not even much in the way of pre-order DLC since Paradox sheepishly folded the Toreador and Lasombra clans into the base game. Still, if you just… love spending money, there's still a little time to preorder and get a \"Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox\" for your haven. To be fair, the Bloodlines 1 OST does rip, but I'm not entirely sure it rips hard enough to get me to pre-order a game. Anyway, whether you're juked up or not, here are the Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 release dates for your region. When is the Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 unlock time?

In addition to lethal high-explosive shells, its description says it can launch \"smoke shells to conceal troop movement.\" Conceptually, it's easy to imagine the utility that might offer: If you know your team is about to make a big push, you can launch a preemptive smoke shell to provide some cover without needing to lob a smoke grenade by hand.
