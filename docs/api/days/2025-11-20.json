WoW still has plenty of adherents, no doubt, but it's not that strength which in old days moved Earth and Heaven. And nothing really feels like it's replaced it; there's no big, singular, dominant MMO but instead a collection of them, all of decent but not gargantuan popularity. Anyway, I think this is because none of them let you ride up to five camels simultaneously. Where Winds Meet is NetEase's hot new wuxia MMO with a whole lot of players , several demonic geese , and some lamentable LLM-powered NPCs . I'm not here to talk about any of that. I'm here to talk about its mounts which are, I must admit, the best I've seen in a videogame. 'This is hyperbole,' you're surely thinking.

Well, it has something to do with promising your game wouldn't be pay-to-win , and then basically making it pay-to-win anyway. Players not entirely up-to-date on the developer's latest plans logged in to find that power-granting items were available to be purchased through Quna , Aion 2's in-game currency. It doesn't help that, while the game is free-to-play, it also has two tiers of monthly subscriptions available. The cheapest offers basic functionalities like trading and auction house usage, which aren't available if you're playing for free. I should note that, in other MMOs, these sorts of limitations are a sign you're playing a trial, not a free-to-play game.

Welcome tweaks, of course, but no real swings at specific weapons and items. And that's not completely unwarranted, as I'd say most guns are pretty well-balanced right now. But while everyone's been singing the praises of the Anvil as a weapon that shoots far above its weight, the Venator has been the sleeper pick all along for PvP. Firing two shots at once, this rare pistol was capable of dropping other players blazingly fast. It was only a matter of time until the reaper came knocking, and that day is today with the 1.3.0 patch notes .

    "summary": "2026 is predicted to be better still.",
    "body": "Nvidia has just announced its latest financial results and, who'd a thunk it, the company has beaten expectations—and fears of an AI bubble burst—with record revenues. Overall, Nvidia raked in $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025 . That's 62% up on the same quarter in 2024 and 22% up on Q2 2025. It was enough to have CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang comment, \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.\" Reflecting the importance of Nvidia not just to the ongoing AI boom but the entire global economy, markets across the world rallied in response to Nvidia's record earnings. Nvidia's own share price went up, too, inevitably. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia's current share price of around $196 in after hours trading is still well down on its October peak of $212, perhaps reflecting that even these new and impressive results aren't enough to entirely erase concerns over a mooted AI bubble and what might happen if it bursts. As for the future, Nvidia is predicting even higher revenues. It has next quarter pencilled in at $65 billion and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress predicted another $350 billion in AI GPU sales between now and the end of 2026.…",

But, to my surprise, we've left the planet for a more galactic adventure this time around, though it won't be the farm life we're used to. That's right, Stardew Valley has teamed up with Among Us to bring a bundle of 29 themed cosmetics for your little avatar, so you no longer have to rely on the sprout hat. This package includes things like a Krobus and Junimo Pet, a Mayor Lewis outfit, and a Linius outfit, among many others which will let you cosplay as Abigail, Sebastian, and Mr Qi. No matter how rogue your favourite character is in Stardew, it seems Among Us have tried to create an outfit for everyone in their Cosmicube. For those who don't know what that means, a Cosmicube is basically a bundle of themed cosmetics which you can buy for in-game currency, which in this case is Beans. So there's no need to spend the day growing crops and fishing to be able to afford this one. You'll be able to spend your hard-earned cash as either an imposter or a crewmate, the only catch is you need to play these games to completion rather…",

It's very sharp and stylish, and Mielgo wants you (as in, everyone ) to know that it was not made using generative AI. \"I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI. HELLO,\" Mielgo wrote on Instagram (via Kotaku ). \"Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with [a] huge team—155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.\" I don't know where the AI allegations are coming from, to be honest: There's nothing in the comments on YouTube (or at least nothing that isn't buried so deeply as to be irrelevant), nor have I run across anything on Reddit.

Gus Owen, creator of web game TimeGuessr (it's like GeoGuessr, but you're guessing both the location and year a photo was taken), had an idea: Make a Downdetector for Downdetector. Downdetector's Downdetector , as Owen called it, tells you whether or not Downdetector is down.

Think you could identify them, too? If I showed you just an X or a B or a Q, could you tell me what game title it was from? That's today's quiz, and we're going through the entire alphabet, A-Z. I'll show you 26 letters I painstaking cut out of game logos, and you type in the game name. (Feel free to use hints if you get stuck.)

Most players run into a quest early on where you need to heal a goose, but failing it causes the goose to transform into a demon known as Maniacal Goose. Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into. But there's an achievement involved for killing it and we all know that's gamer kryptonite. As players of the new game wrestled with the demon goose and the other geese you can find hanging out in the open world, a strategy formed: throw them into the water and let nature take care of it.

The fact that it cost $15 didn't help, and most players at the time were mourning Hopoo's exit and what they saw as a naked attempt to cash in. Things are going a bit better this time. While also costing $15—nearly two-thirds the price of the base game— Alloyed Collective adds a whole lot to the game, including two new characters, seven stages with new music tracks, and a new final boss. More importantly, it doesn't seem to be breaking fundamental game systems like physics and how damage is calculated.

When the pandemic initially sent entire corporate industries home, there was a flurry of experimentation in using games not just as hangout spaces, but online meeting rooms too. Some people even had meetings in Red Dead Online. That energy for makeshift avatar office culture didn't really last, and I've felt a lingering loneliness in working from home even though I prefer it to a commute. Trends like body-doubling haven't caught my interest, but what has grabbed me by the throat and not let go is an adorable \"cozy multiplayer productivity game\" called On-Together that's made my work week 100% more social and more productive. Imagine turning Animal Crossing into a coworking space—that's basically On-Together. It's unabashedly cozy game-core with chibi avatars, a pastel color palette, and little minigames like fishing and basketball.

Yet, here we are. The film, as reported by Deadline , is being developed by Anton, the production group behind the 2020 film Greenland , and writers Cory Todd Hughes and Adrian Speckert. Hughes and Speckert don't have any screenplays about being chained together a la Chained Together on their resumes yet, but they have worked on another videogame adaptation: the upcoming Finding Frankie film, the source material for which looks to be one of those not-quite-Five Nights at Freddy's-type games littered about Steam. It's an odd choice for an adaptation. Chained Together doesn't strike me as a narratively inclined game, but then again, neither do Minecraft , Outrun , or Rampage .

The lone negative review for Omelet You Cook isn't actually negative, though. \"Game is amazing,\" writes the reviewer. \"I just like to be different.\" Look, I've seen plenty of joke negative reviews on Steam before, often along the lines of \"Why are you searching for negative reviews?

As cliché as it sounds, the results will surprise you. Firstly, my beloved Stitcher is the most efficient of the bunch, wringing out 13,700 damage/1950 shots per full repair at level 4, which works out to just two credits per shot.

Dailian quotes a Samsung report claiming, \"the 2nm first-generation gate-all-around (GAA) process has improved performance by 5%, power efficiency by 8%, and area by 5% compared to the 3nm second-generation process.\" At first glance, those are not exactly mind blowing advances. For context, it's worth noting that comparing nodes between companies is awfully tricky. Superficially, you might expect Samsung's new 2 nm node, also known as SF2, to be broadly comparable to TSMC's upcoming N2 technology, which has yet to be seen in a chip you can actually buy but is also ostensibly a 2 nm-class node. On paper, you'd also throw Intel's 18A node into the same category. Again, Intel's 18A isn't out yet but is due any day now. In practice, it's way more complicated than that.

That puts it halfway to matching its predecessor's lifetime sales, including the sales of its well-received expanded edition, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side.

For $269 ( direct from Thermal Grizzly ), you can have one as well, though let's be honest here: the Der8enchtable is going to be of zero use to the vast majority of PC enthusiasts. That's because it's simply an open-platform circuit board that you can connect a motherboard to, and separately control fans, pumps, and lights; it also provides external storage options so you don't have to use those on the motherboard. It might be a bit 'inside baseball' but let me explain why this is so useful for hardware testing.

Broadly speaking, it's an effort to catch up with Nvidia's equivalent DLSS technologies, which have been ahead of AMD's curve when it comes to the use of machine learning in general, along with some specific capabilities that AMD lacks. The headline enhancement is more fully leveraging machine learning for upscaling, which is why, as we understand it and as the new AMD teaser trailer implies, Redstone will be tied to AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT . Only the latest AMD graphics architecture has sufficient hardware matrix math ability to run the AI code. Or so the story likely goes, anyway. Slightly confusingly, AMD has also said that Redstone can run on Nvidia GPUs on account of being developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code).

Hell, you could even just surrender if the map gives you a bad spawn point necessitating a giant trek across the map, if you're eager to get this quest done speedily. However you approach it, here's how to complete Back on Top and where to find each building to mark. On Dam Battlegrounds, mark the Pattern House You can find the Pattern House in north Dam Battlegrounds (Image credit: Embark Studios) This first one is easy. Simply load into Dam Battlegrounds and head to the Pattern House in the north of the map, north of the Generator Hall and the Power Generation Complex, east of West Broken Bridge. You can interact to mark any of the walls around the bottom of the building (Image credit: Embark Studios) Once you get there, yo…",

OK, these days they're probably more likely to be on-board with the superb sequel , but still. With that 20th anniversary in mind, developer ArenaNet has announced the most substantial overhaul in the game's history: December 3 will see the launch of Guild Wars Reforged , a visual and gameplay overhaul for the venerable monster-bothering quest-em-up. Reforged is co-developed by ArenaNet and new studio 2weeks, which is largely composed of former ArenaNet staff, and bills itself as a modernised version of the game and its (many) expansions. The visuals have had an HD overhaul, performance has been tweaked, the UI has been reworked, there's a new (optional) objective guide, and Reforged also boasts proper controller support and Steam Deck optimisation. The overhaul will be free for existing owners of the game, but will also lower the price point to $20 for the game's complete package for anyone who wants to dive in fresh.

Yes, I had to look it up. In the case of the former, this rare earth element is vital for a number of engineering processes, including semiconductor manufacturing—and as a result of an export-related supply shortage, prices have risen from $8 per kilogram at the end of last year to $126 per kg in 2025 (via Bloomberg ). While US president Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping late last month resulted in a pause on some of its rare earth restrictions, earlier global controls outlined in April of this year are still in place. These restrictions require companies to obtain licenses from Beijing before exporting rare earth materials out of the country, and the approvals granted to date are said to be for small shipments only . That's a serious issue for the global manufacturing supply chain, as China is estimated to control roughly 69% of rare earth mining , and refines nearly all of the yttrium currently available.
