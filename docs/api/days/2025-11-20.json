The rare, price-cutting deals begin on November 20, 2025, and run through Cyber Monday, offering meaningful discounts across the company’s lineup and giving shoppers ample time to secure a digital notebook before the holiday rush. This year’s promotion includes two separate deals. The first is a $70 discount on all reMarkable 2 bundles, the brand’s crowd-pleasing classic. The reMarkable 2 stays popular because it’s slim, simple, and nails the paper-and-pen-like experience better than many e-ink competitors. The second deal is a $50 discount on all reMarkable Paper Pro bundles, giving the larger, more powerful model a friendlier price tag.

The X-59, designed to fly at supersonic speeds and reduce the sound of loud sonic booms to quieter sonic thumps, took off at 11:14 a.m. EDT and flew for 67 minutes. The flight represents a major step toward quiet supersonic flight over land. “Once again, NASA and America are leading the way for the future of flight,” said acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. “The X-59 is the first of its kind, and a major breakthrough in America’s push toward commercial air travel that’s both quiet and faster than ever before.

    "body": "كتب نادي الهلال كلمة النهاية في صفقة التعاقد مع سلطان مندش، جناح فريق التعاون، خلال فترة الانتقالات الشتوية المقبلة، وفقًا لما كشفت عنه تقارير صحفية. وارتبط اسم الهلال بالتعاقد مع الجناح السعودي خلال فترة الانتقالات الشتوية المقبلة، في ظل المستويات المميزة التي قدمها مع نادي التعاون منذ بداية الموسم الحالي. وقالت صحيفة \" اليوم \" السعودية، إن نادي التعاون أبلغ الهلال بشكل رسمي عدم رغبته في التخلي عن سلطان مندش خلال فترة الانتقالات الشتوية المقبلة. وأكد التعاون أن اللاعب الدولي السعودي سيبقى مع الفريق حتى نهاية الموسم على أقل تقدير، في ظل رغبة النادي في الحفاظ على استقراره، والنتائج المميزة التي يقدمها في الفترة الحالية. ويحتل التعاون المركز الثاني في جدول ترتيب الدوري السعودي، برصيد 21 نقطة، حصدها من 7 انتصارات متتالية، بعد هزيمة وحيدة، كانت على يد النصر الذي يتصدر جدول الترتيب بفارق 3 نقاط. وأوضحت الصحيفة أن قرار التعاون دفع الهلال لتعليق صفقة سلطان مندش في الوقت الحالي، حيث بدأ يدرس الخيارات البديلة المُتاحة للتعاقد مع أحدها خلال فترة الانتقالات الشتوية المقبلة. موقف شاموسكا وجاء قرار التعاون بناء على طلب من البرازيلي بريكليس شاموسكا، المدير الفني للفريق، والذي أكد في تصريحات تلفزيونية سابقة رغبته في بقاء مندش حتى نهاية الموسم على أقل تقدير. وقال شاموسكا في تصريحات تلفزيونية سابق…",

    "body": "يؤمن روبن أموريم، مدرب مانشستر يونايتد، بأن التصريح العلني الذي أدلى به السير جيم راتكليف لدعمه، كان له التأثير الضخم على موسم الشياطين الحمر حتى الآن. وقال الشريك المالك في \"أولد ترافورد\" خلال فترة التوقف الدولي في أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول، إن المدرب البرتغالي يجب أن يتم الحكم على عمله بعد ثلاث سنوات، لا بعد بضعة أشهر من العمل، وأن المشروع يتطلب الصبر والاستمرارية. ومع أن أموريم لم يُكمل سوى عام واحد فقط من تلك المدة – حيث تحلّ ذكرى أول مباراة له في القيادة يوم الإثنين المقبل – فإن التصريحات القوية لراتكليف جعلت الأجواء حول النادي أكثر هدوءا واستقرارا، بعد أسابيع كانت فيها الضغوط في أعلى مستوياتها، خصوصا عقب الخسارة 3-1 أمام برينتفورد في نهاية سبتمبر/ أيلول. ومنذ تلك الهزيمة، استجمع الفريق قواه وحقق صحوة واضحة، إذ فاز في ثلاث مباريات وتعادل في اثنتين، ما منح المدرب البرتغالي بعض المساحة لإعادة ترتيب أوراقه وتثبيت خطواته داخل النادي. ويعتقد أموريم أن كلمات راتكليف خلال الشهر الماضي لعبت دورا محوريا في تهدئة الضوضاء المحيطة بالنادي. وقال أموريم، في تصريحات نقلتها \"ذا صن\": \"إذا تذكرتم اللحظة التي أجرى فيها جيم تلك المقابلة، ستدركون كيف هدّأت كثيرا مما كان يدور حول النادي. تغيّر الضجيج تماما، وكان لذلك أهمية كبيرة للفريق، كما أنه مهم جدا بالنسبة لي أيضا\". وأضاف: \"لقد كان تأثيرها هائلا، لي…",

Google knows that smartphones don’t exist in a world by themselves, and over the years the company’s shown its willingness to promote both Android itself and Pixel devices with the help of some timely media tie-ins. Maybe that means showing off its AR tech with some help from The Mandalorian, or using the cameras on Pixel phones to record the highlights from the NBA All-Star Weekend. Right now, Google is all about the new “Wicked” movie, coming to theaters this Friday, and its latest promotional effort is a profoundly weird Pixel animation.

    "body": "TL;DR The Abxylute 3D One is a new gaming handheld with an 11-inch glasses-free 3D screen. It uses instant AI 2D-to-3D conversion for movies, photos, and retro games, plus native 3D in supported games and media. The Kickstarter is now live, with early-bird pricing starting at $1,499. The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses. It was first teased as the “ Sunday Dragon ” at CES 2025, where it was billed as a prototype collaboration between Intel and Tencent before Abxylute picked up the design.",

In fact, Google’s testing indicates that the new model beats OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 in almost every single AI intelligence benchmark. It’s also vastly better at coding as my colleague Mishaal showcased by building entire Android apps in little time.",

The two biggest flavors, Google’s Material 3 Expressive and One UI 8, couldn’t be more different. Samsung overhauled its operating system with One UI 7, opting for a subtle and iOS-like appearance that extends into One UI 8 . Meanwhile, Google doubled down on Material You, releasing Material 3 Expressive as part of Android 16 for Pixel phones, tablets, and watches. One is minimalist, the other maximalist.

Those big windows-slash-doors bring a level of luminosity we’d never experienced in our previous rental, especially during the gloomy winter months, but we soon discovered that they also had a potential disadvantage: insulation. Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment.

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new split-screen functionality for Gemini. This would allow Gemini to read the contents of other apps open in split-screen mode without an overlay or Gemini Live. The feature may be limited to book-style foldabes or tablets. Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini overlays have been two remarkable ways to let Gemini view content from other apps. But their application remains limited since the overlay closes as soon as we switch back to the other app. The other alternative is to share your screen with Gemini Live , but that may not match the regular interface in terms of functionality. Now, Google may be working to partially solve that by allowing Gemini to interpret another app’s content, though the application may be limited to a specific set of devices.

He says while the agreement between Rebble and Core includes a licensing fee of $0.20 per user per month, Rebble assert a 100% claim on its app store data. He counter-accused Pebble of “attempting to create a walled garden around 13,000 apps and faces that individual Pebble developers created and uploaded to the Pebble Appstore between 2012 and 2016,” and added he’s “working hard to keep the Pebble ecosystem open source.”",

The holidays bring time off work and connection with friends and family, but they also come with travel, traffic, and plenty of errands. Thanksgiving is the most-traveled holiday in the US, with over 80 million people expected to hit the roads, board trains, and fly on planes this coming week. After that, December holidays lead right into the new year. To help you ace your holiday travel and preparations, Google is sharing a few tips based on Google Maps data to save you time while avoiding traffic. Thanksgiving is first, so let’s start there. Traffic is 14% more congested than usual between 10 AM and 4 PM the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which falls on November 27 this year. You should try to avoid traveling on that Wednesday between 1 PM and 3 PM, since that two-hour window is when roads are most crow…",

The Translate app may gain a persistent notification, allowing you to continue using Live Translate even if you switch to a different app. Google also appears to be prepping for Live Translate on XR glasses. In August, Google rolled out an update to the Translate app that introduced Live Translation. Powered by Gemini, this feature allows you to have a real-time back-and-forth conversation with others in a different language. Not only are your words converted into another language on screen, but you can also turn on audio playback to hear the translation spoken out loud. In our APK teardown of the Google Translate app, we discovered that several interesting changes are likely to be introduced to this Live Translate feature.

Google parent company Alphabet’s stock price has doubled this year as Google has built out AI efforts. The breakneck pace of investment in companies developing AI tech over the past few years has many onlookers convinced we’re currently in an AI bubble. Sundar Pichai knows the situation is serious: when the AI bubble bursts, “no company is going to be immune,” the Google CEO told the BBC . In an interview with the BBC at Google’s headquarters in California, Pichai drew parallels between today’s AI market and the 1990s dot-com boom, during which investment in internet startups reached a fever pitch before a crash saw tech firms lose trillions in market cap and shed tens of thousands of jobs. Back then, “There was clearly a lot of excess investment,” Pichai said, “but none of us would question whether the internet was profound.” Pichai said AI investment is in a similar spot today.",

The tech lives in a tiny earring back called the Lumia Core, which attaches to Lumia’s own jewelry or your existing earrings. Pricing starts at $249 for the device, plus $9.99/month for a membership. Smart rings may be one of the trendiest fitness tracking form factors of the moment, but one company is making the case that health tracking belongs on your ear. Lumia today announced Lumia 2, a smart earring that tracks blood flow to your head in real time. According to the company, the device offers insight into energy, focus, and mental clarity. It’s a bold pitch for what Lumia calls the “world’s first smart earrings,” but it’s also one built on clinical roots rather than consumer fashion. Lumia originally developed its sensing tech alongside researchers at Johns Hopkins, Duke, and Harvard to help patients with chronic blood-flow disorders. Now, the company wants to make that same technology more accessible by packaging it inside a jewelry-like earring back it calls the Lumia Core. The Core houses an optical sensor and other health senso…",

If you want to go a step further, lock your phone away. The advice always sounds great until you actually try living with it. For one, my job relies on technology and communication, and I can’t exactly turn off the dial on that. Moreover, most of us cannot simply retreat from the world. We need maps, banking, authentication , messaging, and the small conveniences that make everyday life function smoothly. That tension between wanting less and needing enough is where most of these experiments fall apart. At least they do for me.

DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",

Chosun Biz (via Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that the Exynos 2600-equipped Galaxy S26 will primarily be sold in Asia, including Korea. This comes after ET News reported last week that the S26 and S26 Plus will receive Exynos power in Korea and Europe, but Snapdragon silicon in North America. ET News added that the S26 Ultra will be equipped with a Snapdragon chip globally.",
