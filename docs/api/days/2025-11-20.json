Called Chrono Divide , it released in pre-alpha in October 2020, and has continually received updates through this year. While you might expect it to be a solo novelty, it's actually got its own leaderboard, boasts cross-platform play with Android and iPhone users, and even has limited mod support. It's all being maintained by solo developer usestrict, who goes by El Presidente on the project Discord. As the fan game's website notes, \"the project initially started out as an experiment and was meant to prove that it was possible to have a fully working, cross-platform RTS game running in a web browser. Now, with a playable version already available, the end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla 'Red Alert 2' engine.\" After importing my Red Alert 2 files and futzing around with it for a minute, it certainly seem…",

How about more 2D pixel art, but this time in first person ? \"Turbo wildcard\" Vampire Crawlers, a spin-off coming next year, reinterprets the characters, enemies and items of Vampire Survivors into a deckbuilding dungeon crawler. \"It’s about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer,\" Poncle founder Luca told Xbox Wire in an interview ahead of the announcement. Shortly after the success of Vampire Survivors, Luca \"was already thinking of getting in touch with other indie studios to start working on spin-offs,\" so the idea behind Vampire Crawlers has been gestating for about four years. He suggests it's just one of many prototypes they've had in development, but the marriage of Vampire Survivors' spiraling chaos and a first-person roguelike just worked immediately. \"To some people this game will look like a 'blobber', a half-unknown genre that us…",

So when the new class turned out to be 'Hive Scum'—essentially just an archetypal criminal—the reaction was, predictably, disappointment. \"We could have had a tech priest, but instead we get someone I've probably seen milling around in the centre of Manchester drunk at 2 in the afternoon,\" says one comment on the trailer on YouTube . \"Out of all the 40k options they picked this?\" says another, echoing a common sentiment. The main subreddit is full of similar comments , from \"this is like going to your baby reveal and finding out you're also not the father level of disappointment\" to \"lazy and boring choice for new class\".

The unfilmed scene was originally intended to be a part of Kill Bill Volume 1, and is called The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge. It was announced by no less than director Quentin Tarantino and star Uma Thurman at a Fortnite event hosted at the Vista Theater in Hollywood, California (owned by one, erm, Q. Tarantino). Tarantino has previously spoken about elements of the films that were left on the cutting room floor, with Yuki's Revenge being removed for pacing reasons.

MrBeast, or Jimmy Donaldson, revealed the scope of attractions in Beast Land (and the game-oriented in-park land Beast Zone) earlier this month in a thread on X . The games on offer include Drop Zone, where players aim to be the last person standing atop a series of trap doors, and Airmail, where players drop a \"weighted bag\" from a zipline onto a target below. As reported by Kotaku , the park also features thrill rides, photo-op set pieces where you can pretend to hold Feastables with MrBeast himself, a seemingly endless spew of branded merchandise, and a stash of 1 million Saudi Riyal, or roughly $266,000 USD, which will go to the highest scoring Arena players.

Facepunch considered changing its stance in 2022 when the Steam Deck launched, but didn't end up introducing official Proton support.

The problem being, these combat mods are often used for things other than raw, sweaty, glorious DPS and efficiency. For example, cleaning up visual noise and making the game more accessible. Or, in some cases, just customising superficial elements of the UI to your liking—whether to combat colour blindness or for the aesthetic.

Button Stew is likely to pop up in your horse's favourite meals, especially Khan, so you'll want to check the recipe off your list as soon as possible. Even though it's only a two-star entree, it's not an easy dish to guess the ingredients for, and you have to venture a little out of the mountains if you want to batch cook some. How to make Button Stew in Disney Dreamlight Valley To cook Button Stew, you need to take the follow ingredients to a cooking pot either in Remy's Restaurant or outside of your house in Wishblossom Ranch: 1 x Button Mushroom 1 x Carrot If you're not planning on feeding your stew to your horse (or yourself) then you can sell it at Goofy's stall for 375 Star Coins.

The researchers claim to have scraped phone numbers, timestamps, \"about\" text, profile pictures, and public keys for E2EE encryption, the release of which, \"would entail adverse implications to the included users.\" So, what exactly is going on here and if you use WhatsApp do you need to be worried? This research relies on the fact that WhatsApp allows some user details to be acquired by inputting phone numbers. That includes the profile photos already mentioned. However, the key point is that users can opt to keep most of that data and profile images either entirely private or restricted to known contacts. Perhaps the only real surprise here is that the WhatsApp platform does not implement any explicit rate limits for querying phone numbers (at least it didn't before this research was conducte…",

Figuratively, since a trip to the Arctic is out of PC Gamer's budget, and I've only stuck some Arctic parts into a PC and called it a day. Less risk of hypothermia, though my components are perfectly chilly. The Arctic Xtender case is the star of the show here. The cooling company's first case and I dare say a good one. Confusingly for a company famed for its CPU coolers, it focuses on looks, rather than pure cooling ability. Needless to say, it looks absolutely superb under the heavily-tinted mirrored glass surrounding its fishtank-style exterior. It looks so good, in fact, I'm starting to question why I opted for a white build rather than this dashing, icy look. As for the rest, I've opted for an AMD Ryzen 7 9700X here, in combination with 32 GB of DDR5-6000 RAM from Corsair. Standard, but dependable.

It doesn't help that, while the game is free-to-play, it also has two tiers of monthly subscriptions available. The cheapest offers basic functionalities like trading and auction house usage, which aren't available if you're playing for free.

Welcome tweaks, of course, but no real swings at specific weapons and items. And that's not completely unwarranted, as I'd say most guns are pretty well-balanced right now. But while everyone's been singing the praises of the Anvil as a weapon that shoots far above its weight, the Venator has been the sleeper pick all along for PvP. Firing two shots at once, this rare pistol was capable of dropping other players blazingly fast. It was only a matter of time until the reaper came knocking, and that day is today with the 1.3.0 patch notes . In short, the Venator has had its incrementally upgraded fire rate reduced from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%, and its weight from 2kg to 5kg. Embark explains in the patch notes that it's \"re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact.\" \"This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the w…",

Since you have to extract both of Celeste's Journal items in one round, you may as well bring a free loadout , since a safe pocket isn't going to do you much good when you can only extract one of them anyway (unless you want to risk an augment with multiple safe pockets, I suppose).

Overall, Nvidia raked in $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025 . That's 62% up on the same quarter in 2024 and 22% up on Q2 2025. It was enough to have CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang comment, \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.\" Reflecting the importance of Nvidia not just to the ongoing AI boom but the entire global economy, markets across the world rallied in response to Nvidia's record earnings. Nvidia's own share price went up, too, inevitably. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia's current share price of around $196 in after hours trading is still well down on its October peak of $212, perhaps reflecting that even these new and impressive results aren't enough to entirely erase concerns over a mooted AI bubble and what might happen if it bursts. As for the future, Nvidia is predicting even higher revenues. It has next quarter pencilled in at $65 billion and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress predicted another $350 billion in AI GPU sales between now and the end of 2026.…",

But, to my surprise, we've left the planet for a more galactic adventure this time around, though it won't be the farm life we're used to. That's right, Stardew Valley has teamed up with Among Us to bring a bundle of 29 themed cosmetics for your little avatar, so you no longer have to rely on the sprout hat. This package includes things like a Krobus and Junimo Pet, a Mayor Lewis outfit, and a Linius outfit, among many others which will let you cosplay as Abigail, Sebastian, and Mr Qi. No matter how rogue your favourite character is in Stardew, it seems Among Us have tried to create an outfit for everyone in their Cosmicube. For those who don't know what that means, a Cosmicube is basically a bundle of themed cosmetics which you can buy for in-game currency, which in this case is Beans. So there's no need to spend the day growing crops and fishing to be able to afford this one. You'll be able to spend your hard-earned cash as either an imposter or a crewmate, the only catch is you need to play these games to completion rather…",

Nvidia announced the deal on Tuesday , with its two partners making their own announcements simultaneously. Nvidia's post explains that as ChatGPT competitor Claude is being scaled up using Microsoft Azure—which itself uses Nvidia's hardware—it made sense for the three companies to enter into a more formal relationship. Hence, Anthropic is committing to buy up $30 billion worth of Azure compute capacity, while Microsoft has agreed to invest $5 billion back into Anthropic, and Nvidia will also offer up $10 billion to Claude's creator. It's almost more money than my bog-standard grey matter wants to compute. But back to silicon—Nvidia says it will also collaborate with Anthropic at a technical level. The company says the pair will co-ordinate \"on design and engineering, with the goal of optimizing Anthropic models for the best possible performance, efficiency and TCO, and optimizing future NVIDIA architectures for Anthropic workloads.\" Anthropic has committed to 1 gigawa…",

OK, I'll admit it: Arc Raiders can get a little boring when you're a pacifist. Casually waving hello to solo raiders as they loot the locker you were hoping to have to yourself is not as novel or fun the hundredth time it happens, especially after you've gotten good enough at eluding Arc patrols that even they're only rarely a threat. Last week, I went on three raids in a row without firing a shot. It's at this point that solo players looking to zest up their routine might turn to the dark side: picking fights out in the open, setting traps at extraction points, or the least forgivable 2012-ass DayZ behavior of all, shooting randos in the back after establishing a \"Don't shoot!\" truce. Banditry did cross my mind. PvP is pretty fun in Arc Raiders, after all, and after 43 hours I still haven't gotten to do very much of it . But I've come to value Arc Raiders' gentle culture so much (and judge every hostile player so harshly) that I can't become the hypocrite now. I'd sooner uninstall.

It's very sharp and stylish, and Mielgo wants you (as in, everyone ) to know that it was not made using generative AI. \"I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI. HELLO,\" Mielgo wrote on Instagram (via Kotaku ). \"Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with [a] huge team—155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.\" I don't know where the AI allegations are coming from, to be honest: There's nothing in the comments on YouTube (or at least nothing that isn't buried so deeply as to be irrelevant), nor have I run across anything on Reddit.

Gus Owen, creator of web game TimeGuessr (it's like GeoGuessr, but you're guessing both the location and year a photo was taken), had an idea: Make a Downdetector for Downdetector. Downdetector's Downdetector , as Owen called it, tells you whether or not Downdetector is down.

The art style and scenery and even the color palate of the games we play eventually get burned into our brains. But how about if I snipped a letter out of a game's stylized title? Think you could identify them, too? If I showed you just an X or a B or a Q, could you tell me what game title it was from? That's today's quiz, and we're going through the entire alphabet, A-Z. I'll show you 26 letters I painstaking cut out of game logos, and you type in the game name. (Feel free to use hints if you get stuck.)

Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into.

The fact that it cost $15 didn't help, and most players at the time were mourning Hopoo's exit and what they saw as a naked attempt to cash in. Things are going a bit better this time. While also costing $15—nearly two-thirds the price of the base game— Alloyed Collective adds a whole lot to the game, including two new characters, seven stages with new music tracks, and a new final boss. More importantly, it doesn't seem to be breaking fundamental game systems like physics and how damage is calculated. The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, at least among folks who've bought the DLC.

Just go play the game, it's great!\" But it's especially bold to post a negative review that breaks that lovely 100% positive streak that's been rolling along for months—just for a joke. I tip my cap. \"As I'm sure…",

The feature is now live, though voluntary, with the requirement for either \"Facial Age Estimation\" or ID verification becoming mandatory worldwide from December 2025 to January 2026. Users who do not wish to use chat features do not have to complete an age check. \"Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become Trusted Connections with people they know,\" says the Roblox announcement .

The whole thing began innocently enough—or at least so it appeared. Keighley, host of The Game Awards, posted a message on X urging his followers to \"Check out #TheGameAwards nominee page on Steam to celebrate the best of the year.\" He attached an image of the Steam front page, which—because he was logged in at the time—revealed that he has precisely one game in his wishlist. (Image credit: Geoff Keighley (Twitter)) This did not go unnoticed by the ever-sharp Wario64 (via GamesRadar ), who asked, \"What's the one game you have wishlisted?\" Dozens of people shared their theories, and there were many and varied thoughts, but one overarching theme shone through: pic.twitter.com/iQgOlqRPYG November 17, 2025 Keighley himself really set things off, though, with his googly-eyes emoji response: A flood of hope and cope followed from people w…",

Now, it's hired the former narrative lead of Cloud Chamber Games, the developer that's currently working on BioShock 4 . Liz Albl joined CD Projekt last month in the role of senior writer on Cyberpunk 2 . Prior to this, she spent almost three years as narrative lead at Cloud Chamber Games working on BioShock 4, with her other credits including Ghost of Tsushima , Watch Dogs: Legion , and just over a year working on Monolith's cancelled Wonder Woman game . As spotted by IGN , Albl left Cloud Chamber in August—around the time the developer laid off staff after BioShock 4 failed an internal review , with its narrative criticised by 2K's executives in particular as the publisher committed to a development overhaul. BioShock 4 had already been in development for a decade before the review, with 2K announcing it was in production six years ago. The overhaul resulted in the removal of studio head Kelley Gilmore and creative …",

Simply put, I like the way the Stitcher, Ferro, and Anvil feel compared to competition like the Kettle, Arpeggio, and Torrente, among others. And that's lucky for me now that I've seen the maths behind it all. Content creator ' Min Max Lab ', who's been doing a bunch of excellent Arc Raiders science experiments lately, has worked out the efficiency of the most common and popular weapons by weighing up their max durability, how much is lost per shot, and how expensive each one is to repair. As cliché as it sounds, the results will surprise you. Firstly, my beloved Stitcher is the most efficient of the bunch, wringing out 13,700 damage/1950 shots per full repair at level 4, which works out to just two credits per shot. This demolishes the Rattler IV's average 11,900 damage per gun at 3.9 credits per shot. There's a noticeab…",

If you're letting players pilot ships, you're kind of obliged to give them somewhere to go in them and something to do in them. Jagex adjures you to find \"new adventures and NPCs,\" to deal with \"new threats and face monsters from both the sea and the skies,\" and to \"Max out the brand-new Sailing Skill and earn ship upgrades with each new level.\" Also, \"Get to know the Tortugan species on The Great Conch Island.\" Which sounds quite pleasant.
