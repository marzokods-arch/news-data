We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. It's one of the basic natural laws of videogames: get too many NPCs together in the same place, and they will start forming factions. Whether you're doing quests for them, joining them, fighting them, or grinding reputation to get that one rare armour set you can't live without, factions are often key to your experience with a game. What would Skyrim be without inexplicably becoming the head of four different guilds? What would you do in Destiny if you didn't have a bunch of conveniently compartmentalised aliens to go shoot at? Would it even be possible to enjoy XCOM without a global coalition judging your performance after every mission? (Image credit: Bethesda) So, we've established that factions are important. The next question is, how well do you remember them? Can you identify, from just a screenshot of one or more NPCs from a particular faction, what their collective is named?

The most notable example is Jonathan Blow's maze-obsessed puzzler The Witness , which distressingly will be a decade old come January. Now though, veteran publisher MicroProse has just released Neyyah . That may read like onomatopoeia for the noise Minecraft villagers make, but it is in fact a first-person 3D point 'n' click puzzler, one that doesn't so much wear its Myst inspirations on its sleeve as have them tattooed all over its body. Created over seven years by solo developer Adam Gwynaire, Neyyah transports players to not one but several remote islands dotted with strange plant life and mysterious structures. Like Myst, it's a first-person point and click adventure that involves reactivating arcane machinery by solving puzzles that interconnect in obscure ways. There's a trailer for the game below. The 3D environments certainly look the part, though I'm less sold on the FMV cutscenes used to tell the story, which have a (somewhat endearing, in all fairness) am-dram quality about them.

Just four months on from the Biogenesis addon , which built out the 4X's bioengineering pathways, the Shadows of the Shroud DLC will expand the minds of psionic players on September 22. According to Paradox, Shadows of the Shroud offers a \"complete overhaul\" of Stellaris' Psionic Ascension path. Through this, your civilization taps its telepathic potential to commune with an extra-universal realm known as the Shroud, potentially forming a covenant with one of the cosmic divine beings—known as \"patrons\"—residing within. Shadows of the Shroud delineates this process into three key stages: preparing to pierce the veil, communing with the Patrons, then choosing one to ally with and reaping the rewards/suffering the consequences. As part of this, the DLC adds a new \"Shroud Panel\", helping visualise how attuned you are to the Shroud and specific patrons within it. This should make it easier to see precisely what path you're on, and the rewards (and risks) your chosen direction leads to.

As skilled as we are at following checklists of things to collect and arrows that point us to our precise destination, sometimes a shiny object in the distance catches our eye and lures us away from our destiny as the one true savior of the realm. Sometimes, instead of staying devoted to our highest purpose as videogame enthusiasts—typing the words \"Half-Life 3?\" into the Twitch or YouTube chat box during any and every livestreamed event—we get distracted. Hollow Knight: Silksong was very distracting. Announced, then vanished, then resurfaced and re-vanished in such a way as to inspire waves of hope, despair and development hell conspiracy theories. Half-Life 3 had to earn its place as the mystical ur-announcement, the unlikeliest of hoped-for \"One last thing\" bombshells to trot out at the end of a Game Awards or E3 keynote, by not existing for decades. Silksong took a mere five years to run the same cycle. And the whole time it was a real game! That realness made the possibility of Silksong popping up in every single Nintendo Direct, Gamescom Opening Night Live, or Sony State of Play seem so tantalizingly possible. …",

Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio said a few years ago that he really did not want to call it Prey , and it turns out he was not alone on that: Former Bethesda marketing and communications boss Pete Hines said in an interview with Dbltap that he was dead-set against it too. \"I definitely pissed some people off internally over that because I fought so hard against using that name,\" Hines said. \"I'm the head of the spear, but I had a lot of people across my team—brand, PR and community—and we feel like we're burdening it with a name where we spend more time explaining why it's called Prey than we do talking about the game.\" The reason for all that time spent explaining, as previously noted, is that the whole thing was so odd. Prey—the original—was developed by Human Head Studios and released in 2006, and it was quite good. A sequel was planned, although it was more of a spinoff, following the adventures of a completely different character in a completely different setting: A great ci…",

Like a lot of things in the game, you're not explicitly told how to complete the quest. And if you don't figure it out, you'll have no way out of the area. This particular quest can be frustrating because there's a trick to it that you might only stumble upon by accident. The Seamstress isn't all that helpful when she asks you to find bugs that \"produce a marvelous spine, flexible yet strong.\" I don't know about you, but I've already found quite a lot of spine-like things in the game that are flexible and strong. It would've saved me a lot of time if the Seamstress, I don't know, narrowed it down a little. Turns out, there's one particular type of enemy that drops the Spine Cores you need to finish her quest. They're called Hokers and you've probably passed by a few in the area. They're round little guys who spit out spikes when you hit them. There are a bunch of them just to the right of the Seamstress' hut. All you have to do is slash them once, wait for them to shoot their spines out, and then hit each spine to pick them up as Spine Cores. …",

Silksong was less an upcoming game than it was a singularity of attention, continually accreting interest while emitting nothing back. And now it's out. You can play it. There are bugs in it and you can fight them. After spending so much time experiencing the wait for Silksong as a shared fever dream, it only felt right for those of us playing it to pool our initial reactions in a collected package: Does it meet the expectations of our Hollow Knight diehards? What does it do for those of us who didn't play the original? How does it feel to play something that you were never entirely sure existed? Are the bugs cool? Silksong, after six years, is here.

A medieval horror game with delightfully wonky controls Release date August 27, 2025 Expect to pay £9.99/ $11.99 Developer WildArts Games Publisher Black Lantern Collective Reviewed on RX 9070 XT, Intel Core i5 12600K, 32GB RAM Multiplayer No Steam Deck Not verified Link Steam First-person horror game Caput Mortum is another reminder that \"good\" controls won't necessarily improve a game. Mouselook or dual analogue control mods can sometimes make a classic more approachable, but other times it's like you used AI to \"improve\" the Mona Lisa or something. Caput Mortum gets this, and makes the controls one of your primary enemies, elevating a pretty good horror game to a truly memorable one. Caput Mortum's idiosyncratic controls, partly lifted from King's Field, FromSoftware's pre-Dark Souls first-person dungeon crawlers, had me hooting from the start. It's a \"we were still figuring out first-person on gamepad\" sort of deal: You look left and right with the triggers and up and down with the bumpers, swiveling your head like you're dialing in a WW2 anti-aircraft gun. The right analog stick is freed up for controlling your character's hand to manipulate objects i…",

All you need to do is head back to Bone Bottom, jump up the platforms marked with gold rings on the right side of the town and hit the ring tied to the post in Shakra's usual spot two times . This will make Shakra return, where she'll offer you whatever map you somehow managed to miss. Similar to Cornifer in Hollow Knight, Shakra is on her own journey through Pharloom, so she can jump around to new locations when you hit certain progression points or enter new areas, making it tricky if you miss her in one place and accidentally stumble into an entirely new region on your wanderi…",

Musk sees himself as an outsider and heroic figure taking on the status quo, despite being the world's richest man, the owner of X, and a sometimes-ally of Donald Trump. When Musk rails against 'the establishment', it's only when it threatens his vast fortune, his ability to indulge in hate speech, or when he's promoting conspiracies. Indeed, he posted multiple tweets during the Covid-19 lockdowns where he drew connections between essential measures to protect the vulnerable and the plot of Deux Ex, where a man-made pandemic is deployed by the world's richest man to advance a political power play. Unsurprisingly, Austin Grossman, who wrote Deus Ex alongside Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, is not a fan of Musk's take on the classic cyberpunk immersive sim. Deus Ex—and Dishonored, which Grossman also wrote—is a game very much interested in the powerful, and the tools they use to control people. It's also an exploration of the ethics of transhumanism—an industry that Musk himself is extremely invested in. \"That kind of pol…",

No, the LCD-S20 is for sitting back and engrossing yourself in your favourite game or album and enjoying the tonal brilliance of planar magnetic drivers. Marketed at professional musicians and producers, the LCD-S20 are a little out of our usual comfort zone for PC gaming apparel. However, what makes them great for recording a track in a studio also has a benefit for PC gaming. Namely, planar magnetic drivers with SLAM technology and superb sound isolation. The LCD-S20 look a lot like the Audeze Maxwell . That's a pair of headphones that we rate very highly, with multiple members of the PCG hardware team using them as their daily driver, and I'll get back to comparisons with these later in the review.

Maybe it was the promise of anime models that looked like they'd been ripped out of a 2000s online rhythm game or sheer summer boredom, but I'm glad my silly little brain made that decision. Everybody's Golf is an excellent game, and I loved the 2017 version's open courses that I could drive a cart around with my own wee custom character. Also, you know, the actual golfing part was surprisingly good with tight physics and a steep but fairly intuitive learning curve. (Image credit: Bandai Namco) It's why I was especially excited to discover that the series was going to be making its PC debut with Everybody's Golf Hot Shots. It's exclusively been a PlayStation thing since the first game released in 1997—except for the one game that made its way to mobile in Japan.

But now it's even worse. With the power of AI™ (not actually ™) we've successfully made the internet much worse for everyone, with social media, website comments sections, your email, various of your news outlets, even your YouTube videos now potentially being produced by a gaggle of hallucinating graphics cards. There's even the dead internet theory , the suggestion that—at this point—the internet is for the most part just a load of bots regurgitating content at each other. It's probably not true, to be clear. At least not yet. But you'll never guess who's started taking the idea a little more seriously: none other than OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who took to X this week to announce that he \"never took the dead internet theory that seriously,\" but that these days \"it seems like there are really a lot of LLM-run twitter accounts.\" PC Gamer's sources were una…",

As things currently stand, OpenAI uses large-scale computer systems with Nvidia chips for AI model training and inference.

Now, though, with AI becoming increasingly able to beat Turing tests and the likes, it's increasingly important to be able to verify whether someone online is a person or a bot. So, lest we head towards a vindication of the dead internet theory , we also need increasingly more accurate methods for distinguishing neurons from silicon. This is no less true for gaming than anywhere else. Players using bots to cheat in online games is a real problem , and as AI gets more sophisticated, we can only assume the problem will get worse. Anti-cheats tackle this issue from one angle—checking program executables and so on—but another way of tackling it is to check that a user is a live person, a method that is often called 'liveness detection' or 'proof-of-human'.

As explained in a Microsoft blog , the version that's just been released on GitHub was created for computers using MOS Technology 6502 processors (via The Register ). The Intel 8080 and MOS 6502 were both 8-bit CPUs, launched in 1974 and 1975, respectively.

We're in 'AAAAA' territory, gang; new heights of absurdity are here. That's per Nigel Lowrie, co-founder of Devolver Digital, in a chat with IGN . In a chat about Silksong and the mad scramble of devs to escape the orbit of its release date , Lowrie mentioned that there is, of course, an upcoming release even bigger, more enormous, more Brobdingnagian than Hornet and her needle: GTA 6. \"There are AAA games and then there's AAAA games,\" said Lowrie, \"and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game.\" That's quintuple-A, if they start blurring together at some point for you like they do for me. \"It's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands.\" Silksong might have loomed over other indie games, but GTA 6 hangs over anything you could conceivably call a videogame.

Sharing a near-identical name with Meta's CEO might seem to be a relatively innocuous thing, as does the fact that the aforementioned lawyer has been legitimately using Facebook to advertise his legal services. However, as explained in a short report from WHTR, Meta's moderation systems have apparently flagged such Facebook posts as being a false impersonation of the other Zuckerberg and promptly taken them down. The lawyer has, of course, paid fees for using a commercial Facebook page, but you never get them back if a post is removed.
