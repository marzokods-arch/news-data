A while back, I proclaimed that the old-school MMOs we all used to play are dead, and that we have killed them . I still mostly stand by that opinion, but I now have a major exception: The old sense of discovery, community, and mythology in these MMORPGs is alive and well in an air-pocket, deep under a sea of disseminated knowledge: It lives on in challenge running.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. It's one of the basic natural laws of videogames: get too many NPCs together in the same place, and they will start forming factions. Whether you're doing quests for them, joining them, fighting them, or grinding reputation to get that one rare armour set you can't live without, factions are often key to your experience with a game. What would Skyrim be without inexplicably becoming the head of four different guilds? What would you do in Destiny if you didn't have a bunch of conveniently compartmentalised aliens to go shoot at? Would it even be possible to enjoy XCOM without a global coalition judging your performance after every mission? (Image credit: Bethesda) So, we've established that factions are important. The next question is, how well do you remember them? Can you identify, from just a screenshot of one or more NPCs from a particular faction, what their collective is named?

Now though, veteran publisher MicroProse has just released Neyyah . That may read like onomatopoeia for the noise Minecraft villagers make, but it is in fact a first-person 3D point 'n' click puzzler, one that doesn't so much wear its Myst inspirations on its sleeve as have them tattooed all over its body. Created over seven years by solo developer Adam Gwynaire, Neyyah transports players to not one but several remote islands dotted with strange plant life and mysterious structures. Like Myst, it's a first-person point and click adventure that involves reactivating arcane machinery by solving puzzles that interconnect in obscure ways. There's a trailer for the game below. The 3D environments certainly look the part, though I'm less sold on the FMV cutscenes used to tell the story, which have a (somewhat endearing, in all fairness) am-dram quality about them.

According to Paradox, Shadows of the Shroud offers a \"complete overhaul\" of Stellaris' Psionic Ascension path. Through this, your civilization taps its telepathic potential to commune with an extra-universal realm known as the Shroud, potentially forming a covenant with one of the cosmic divine beings—known as \"patrons\"—residing within. Shadows of the Shroud delineates this process into three key stages: preparing to pierce the veil, communing with the Patrons, then choosing one to ally with and reaping the rewards/suffering the consequences. As part of this, the DLC adds a new \"Shroud Panel\", helping visualise how attuned you are to the Shroud and specific patrons within it. This should make it easier to see precisely what path you're on, and the rewards (and risks) your chosen direction leads to.

Fortunately, this will no longer be a problem as of next week. Tempest Rising's next update will bring several of the community's most hotly requested features. Among these is an active pause feature and a game speed adjustment tool designed specifically for the singleplayer campaign, letting you tweak the pace of the action to your liking, or freeze the game entirely while issuing orders to your units.

Like a lot of things in the game, you're not explicitly told how to complete the quest. And if you don't figure it out, you'll have no way out of the area. This particular quest can be frustrating because there's a trick to it that you might only stumble upon by accident. The Seamstress isn't all that helpful when she asks you to find bugs that \"produce a marvelous spine, flexible yet strong.\" I don't know about you, but I've already found quite a lot of spine-like things in the game that are flexible and strong. It would've saved me a lot of time if the Seamstress, I don't know, narrowed it down a little. Turns out, there's one particular type of enemy that drops the Spine Cores you need to finish her quest. They're called Hokers and you've probably passed by a few in the area. They're round little guys who spit out spikes when you hit them. There are a bunch of them just to the right of the Seamstress' hut. All you have to do is slash them once, wait for them to shoot their spines out, and then hit each spine to pick them up as Spine Cores. …",

What does it do for those of us who didn't play the original? How does it feel to play something that you were never entirely sure existed? Are the bugs cool? Silksong, after six years, is here. Here are our first thoughts. Team Cherry is hitting harder than ever—but maybe it could pull a punch or two?

Steven Spielberg is \" a big PC gamer \" and has multiple links to the games industry, not least his involvement in creating CoD's onetime inspiration Medal of Honor, and alongside Universal pitched his own vision for what a CoD movie could look like. Spielberg is apparently a big fan of the series, and obviously his name alone can get movies made, but that seems to have been the problem.

Mouselook or dual analogue control mods can sometimes make a classic more approachable, but other times it's like you used AI to \"improve\" the Mona Lisa or something. Caput Mortum gets this, and makes the controls one of your primary enemies, elevating a pretty good horror game to a truly memorable one. Caput Mortum's idiosyncratic controls, partly lifted from King's Field, FromSoftware's pre-Dark Souls first-person dungeon crawlers, had me hooting from the start. It's a \"we were still figuring out first-person on gamepad\" sort of deal: You look left and right with the triggers and up and down with the bumpers, swiveling your head like you're dialing in a WW2 anti-aircraft gun.

The good news is that if you miss a map in Silksong and fail to find resident cartographer Shakra in her new spot, then you can still get the map quite easily. All you need to do is head back to Bone Bottom, jump up the platforms marked with gold rings on the right side of the town and hit the ring tied to the post in Shakra's usual spot two times . This will make Shakra return, where she'll offer you whatever map you somehow managed to miss.

Musk sees himself as an outsider and heroic figure taking on the status quo, despite being the world's richest man, the owner of X, and a sometimes-ally of Donald Trump. When Musk rails against 'the establishment', it's only when it threatens his vast fortune, his ability to indulge in hate speech, or when he's promoting conspiracies. Indeed, he posted multiple tweets during the Covid-19 lockdowns where he drew connections between essential measures to protect the vulnerable and the plot of Deux Ex, where a man-made pandemic is deployed by the world's richest man to advance a political power play. Unsurprisingly, Austin Grossman, who wrote Deus Ex alongside Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, is not a fan of Musk's take on the classic cyberpunk immersive sim. Deus Ex—and Dishonored, which Grossman also wrote—is a game very much interested in the powerful, and the tools they use to control people. It's also an exploration of the ethics of transhumanism—an industry that Musk himself is extremely invested in. \"That kind of pol…",

No, the LCD-S20 is for sitting back and engrossing yourself in your favourite game or album and enjoying the tonal brilliance of planar magnetic drivers. Marketed at professional musicians and producers, the LCD-S20 are a little out of our usual comfort zone for PC gaming apparel. However, what makes them great for recording a track in a studio also has a benefit for PC gaming. Namely, planar magnetic drivers with SLAM technology and superb sound isolation. The LCD-S20 look a lot like the Audeze Maxwell . That's a pair of headphones that we rate very highly, with multiple members of the PCG hardware team using them as their daily driver, and I'll get back to comparisons with these later in the review.

Maybe it was the promise of anime models that looked like they'd been ripped out of a 2000s online rhythm game or sheer summer boredom, but I'm glad my silly little brain made that decision. Everybody's Golf is an excellent game, and I loved the 2017 version's open courses that I could drive a cart around with my own wee custom character. Also, you know, the actual golfing part was surprisingly good with tight physics and a steep but fairly intuitive learning curve. (Image credit: Bandai Namco) It's why I was especially excited to discover that the series was going to be making its PC debut with Everybody's Golf Hot Shots. It's exclusively been a PlayStation thing since the first game released in 1997—except for the one game that made its way to mobile in Japan.

Bethesda had promised swish, rugged, canvas things in the promo; when they arrived on players' doorsteps, they were made of cheap, easily damaged nylon. This took an entire year to fix , somehow. Whether you remember it or not, Pete Hines—former senior vice president of global marketing and communications at Bethesda—certainly does. In a chat with Dbltap , Hines recalled the whole episode, which he says he only learnt about when his own collector's edition hit his doorstep, like an old army guy remembering a particularly harrowing battle. \"My first reaction was, 'When the fuck did we add a canvas bag to this collector's edition?' Because the version I approved did not have one,\" said Hines, who attributes the inclusion of the bags to Bethesda \"trying to add more value\" to the whizzbang expensive edition of the game. Per Hines, adding more value to anything was a tough task. \"We were always fighting with the finance people about margins, right?

The publisher has announced that MGS Delta: Snake Eater surpassed a million sales across all platforms (PC, PS5, and Xbox) on its launch day. MGS Delta: Snake Eater launched on August 28, though was available a couple of days earlier for those who shelled out for the digital deluxe edition. PCG's review concluded that \"Delta answers the question it most needed to answer: Can Konami still make a great Metal Gear game? By most metrics I think this has aced it.\" The sales might be impressive but the launch hasn't gone completely to plan, with the game suffering some significant performance issues, particularly with frame drops. Konami has acknowledged the issues and says it's \"currently investigating the causes and working on a patch to resolve these problems\", but as yet there's no ETA. (Image credit: Konami) Nevertheless this shows what we all surely knew anyway: Metal Gear is still big business, even without series impresario Hideo Kojima. Konami seems pretty happy with itself too, saying in a press release that \"this achievement reflect…",

One thing I've seen repeated often in Borderlands 4's interviews is the insistence that yes, we've learned our lesson with Borderlands 3, and we're not going to give you a headache this time . We've got character motivations, stakes, and jokes not rooted in years-old memes! Which is fair enough. Borderlands 3's story ( which, warning, I will be spoiling ) was so atrocious it nearly spoiled what I otherwise found to be a great little game. I massively enjoyed zipping around as Zane with my movement speed build, and the moment-to-moment blasting was as consistent as ever. And then the story would happen and I'd start itching desperately to be shooting something again. It wasn't just the jokes, either. Borderlands 3 tripped over itself when it came to its serious moments, too. Maya's death, its insistence that Ava was the chosen one, Lilith throwing herself into a moon for some reason, any time the Calypso twins, who could've been 1,000% more interesting, were on screen—it wa…",

Somewhat surprisingly, though, this one is really old and just so happens to be a version of its first-ever software product. Specifically, it's a port of BASIC, the OS that founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed for use on the Intel 8080-powered Altair 8800 . As explained in a Microsoft blog , the version that's just been released on GitHub was created for computers using MOS Technology 6502 processors (via The Register ). The Intel 8080 and MOS 6502 were both 8-bit CPUs, launched in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Although the latter was less capable than the former, it was considerably cheaper, which is why Acorn Computers, Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and many others bought it in droves to power their computers and consoles. Such was the popularity of the 6502 that Gates and Ric Weiland wrote a port of BASIC specifically for that processor, which Commodore paid a flat license fee to use on its PET computer (then i…",

Football Manager 26's Steam entry has just appeared, barely a month after publisher Sega first announced it and roughly seven months after the shocking cancellation of Football Manager 25 . Along with a first-look video of what to expect, the Steam listing also includes two sets of PC system requirements, the usual 'minimum' and 'recommended'. The Football Manager series has a long history of running fine on basic PCs, though the switch to using Unity as the game engine for FM 26 might lead you to think that something more potent would be needed. Well, you've got absolutely no worries on that count.

    "body": "Beating the Fourth Chorus in Hollow Knight: Silksong requires you to put on your thinking cap, though admittedly only at a jaunty angle. This is the first boss you'll face in Silksong that actually has a bit of a gimmick, and you'll have to do something very specific to conclude the fight. It doesn't help that he constantly smashes the platform you're standing on so you fall into the lava. If you haven't reached this point yet or got the Drifter's Cloak, you'll need to find some Hokers before you can escape the Far Fields. You'll actually need that upgrade in this fight, plus it's the only way you can reach this boss on the way out of the area anyway.

It's also kind of urgent, as you're basically trapped in the areas near her until you do, since she crafts you the item you need to use on the wind pillars to float your way out of the hole. You need to gather 25 Spine Cores from these creatures, but unlike gathering the pilgrim shawls for Bone Bottom, these items don't simply drop from killing them—there's a special trick to farming the item. All that said, here's where to find Hokers and how to gather Spine Cores in Silksong.

Fortunately, the Cult of the Lamb social media pages have been drip-feeding information to us about the size of the DLC in comparison to the first game, how it ended up getting slightly out of hand, and why the devs have chosen to release a paid update rather than another free one. According to a TikTok posted by Cult of the Lamb , the DLC will be \"almost as long as the original game\" for no other reason than \"we flew a little too close to the sun here. We tend to go all out, be at weddings, to raves, to three free massive content updates. This DLC is not free, but I promise you'll love it.\" They're not wrong, either. If there's one game I know I can rely on when it comes to crazy marketing, it would be Cult of the Lamb. Though, despite the promise of another hefty adventure as a cult leader, the fact the DLC is paid is what is confusing a significant number of players.
