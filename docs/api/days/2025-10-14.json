The company has announced \"Help Me Schedule\" is coming to Gmail, leveraging Gemini AI to recognize when you want to schedule a meeting and offering possible meeting times for the email recipient to choose. The new meeting feature is reminiscent of Magic Cue on Google's latest Pixel phones. As you type emails, Gmail will be able to recognize when you are planning a meeting. A Help Me Schedule button will appear in the toolbar. Upon clicking, Google's AI will swing into action and find possible meeting times that match the context of your message and are available in your calendar. When you engage with Help me schedule, the AI generates an in-line meeting widget for your message. The recipient can select the time that works for them, and that's it—the meeting is scheduled for both parties. What about meetings with more than one invitee? Google says the feature won't support groups at launch. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "The prospects of continued electric vehicle adoption in the US are in an odd place. As promised, the Trump administration and its congressional Republican allies killed off as many of the clean energy and EV incentives as they could after taking power in January. Ironically, though, the end of the clean vehicle tax credit on September 30 actually spurred the sales of EVs, as customers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the soon-to-disappear $7,500 credit. Predictions for EV sales going forward aren't so rosy, and automakers are reacting by adjusting their product portfolio plans. Today, General Motors revealed that will result in a $1.6 billion hit to its balance sheet when it reports its Q3 results late this month, according to its 8-K . Q3 was a decent one for GM, with sales up 8 percent year on year and up 10 percent for the year to date. GM EV sales look even better: up 104 percent for the year to date compared to the first nine months of 2024, with nearly 145,000 electric Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and GMCs finding homes.

That doesn't mean these PCs will suddenly stop working, but if you don't take action, it does mean your PC has received its last regular security patches and that Microsoft is washing its hands of technical support. This end-of-support date comes about a decade after the initial release of Windows 10, which is typical for most Windows versions. But it comes just four years after Windows 10 was replaced by Windows 11, a version with stricter system requirements that left many older-but-still-functional PCs with no officially supported upgrade path. As a result, Windows 10 still runs on roughly 40 percent of the world's Windows PCs (or around a third of US-based PCs), according to StatCounter data . But this end-of-support date also isn't set in stone. Home users with Windows 10 PCs can enroll in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which extends the support timeline by another year. We've published directions for how to do this here —while you do need one of the Microsoft accounts that the company is always pushing, it's relatively trivial to enroll in the ESU program for free.

    "body": "انتقد الأسطورة الهولندي ماركو فان باستن، مهاجم ميلان التاريخي، أداء مواطنه فرينكي دي يونج، نجم وسط برشلونة، مع منتخب بلاده. وكانت صحيفة \"موندو ديبورتيفو\" الإسبانية، قد أفادت بأن دي يونج سيوقع عقدًا جديد مع برشلونة، يوم الأربعاء المقبل، سيكون ساريًا لمدة 4 سنوات أخرى، أي حتى صيف 2029. الخطوة تحمل بعدًا ماليًا واضحًا من جانب برشلونة، إذ تتيح له إدارة أفضل لتوازنات الرواتب وهيكل الإنفاق في ظل سياسة ترشيد النفقات التي يتبعها النادي منذ عدة مواسم، في محاولة للالتزام بلوائح اللعب المالي النظيف التي تفرضها رابطة الدوري الإسباني. وأعرب فان باستن، عن خيبة أمله في أداء دي يونج، مشيرًا إلى أنه توقع المزيد من الحركة للاعب برشلونة وقال: \"توقعنا أن يُسرع فرينكي من وتيرة اللعب، لكنه لم يفعل، لقد وجدت ذلك مخيبًا للآمال\". وأضاف: \"دور دي يونج هو نقل الكرة بسرعة من الخلف إلى الأمام، لكنه نادرًا ما كان يفعل ذلك، إنه لأمر مؤسف لأنه يمتلك الرؤية والمهارات اللازمة للقيام بذلك، يلعب بيدري أسرع ويخاطر أكثر في الهجوم، هذا ما نتوقعه من فرينكي\". وأتم: \"في برشلونة، دي يونج أكثر إنتاجية لكن مع المنتخب الوطني يفعل كل شيء ببطء شديد\". وأوضحت الصحيفة، أن راتب دي يونج للفترة المتبقية من الموسم الحالي سيكون حسب الاتفاق القديم، بينما سيبدأ راتبه الجديد بدءًا من 1 يوليو/ تموز المقبل مع بداية موسم 2026/27. ولفتت الصحيف…",

The rocket's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines roared to life at 6:23 pm CDT (7:23 pm EDT; 23:23 UTC), throttling up to generate some 16.7 million pounds of thrust, by large measure more powerful than any rocket before Starship. Moments later, the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket began a vertical climb away from SpaceX's test site in Starbase, Texas, near the US-Mexico border. From then on, the rocket executed its flight plan like clockwork. This was arguably SpaceX's most successful Starship test flight to date. The only flight with a similar claim occurred one year ago Monday, when the company caught the rocket's Super Heavy booster back at the launch pad after soaring to the uppermost fringes of the atmosphere. But that flight didn't accomplish as much in space. Read full article Comments",

Twenty-one days is the maximum incubation period, spanning from when a person is exposed to when they would develop a rash if infected. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "Google began experimenting with conversational image editing earlier this year in the dev-focused AI studio, but the feature didn't remain experimental for long. Over the summer, Google rolled out the \" Nano Banana \" image-editing model in Gemini 2.5 Flash. You can use this feature to modify images with just a prompt, and now you don't even need to go to Gemini to use it. Google says Nano Banana is now coming to search, Google Photos, and NotebookLM. The AI image editor is coming to search via Lens and AI Mode. For Lens, you can simply open the app (iOS and Android) and snap a photo to get started. When the rollout is complete, you'll see a \"Create\" button at the bottom, with a banana icon. Tap that to enter a prompt, telling the AI how you'd like the photo changed.

    "body": "The encryption protecting communications against criminal and nation-state snooping is under threat. As private industry and governments get closer to building useful quantum computers, the algorithms protecting Bitcoin wallets, encrypted web visits, and other sensitive secrets will be useless. No one doubts the day will come, but as the now-common joke in cryptography circles observes, experts have been forecasting this cryptocalypse will arrive in the next 15 to 30 years for the past 30 years. The uncertainty has created something of an existential dilemma: Should network architects spend the billions of dollars required to wean themselves off quantum-vulnerable algorithms now, or should they prioritize their limited security budgets fighting more immediate threats such as ransomware and espionage attacks? Given the expense and no clear deadline, it’s little wonder that less than half of all TLS connections made inside the Cloudflare network and only 18 percent of Fortune 500 networks support quantum-resistant TLS connections. It's all but certain that many fewer organizations still are supporting quantum-ready encryption in less prominent protocols. Triumph of the cypherpunks O…",

In a press release provided to Ars, Ofcom said 4chan refused to respond to two requests for information that the regulator considered \"routine.\" The first asked for the risk assessment and the second for 4chan's \"qualifying worldwide revenue.\" 4chan was anticipating the Monday fine, noting in a lawsuit —which was jointly filed with the online trolling forum Kiwi Farms in August and seeks to permanently enjoin Ofcom from enforcing OSA—that Ofcom had made it clear that because 4chan ignored Ofcom's emails, the fine was coming.

Numbers are still sketchy, but reports from Friday indicate that more than 4,000 federal workers overall were initially targeted for layoffs. The Trump administration linked the firings to the ongoing government shutdown, which legal experts have suggested is illegal. Unions representing federal workers have already filed a lawsuit challenging the move. Of the reported 4,000 terminations, about 1,100 to 1,200 were among employees in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS is a massive department that houses critical federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, among others. Before Trump's second term, the HHS workforce was about 82,000, but that was slashed to about 62,000 earlier this year amid initial cuts and efforts to push civil servants out.

    "body": "Owners of some Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids have been left stranded after installing an over-the-air software update this weekend. The automaker pushed out a telematics update for the Uconnect infotainment system that evidently wasn't ready, resulting in cars losing power while driving and then becoming stranded. Stranded Jeep owners have been detailing their experiences in forum and Reddit posts, as well as on YouTube. The buggy update doesn't appear to brick the car immediately. Instead, the failure appears to occur while driving—a far more serious problem. For some, this happened close to home and at low speed, but others claim to have experienced a powertrain failure at highway speeds. Jeep pulled the update after reports of problems, but the software had already downloaded to many owners' cars by then. A member of Stellantis' social engagement team told 4xe owners at a Jeep forum to ignore the update pop-up if they haven't installed it yet. Read full article Comments",
