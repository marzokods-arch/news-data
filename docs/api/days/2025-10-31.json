Despite multiple interviews with key Embark personnel in recent days, it's hard to pin down exactly what pieces of Arc Raiders result from what sort of AI. \"Arc Raiders in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,\" design director Virgil Watkins said in an interview with PCGamesN . Studio CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer much the same, saying \"the experience of the game doesn't use any generative AI.\" But as soon as you dig past the surface of those broad dismissals, the details grow muddier. The Finals was an early case of AI usage stoking controversy and conversation around the usage of AI tools in game development. Embark specifically drew heat for using text-to-speech audio generation for many of the game's voice lines, a process it's continued to use in Arc Raiders. In his interview with Euro…",

That number includes a lot of extremely skippable short story anthologies, and multiple novels so tangential you won't miss anything if you don't read them. If it's such a daunting thing you need a guide to get through it, why bother at all? Because at its best the Horus Heresy is an achievement in shared-world history-building unlike anything else, and a gripping saga on a scale you couldn't get if multiple authors weren't working together to build a dementedly labyrinthine backstory for toy soldier games. The Horus Heresy is a prequel set 10,000 years before the rest of Warhammer 40,000, telling the story that explains why its dystopian future is so bad. The Imperium of the year 30,000 may not be a great place, but unlike the 41st millennium it contains a spark of hope and the possibility things can change.

Unlike the other event plants, you'll have a few extra steps to follow before you can pluck these strange flowers and throw them into the cauldron. It's one of five resources added exclusively for Halloween, and seems to be the most common ingredient among the new recipes.

You're summoned to a hotel on a weekend when a seance is planned for All Hallow's Eve, and a whole host of varyingly suspicious people have shown up to participate. You've been hired to find a woman who checked into the hotel but apparently didn't check out, and the clock is ticking: you'll need to solve the crime before the end of the weekend and all the guests depart.

In just a few minutes it teaches you the basics of moving and shooting, looting, and learning the hard way what happens when you make too much noise in a PvPvE game: either a robot or another player is going to hear you and come out guns blazing. When you try to pry open a door in the tutorial, a pair of NPCs will suddenly appear to gun you down, then loot your body while you're incapacitated. But savvy players have figured out that if you drop all your items before that cutscene plays, you can pick them back up off the ground once your character awakens and then finish the rest of the tutorial with your pockets stuffed with goodies. None of the salvage you'll find in the tutorial is particularly important or mega valuable—you'll find much more and better stuff once you start playing the game proper—but why not take the leg up? It takes only a few seconds to pull up your inventory and empty your pockets. To keep all the loot from Arc Raiders' tutorial, make sure to drop it before you open the door in the abandoned pizza restaurant . That includes the weapon you have equipped, everything in your backpack…",

Midnight alpha testing started at the beginning of October and brought with it sweeping changes to its combat and classes, as well as an entire player housing system. Blizzard surprised everyone by completely disabling the functionality of the most popular mods that help players fight bosses and track their abilities, prompting some mod makers to cease development of their mods entirely . As a result of Blizzard's move to simplify the game so people don't have to rely on third-party mods, it also went through and reduced the amount of buttons you need to press for its most complicated classes. Unsurprisingly, these changes didn't go over well with everyone, and many high-level players are worried about the state of class design going into the full release. Today, Blizzard announced that the beta for Midnight will begin on November 11, which I'm sure doesn't assuage concerns over the current state of the game. For comparison: The…",

Take the Just Cause movie, which was announced way back in 2011 and still hasn't materialized , or the Beyond Good and Evil film announced in 2020 that is just as MIA as Beyond Good and Evil 2 . So when a Call of Duty film adaptation was announced last month, I figured there was a chance we might not hear about it for a while—or maybe not ever again. Wrong. Activision and Paramount just announced that Taylor Sheridan, co-creator of your dad's favorite TV show and its roughly 36 different spinoffs, Yellowstone, is writing the script for the Call of Duty movie. Co-writing and directing is Peter Berg, developer of Friday Night Lights. Sheridan is a huge get—NBCUniversal reportedly spent in the neighborhood of $1 billion to woo him away from Paramount starting in 2029—and as a result Call of Duty is suddenly looking like a huge movie. No stars have been announced yet, but I'd bet money Mark Wahlberg is blowing up Sheridan's phone right about now. At least we can assume Frank Grillo and Jon Bernthal will b…",

Arc Raiders has a unique conceit for a PvPvE game that's fundamentally about filling a backpack with valuable stuff: You're a citizen of Spiranza, an underground city founded after humanity was forced underground by the Arc, a brigade of homicidal robots that dropped out of the sky one day. At the time of the game, the Arc have dominated the planet's surface for generations. As a raider, you're one of the few souls bold enough to brave the surface to loot for valuables. Sure, my main concern is finding batteries so I can craft a table that lets me craft scopes so that I can snipe other players, but as I'm foraging for scrap metal just outside the vision cone of a flame-throwing bowling ball, I have wondered who built these freaky little robots.

Things have settled now and the game is holding steady at around 25,000 concurrent players on Steam—which isn't half bad for an early access game still getting its footing.

In the words of PC Gamer's Morgan Park, Arc Raiders built up major buzz with a playtest in early 2025 thanks to its potent mix of \"the bones of Escape From Tarkov, the approachability of Gears of War, and the keen architectural eye of Swedish game development.\" It even overshadowed Bungie's long-awaited Marathon. After a few more betas to test the waters, Arc Raiders finally landed on October 30. As PC Gamer's Elie Gould breaks down in our Arc Raiders review-in-progress , PvP is an important element of the game, but may not be as big a focus as you'd expect. You'll spend much of your time hunting for loot and fighting (or avoiding) the Arc robots, making it \"quite different, both in vibes and execution\" than Escape From Tarkov. But Arc Raiders is still a big game with lots to learn: Where and what to loot, how to avoid or take down the Arc bots, the best gear and weapon upgrades, and so on. Below you'll find a collection of all of our Arc Raiders guides meant to give you a fighting chance on the surface where killer bot…",

There are certain spots scattered across each Arc Raiders map where you're more likely to find technological or electrical items like wires and batteries , and chances are, if you search a computer, you'll find what you need. But this isn't always guaranteed, and sometimes you'll raid rooms that have already been sorted through and stripped of valuables.

As reported by Eurogamer , Capcom published its most recent financial report earlier this week covering the first half of the fiscal year—from around the start of April 'til the end of September. Taking a gander over some of the developer's big sellers for that time period, Monster Hunter Wilds is barely clinging onto the top 10 list, sitting right at the bottom with 637,000 units sold. That's still not bad, mind, but perhaps surprising when framed alongside other games like previous entry Monster Hunter Rise, shifting a skosh more copies at 643,000 units. I am surprised to see Rise beating out Wilds, but not entirely shocked to see the latter struggling behind the rest of Capcom's big hitters. The game continues to sit at a Mixed rating on Steam, thanks in large part to its downright atrocious optimisation (which only feels a hair better eight months after release) which has even left folks with fairly beefy rigs struggling …",

Some PCs can't even run the OS without tweaking, and potential users may want to avoid having to make a Microsoft account just to use their own rig. Recent reports suggest YouTube might be cracking down on content encouraging these workarounds, though. YouTuber CyberCPU Tech has recently shared that they've had two videos removed in two days (via Tom's Hardware ). Both of those videos are reportedly about ways to bypass Windows 11 requirements. One was a tutorial on how to install Windows 11 without a Microsoft account. The other was on how to install the latest version of Windows on unsupported hardware. CyberCPU Tech says that both were taken down due to automated systems, but both were denied appeals. The first appeal was denied after just 45 minutes, and the second after just five. In a previous video , he said that he had spoken to a support specialist (whom he believes could be AI) who said the Windows 11 videos promote \"behaviour that encourages dangerous or illegal activities that risk serious physical harm or death.\" Naturally, we have to take the reported words of …",

As explained on its site , this doesn't mean forcing companies to maintain servers forever—rather, it requires them to have some sort of end-of-life plan in mind, which can take a lot of forms. For instance, giving fan communities the tools they need to run their own local servers. EU initiatives have a lot of stringent requirements before they can get in front of the politicians, including at least 1 million signatures, a minimum number of signatories each from a specific roster of countries, and—more importantly— verified signatures. Essentially, if you don't follow the rules, or aren't from within the EU, then your signature doesn't count. That question mark hung over the whole endeavour.

Well, it turns out this robot has much to learn; Engadget reports that the Neo will lean heavily on tele-operation at least to begin with. In other words, you're not just welcoming Neo into your home, but potentially the 1X Tech employee piloting it remotely too. The hope is that the real world experience that comes from tele-operation in early adopters' homes can be leveraged as AI training data (so yes, you'd also be welcoming a camera into your home too).

With such high stakes but great rewards on the line, it's important to know what you're getting into if you're contemplating sending your raider on an Expedition. Below, I'll go over how to go on an Expedition, everything you'll need to prepare, and what progress is kept and what's lost. Arc Raiders Expeditions explained (Image credit: Embark) Expeditions is Arc Raiders' approach to server wipes, giving you an optional way to retire your raiders and 'prestige' your account, losing most progression in the process. Expeditions have five main stages before reaching the final departure window, each requiring you to deliver different items and resources to build a caravan and prep it for travel. Only once you've completed these preparation steps can you officially send your raider on their merry way, never to be seen again. Importantly, Expeditions run on a roughly eight-w…",

But what if I told you it doesn't have to be that way? That, for a small price, you could upgrade guns instead of simply relying on pure hope, luck, and a good bit of scavenging for higher rarity alternatives? Well, you can. Only after spending hours with Arc Raiders did I figure out that you can actually upgrade every single weapon you find or craft to a higher tier, finally explaining why guns have a Roman numeral next to their name. That terrible common Rattler I can become a slightly less terrible common Rattler II or even higher if you've got the necessary resources.
