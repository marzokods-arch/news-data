    "body": "Matthew 'Mizkif' Rinaudo, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch, has filed a lawsuit against Emily 'Emiru' Schunk and Zack 'Asmongold' Hoyt alongside three media companies for defamation and breach of contract. As reported by KXAN , the suit follows allegations made against Mizkif by Emiru in which she accused him of \"psychological and domestic abuse, stalking, harassment, sexual assault, and threats of blackmail\" during an October 24 livestream. During the stream, Emiru alleges that Mizkif had \"been indirectly threatening me through my friends and people that I work with,\" claiming that \"his plan was to claim that I kill animals and that I killed my own rabbits.\" She told her stream : \"I think everyone who paid attention knew that he was very controlling over what I wore, to a degree who I was friends with, and even when I would stream.\" Allegations included having plastic bottles thrown at her, a phone thrown at her eye, and aggressive behaviour. She also afforded sparse details of the \"extremely private relationship\" the two engaged in between 2022 and 2025, along with allegations of an incident that took place where Mizkif \"tried to comfort me by hugging me while I was s…",

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers. Not all of it…",

Specifically, that's the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, the only version of AMD's Strix Halo mobile APU that's available with all 40 RDNA 3.5-spec graphics compute units available. And it's those 40 CUs, plus Strix Halo's exceptionally wide (for an APU) 256-bit bus, that make it so appealing, on paper, for gaming. But it also makes it expensive, as the new OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex amply proves. For the record, you can get the OneXFly Apex with Ryzen AI Max 385 starting at $1,399. But that has a downsized GPU with 32 CUs, significantly lessening the appeal of the device. Anyway, the \"base\" model with the top-tier 395 APU kicks off with a hefty 48 GB of memory. If that sounds like overkill, especially for a handheld, remember it's shared between the CPU and GPU. You also get a 1 TB SSD. The OneXFly Apex can be optioned up to 128 GB of memory and a 2 TB SSD. If you also go for the model with liquid cooling, you'll be looking at a mind-blowing price of $2,299. For a handheld. Bananas. As Andy explained previously , other hig…",

This might seem like a colossally expensive thing to do, but when one of the aforementioned companies just happens to be Google, you know that the upfront cost probably isn't an issue. With the name Project Suncatcher , you'd be forgiven for thinking that Google is hoping to design a special solar panel system to power all of its data centers. Well, that's partially correct, but Project Suncatcher aims to use the power of the Sun by getting just a teeny bit closer to it, by putting the data centers in space. This isn't some whimsical fantasy; Google has seriously thought about all of this, as detailed in its research paper (PDF warning) on the project.

    "body": "In Counter-Strike 2, milliseconds matter. The tiniest time-slice can be the difference between virtual life and virtual death, so anything you can do to get bullets into braincases faster is likely to provide you an edge. Hence why CS2 lets players review their performance via demo playbacks. Yet because of the way the Internet works, what players see in a demo playback may not reflect the game they experienced with complete accuracy. As of Counter-Strike 2's latest update, however, players should find playbacks better representative of live matches. This is thanks to a new feature Valve introduced to the demo system named TrueView. \"With TrueView, demo playback will match the player's original experience much more closely,\" Valve writes in a Steam post . \"Previously demo playback showed the server's view of the world, without accounting for network latency. This could be confusing because shots would hit that didn't look like they should have, and vice versa.\" (Image credit: Valve) As Valve explains, TrueView attempts to solve this issue by re-running the client-side prediction.

Blizzard's current catalogue, however, doesn't leave us with many potential headliners.

In fact, one might argue that the last sentence should read 'because' rather than 'despite'. Hutchinson certainly reckons that Game Pass is part of the problem. Speaking to FRVR , Hutchinson explained that although Microsoft's service exposed Revenge of the Savage Planet to hordes of new players, this didn't convert into cold, hard cash for developer Raccoon Logic. \"We’ve had millions of players and that’s great, but people have an expectation of getting things for free these days—whether that’s through Game Pass or other things—it hasn’t monetised as well as we would like, which is pretty dangerous,\" he told the site.

Found by a team of hackers, it let players have sex with CJ's girlfriend after prompting \"movement\" commands.

I was making a series of very poor life choices, and the lack of life skills aged 25—my latest poor choice was to get up too early.\" Colombia during the '90s was, to risk an understatement, not exactly the best place to be , which is something Houser discovered first-hand: \"The police didn't start work 'till nine but the muggers started at eight. I was out walking along the beach at eight.\" He recalls speaking with someone on the beach before \"two guys came to talk to him, and I couldn't tell if they were trying to mug him, if he owed the money, or if he'd bought me to them. \"One of them had a machete and one of t…",

I think Daniel Vávra, director on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 and 2, hews closer to Fraser's position.

And while part of that's true, the recent spate of MMO news has me wondering if it's entirely our fault no new MMOs are coming out. Corporate wisdom (which is oftentimes an oxymoron) would have you believe that live services are the new moneymaker ( sure, if you hit it big , if you don't, you die) and that MMOs are unsustainable. To be fair to that wisdom, there are nuggets of truth in it. I don't mean to say that MMOs are a sure bet, far from it. MMOs are expensive, require constant maintenance, and competition is fierce because we don't like trying new stuff. But also, Amazon kinda messed New World up, and its shutdown is more about mismanagement than anything else. Contrary to hindsight, New World is not, on paper, a failed MMO.

It seems the variant we always wanted to see, which majors in graphics rather than CPU grunt, is set to be released. Chinese PC specialist SixUnited has a couple of new Ryzen AI Max models listed on its website (via Videocardz ), and indeed, a SixUnited tablet running one of the \"new\" APUs has popped up in the PassMark database . The most exciting model is the Ryzen AI Max+ 388. That combines eight CPU cores with the maximum 40 graphics compute unit count available from Strix Halo. Currently, the only way to get a version of Strix Halo with all 40 RDNA 3.5c CUs is to go with the very top Ryzen AI Max+ 395 model. That's a very expensive APU and comes with fully 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, which is arguably overkill for mobile gaming, especially within the confines of a handheld. In practice, Strix Halo has therefore thus far been of more interest as a tool for running local AI models on a limited budget than for gaming. But what if there was a cheaper model that kept the 40 graphics CUs and 256-bit memory bus, but cut the CPU d…",

It's China's latest bid to break away from US-made tech, and follows news back in August that data centre operators were being instructed to source at least 50% of their chips from domestic manufacturers . Now, data centres that are less than 30% complete are being instructed to remove already installed chips if they're foreign-made. One facility in a northwestern province that planned to deploy Nvidia chips has allegedly already been suspended before even breaking ground as a result of the latest guidance. However, it's being decided on a case-by-case basis whether data centre projects at a more advanced stage can keep their foreign-made chips.

Ever-smaller transistors and ever-larger chips have made this possible, but with the physical limits of both impacting the growth of computing, new methods are required to continue the growth. One semiconductor research team claims to have achieved just that by stacking not chips or dies, but individual transistors. The work by the team at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia was published in Nature Electronics (via El País ), and as is always the case for such academic research, it's all very complicated. Basically, though, it comes down to the idea that chip makers are looking to go up , rather than using smaller transistors or wider dies, to keep Moore's 'law' alive. Processors such as AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilise hybrid bonding techniques to stack dies on top of each other, to increase the number of transistors in the whole package, so there's more cache.

    "body": "Late in September, EA committed to two months of maintenance for The Sims 4 , as its community reported a growing number of bugs afflicting the 12-year-old life sim. The publisher wants the ageing sequel to continue as the primary platform for virtual soap operas for the foreseeable future, rather than replace it and its many expansions with a full-on sequel. But the bugs piling higher than a locust swarm in a grain silo threatened to undermine the game's foundations. The first batch of bugfixes landed with immediate effect, addressing issues like deformed pets and vanishing ghost children. Slightly later than planned, the second QoL patch has now arrived, fixing more than 150 problems raised by the community on the EA forums and social media. As with any systems-heavy game, The Sims 4's complex web of interactions often produces patch notes that read more like a comedy script than an actual changelog, and this latest update includes some classics of the genre. For example, EA has tweaked \"relationship decay\" on couples who have a baby because it was \"too fast and destroying relationships\" (which frankly sounds realistic to me) while Sims have also been instructed to put items lik…",

Now, Bethesda would like you to know it's gearing up to break your mods once more, but at least it's a limited subset of them this time. With Fallout 4's 10th-anniversary edition gearing up for launch in the next week, the studio's warned players that it's going to break any main menu mods they might have come November 10, presumably because Todd Howard just gets a sick thrill from it. Or, well, possibly also because FO4's anniversary version will entail changes to the game's main menu, and so mods based on futzing about with the original version of that main menu will encounter stuff they don't anticipate in the new version and spark out like a robot fed a logic problem. Which is, you gotta admit, fair enough. I'd imagine the tweaks to the main menu relate to the \"new in-game Creations menu\" that Bethesda is adding to FO4, but that's not all that's coming.

Remember, these numbers are for the third quarter of 2025, alone. But from a PC Gaming perspective, the really good news is that the figures weren't all about selling AI chips to the likes of OpenAI. Sure, AMD's data centre revenue was up 22% year-over-year to a record $4.3 billion, making it the largest single contributor. But combined client and gaming revenue increased even more, up 73% year-over-year to $4 billion. In other words, AMD is still pulling in almost as much cash from PC processors and graphics chips as it does from servers and AI clients. \"Our PC processor business is performing exceptionally well with record quarterly sales as the strong demand environment and breadth of our leadership Ryzen portfolio accelerates growth,\" Su says.

Anyway—it's really nice to see Bailey continue to meet with success. He was getting work beforehand, mind, but his international stardom's grown exponentially since 2020. Which I have to admit is probably due to him starring in Bridgerton and not because he voiced my favourite scion. He also starred in 2024's Wicked movie, which is based on a musical you might've heard of. I'm confident his new appellation won't go to his head, though.

To get the drive operational with his choice of OS (Unix), Plummer did a low-level format to handle future data, partitioned the disk into different regions for storage, and then created file systems on those partitions.

    "body": "While this isn't exactly PC gaming news, Apple recently launched a new interface for its app store when viewed in a browser. Specifically, it makes the whole shebang work just like the Apps… err… app. Still, while it looks and works as intended, Apple's web developers forgot to do something important before making it live: disabling the sourcemaps. This meant that someone was able to archive the source code for the site's entire frontend and stick it on GitHub (via Ruri on X ). Now, I can't imagine it won't be long before this all disappears, but like AMD's accidental leak of the source code for FSR 4 , once it's out on the Internet, it'll be there for good. Apple used Svelte, but forgot to remove the sourcemap 🤣 https://t.co/AfsTX2zCFR pic.twitter.com/DhWkfDEkA6 November 3, 2025 If you're wondering just what a sourcemap is and what the big deal is about disabling them, let me explain: Today's websites and web apps are complex affairs, and professional developers will often use a range of high-level tools to create the code for them. However, browsers work on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. So, the original code (i.e. the source code) needs to be transpiled for browsers, and for the …",

    "body": "In early 2024, Turtle Beach bought gamepad and peripherals company PDP for $118 million. Just before that happened, PDP released the Victrix Pro BFG. It was a pro gamepad with some neat customization features: The left stick and the D-Pad, and the right stick and the face buttons, both lived on modules which could be removed and reversed to toggle between symmetrical and asymmetrical analog stick layouts. A fightpad module was included too, so you could swap out either the left or right modules for some tactile six-button action. I'm describing this older model in such detail because this newer Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded (now labelled 'by Turtle Beach') is functionally identical to that older PC controller . There are some minor changes once you scratch the surface, but before I get to those, let's re-iterate what carries forward. Like its predecessor, the Victrix Pro Reloaded has the nowadays essential \"pro\" features, including four programmable paddle buttons, trigger stops on the L2 / R2 switches, and Hall effect analog sticks. Three d-pad variations are included, which accommodate both Xbox and Switch Pro variations, as well as a hybrid of both, and these can be popped in and ou…",

Arc Raiders has a bunch of random crap for you to collect, from toasters and alarm clocks to cat beds, olives, scrap metal, and so on. Of course, there are also guns and other, more combat-focused items to loot, too. It's a lot to juggle, admittedly, but Arc Raiders has two features more extraction games need: detailed item cards and an optional auto-unloading backpack. Each item, no matter how flashy or mundane, will have a description that tells you not only what it is and what it's used for, but also roughly where to find it. There are a few outliers with inaccurate or misleading descriptions, but for the most part, you know exactly what each item can do for you. Hell, some even clue you in on cool interactions, like throwing fireball burners as if they were grenades, or using fabric as a makeshift bandage, so it pays to read, folks. It helps that there aren't actually any completely useless items in Arc Raiders to begin with, as everyt…",

Having spent enough time with the console to create an alarmingly accurate mould of the DualSense controller with nothing but my palm prints, I think I'm qualified in saying this: the PS5 is a bit chunky, innit? YouTube maker channel Not From Concentrate apparently shares this sentiment, having shrunk the standard, bulky console into a comparatively svelte 6-litre chassis (via Videocardz ). While the base version of the PlayStation 5 is a comparatively chunkier 10.4 litres, the slim—with the detachable disc drive that looks kinda like a zit to me—is only about 7 and a half litres. So, yes, you do lose those eye-catchingly swoopey white wings but you do gain back a whole lot of space around your TV. This isn't Not From Concentrate's first attempt at a tiny PS5 build , but this latest project features support for full size M.2 form factor SSDs, and enjoys a much bigger potential storage capacity for all of your games as a result. Not only that, but this itty bitty take runs even cooler and draws less power than a standard PS5 too. Du…",

A big question that has come up as the game transforms yet again, is how often this is going to happen, and if it will continue for the foreseeable future. Speaking in an interview with Diablo streamer Raxxanterax , associate game director Zaven Haroutunian touched on this concern. \"The intention is not to replace everything just because we can,\" he said. Instead, the team tries to get a \"holistic picture of the whole game,\" and look at \"what is not pulling its weight, what is not helping support the player experience in a positive way.\" Haroutunian says monster types were one of the things that went untouched since the game launched and that they needed to be redone before a dungeon with leaderboards could be added. The Tower dungeon coming in the next season relies on the new monster types to gauge your completion progress, encouraging you to seek out tougher enemies for more points—something that just wouldn't work wit…",

Blueprints are one of the rarest drops in Arc Raiders , as they unlock the ability to craft weapons permanently instead of waiting for them to show up in the shop. The Anvil is a great blueprint to secure early on thanks to the gun's high damage and its Arc armor-penetrating heavy ammo. It's like carrying a pocket Ferro that you don't have to reload after every shot. Because blueprint spawns are somewhat random, there's no surefire place to get an Anvil blueprint. There are, however, raider containers that have a high chance of containing weapon blueprints. Thanks to the investigative work of the community, these caches can be tracked down with consistency. Where I found the Anvil blueprint I found the Anvil blueprint in a convenient hidey hole on Dam Battlegrounds that seems to always spawn raider containers. The raider cache spawns in a gap under where the raised highway on Dam Battlegrounds ends. The spot is between Raider Outpost East and East Broken Bridge.

    "body": "When Telltale Games came to a messy end , it seemed like the end of the line for that particular style of episodic modern choice-and-consequence adventure game. In retrospect, Life is Strange looked like a blip, a one-hit wonder whose success wasn't repeated by any of its spin-offs or follow-ups. No amount of editorials about why Telltale mattered could bring those games back. Which is why it's a pleasant surprise to see that Dispatch has done so well. Its developer, Adhoc Studio, just posted that it's sold over a million copies in 10 days , and it's not even done yet, with the final two episodes of its six-episode run due out on Wednesday at 9 am PST. Adhoc was founded by ex-Telltale staff , and includes writer Pierre Shorette, whose credits are basically a Telltale best-of list that includes Tales from the Borderlands, The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead, and Batman: The Telltale Series. Dispatch feels like an evolution of those games rather than a rehash of the formula, though—a superhero workplace comedy about the poor schmuck deciding who gets sent to to negotiate a hostage release and who gets sent to fetch a cat in a tree, it incorporates a management sim minigame where you…",

That's the overarching vibe, at least. But there are other things Arc Raiders makes abundantly clear. For instance: the Leaper. Embark Studios could have named this four-legged, spidery walking robot, one of the first truly serious threats you'll encounter on the surface, anything. Marauder. Devastator. Wriggler. Chuckles. I assume the studio went with Leaper because it did not need to get fancy to make these particular robots seem imposing. All Embark's writers needed to do was imagine what someone would shout after seeing a robot the size of a winnebago jump the length of a football field to pulp their friend who just made a little too much noise prying open a rusty dumpster.

'Frodo walks from the Shire to Mordor,' as it's called, is not as dramatic or exciting as Peter Jackson's famed film trilogy: It is literally a recording of Frodo walking— walking , take note, not running, although he does get to ride here and there when the books say so—along the route originally followed by the Fellowship. At various spots along the way, Andy Serkis chimes in to describe the scene via audio clips taken from the Lord of the Rings audiobooks, which as chosen line up remarkably well with the events happening on screen.
