We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Over the course of its 30 years in the industry, BioWare has developed some of the best and most memorable RPGs of all time. Though its present success may be a little in doubt, that legacy remains an astonishing addition to videogame canon. Which is why I expect you to remember it all, down to every last title. Today's quiz is simple—you just have to name every game BioWare has ever made. To be clear, that's only games it developed itself, and only ones that actually released—no cancelled projects. But to warn you, it does include some games that didn't come out on PC. I'm afraid you do have to remember the one time they made an RPG for a Nintendo handheld. And just to make it a bit trickier, you've got to do it in two minutes. Ready? Scroll down to the quiz below to start. Let us know how you did in the comments!",

I'm Not a Robot takes the Internet's reviled not-really-a-security-check and stretches it to its most preposterous limits.

While it's unlikely we'll ever see Dice Poker get an official spinoff in the way Gwent did , it does finally have its own dedicated roguelike. Dead Finger Dice is an Inscryption -ish mix of digital tabletop gaming and spooky narrative puzzling, with a gnarly twist where you use your character's fingers as betting currency. The premise is that you've been kidnapped and imprisoned aboard The Avarice, a luxury yacht inhabited by bloodthirsty demonic billionaires. These sadistic superrich monsters, who include Nosferatu-ish vampires and snake-headed Medusas among their ranks, force you to play games of Dice Poker, where you get five dice and four rolls to achieve the highest-scoring poker-hand you can.

    "body": "تسببت صورة في حالة من الغضب لدى الفرنسي كريم بنزيما، مهاجم الاتحاد، عقب خسارة الكلاسيكو ضد الغريم التقليدي النصر. وتعرض الاتحاد لأول هزيمة في الموسم الحالي من الدوري السعودي، وذلك أمام النصر بنتيجة 0-2، مساء الجمعة، على ملعب الإنماء، في الجولة الرابعة. وتداول رواد مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي مقطع فيديو لبنزيما أثناء خروجه من ملعب المباراة، حيث طلبت منه صحفية التوقيع على إحدى الصور، لكن لم يكشف المقطع عن تفاصيل الصورة. وبحسب ما كشف عنه رواد مواقع التواصل، فقد كانت الصورة تسخر من المهاجم الفرنسي نفسه. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🗣️! - هل يمكنك التوقيع على هذه الصورة؟ كريم بنزيما : • أنت ظريف جدًا! أليس كذلك؟ • هل تحاول أن تكون ظريفًا أم ماذا؟ • خذ ترندك وأغراضك. pic.twitter.com/ptzebyxIyH &mdash; ستوديو الاتحاد | ITTI STUDIO (@IttiStudio) September 26, 2025 وعندما شاهد أسطورة ريال مدريد الصورة، رد قائلًا: \"تعتقدين أنك ظريفة أم ماذا؟\"، لتجيب: \"هذا مجرد تريند نقوم به\". ورفض بنزيما التوقيع على الصورة، وأعاد للصحفية الصورة وقلمها، معلقًا: \"خذي التريند الخاص بك، وخذي أشياءك\". وفشل المهاجم الفرنسي في انتشال فريقه من الخسارة، في أول مباراة يخوضها مع الاتحاد، بعدما غاب عن المباريات الثلاثة الماضية بسبب الإصابة، الأمر الذي ساعد على إظهار غضبه أمام مزحة الصحفية عقب المباراة.",

    "body": "FBC: Firebreak was a bit of a disappointment when it released back in June. There was certainly potential in running around playing janitor within the brutalist interdimensional nexus known as The Oldest House. But Remedy's cooperative shooter simply didn't feel ready for action, as I discovered in my FBC: Firebreak review . It was too lean, too repetitive, too unbalanced, and lacked some fundamental features like a proper tutorial. Remedy has spent the last few months plugging holes in Firebreak's leaky hull, but the latest patch, which arrives next week, represents the studio's first proper attempt to turn the ship around. The dramatically named Breakpoint update seems, on paper, to represent a complete overhaul of Firebreak's core experience, while also adding a whole new mission and a bunch of smaller features, too. At the heart of Breakpoint is a total rework of how missions are selected. The Jobs board—from which players picked a mission to play and then customised its difficulty and length—has been hacked to splinters with a fire axe and tossed into a skip. It's replaced by a 'Crises' board that offers a tailored selection of Jobs with preset lengths that refresh every 30 m…",

    "body": "As reported by the The Wall Street Journal , gaming giant EA is set to go private⁠—that is, no longer be traded on the stock market⁠—in a $50 billion deal with an investor group. This would be the largest such leveraged buyout ever recorded. According to the WSJ's anonymous sources, EA could be sold for as much as $50 billion, though the final price has not yet been agreed on, and EA has an estimated market value of $43 billion. The group of investors reportedly includes the private equity firm Silver Lake and the government of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The deal could be announced as early as next week, and would be the largest leveraged buyout ever recorded. A leveraged buyout is when a private equity firm uses a significant amount of borrowed money to seal the deal, with the asset set to be acquired used as collateral in the debt. This effectively leaves the acquired company liable for the debt⁠—if its income can't adequately service the debt, it will bear the consequences of a default, not the investors who made the purchase, and that usually means closures and layoffs. As reported by the Los Angeles Times , one such leveraged buyout eventually resulted in bankrupt…",

According to YouTuber Kilroy Was Here , there is apparently a specific set of speedrunning tricks you can perform that will lock protagonist Hornet in jail with no escape and no way to continue the game. Plenty of players have already been to The Slab , a prison area you get taken to after being captured by a specific enemy early in the game. It's a scary place that strips you of your gear and forces you to fight your way out with your bare hands and basic movement abilities. Parts of Silksong can be cruel, but Team Cherry at least designed it so you can't be imprisoned unless you've progressed far enough into the game to have the tools you need to escape. Or so we thought. Kilroy found a way to get there without those tools, sentencing poor Hornet to life in bug prison. \"I don't know why anyone would want to do this, but I have done it anyway,\" the YouTube description reads. \"Rest in peace Hornet.\" Sending Ho…",

Presented via Steam news post, the new mechanic is the \"tumble grab.\" When the update drops, you'll be able to latch onto things even after you've flung your condensed little trashcan body. Once the red outlines on the edges of the screen turn yellow, you can grab weapons and items—and even the level geometry. While tumble grabbing, your beam will be able to grapple onto any surface. That means you can, with some finesse, climb up walls and across the ceiling by flinging your tumbling body. Your tumble grabbing ability is tied to your stamina, however, so there's at least going to be one limiting factor preventing complete wall-climbing chaos. \"Tumble Grab also means that you can grab stuff in situations you previously couldn’t,\" Semiwork said. \"For example, if you’re levitated by the vicious Mentalist, you can grab a weapon and fight back!\" Semiwork demonstrated the power of the tumble grab in an accompanying video .

In the video that accompanied the post, game director Jonathan Rogers explained that GGG is pushing those updates now to give them a little more time to breathe before the next content update, which should come sometime around the end of the year. Path of Exile 2's 0.3 update, The Third Edict, came out at the end of August to warm reception . Introducing Act 4 released us from the hell of running Acts 1-3 twice whenever we want to level a character, the Abyss mechanic is fun and rewarding, and in general the community has been happy with the direction of the game. One thorny issue that continues to plague PoE2, however, is the endgame. Currently, in order to juice our maps and for the best rewards, we have to navigate the Atlas of Worlds until we find a spot with multiple overlapping towers. The more towers, the more slots we have for tablets, the more loot we get. This leads to a problem where all the maps we run that don't have multiple towers near them feel like wasting time, something to slog through unt…",

Others got indoctrinated by Booktok (the book side of TikTok) and still others were gripped by the rise of the romantasy subgenre.

    "body": "If you've been following the lead-up to Silent Hill f's release, then you've probably heard some not-so-great things about its combat. I'll concede that the first few enemy encounters can feel bad, rusty-old-knife-getting-sunk-into-your-shoulder bad. But it does get better, especially once you realise that you can just ignore most of the monsters you come across. I'm something of a magpie and a hoarder in survival horror games, which means that I collect every single item I come across and then never want to use them. So my solution to this has always been to rely on being as sneaky as possible and perfecting the art of the dodge. And just like most survival games, it works a charm: I found every single note, letter, item, and omamori in Silent Hill f, and I hardly killed a thing. (Image credit: Konami) One of the benefits of Silent Hill f being a third-person horror game is that you can play corners; I used this to check corners and alleyways before I walked around or past them. Not only did this save me from getting jumped by knife-wielding mannequins, but it also meant I could see when an enemy was approaching and then wait until it went past to make a move to the next location…",

I'm not usually one for playing through a game multiple times; I usually get tired of everything well before the first ending in all honesty, but that's just not the case here. Every ending adds so much more to the story; they aren't simply fun easter eggs for players with a bit of extra time on their hands to find. But you don't just have to wait until the end to get new story information. You'll find new items and notes in every subsequent playthrough and even find new cutscenes as you progress through the narrative. This guide will contain minor spoilers for all five Silent Hill f endings . There are four 'proper' endings and one joke ending that carries on the extraterrestrial bit from other Silent Hill games. But while there is certainly a bad ending, there isn't a cut-and-dry good ending this time; it's far more subjective.

He's also leaving the company on something of a high: the Switch 2 launched on June 5 this year, and is the fastest-selling hardware in Nintendo's history. To be honest, and not to take anything away from Bowser, a potted plant could've probably done a decent job as NOA CEO over this period. The all-conquering Switch has continued to dominate the console market and print money, while Nintendo's also expanded into theme parks and most successfully the film industry: 2023's The Super Mario Bros.

In a blog post published yesterday, Blizzard revealed a series of new cosmetics that bring a Starcraft-themed armor set for each Diablo 4 class. And I won't blame you for cocking an eyebrow: It's not the first time Sanctuary's seen crossover cosmetics from another Blizzard IP—D4's gotten multiple rounds of Warcraft skins—but Azeroth's spiky fantasy armor feels like an easier fit for Diablo's gothic palette than Starcraft's scifi soldiers and aliens.

One such example is a new PCIe 5.0 switch for data centers, that allows data to stream directly from SSDs to GPUs, using a system called GPUDirect. That's exactly what Nvidia's RTX IO was supposed to do, except it doesn't seem to any more, which might explain why it's pretty much disappeared from everyone's radar. The switch in question is a HighPoint Rocket 7638D, as reported by Tom's Hardware . It's of no use to a gaming PC, as it's exclusively for Nvidia's AI GPUs that support a bit of tech called GPUDirect . It basically provides a direct data path between storage, such as an NVMe, and a GPU's VRAM, neatly bypassing the CPU and system memory. It's been around since 2019, a little earlier than RTX IO . That was a much-hyped feature of GeForce RTX 30-series GPUs, and Nvidia expressly said that it allows \"streaming directly from SSD to GPU memory.\" However, if you read the current webpage for RTX IO , that's not mentioned at all, and instead just focuses on its other performance-enh…",

Nebula 's 58 minute, 52 second speedrun (thanks, GamesRadar+ ) shows some already-impressive tech.

What really surprises me, as I watch them tearing through Lace like a knife through… well, lace, is their use of the clawline—it seems like you can use it to interrupt your own swings to get more damage out, which is just good advice for anybody. Another thing that's interesting is a complete lack of tools. I'd assumed speedrunners might (and still could) make use out of the game's extensive tool system, but I figure getting the memory lockets and shards to support them—nevermind the tools themselves—might just take too long.

Origins is essentially Habbo Hotel's answer to WoW Classic—a stripped-back version of the social MMO that's closer to its original browser days than… whatever NFT nonsense it was touting around back when that was a thing. It's described as \"Habbo as it was in 2005, lovingly restored,\" launching last summer as a standalone launcher for PC. Our own Harvey Randall dove in to try it out when servers went live, writing that Origins felt like \"some ancient insect preserved in amber.\" Of course, it had taken no time at all for folks to resurrect bygone traditions like blocking the pool ladder while declaring it to be closed, a scenario old Habbo heads will be all too familiar with. \"Habbo Hotel: Origins, truthfully, feels like stepping into a portal to a time where the internet was wild, anachronistic, and had an entirely different set of ways in which it'd scar unsupervised children for lif…",

Sometimes the games I'm torn between are very similar; this is not one of those times.

There's also a 3v3 ranked matchmaking mode—though I'm not entirely sure this was the play. There's no current option to queue for both 3v3s and 5v5s at the same time, meaning you're gonna be splitting your playerbase in two.

Called Uprising, it seems like RGG Studio's attempt at delving into a more modern fighting game formula with \"dynamic momentum-shifting opportunities,\" according to the presentation. These opportunities come in the form of new mechanics Flowguard, Break and Rush, and the Stunner and Stun Combo systems. The first is a \"new defensive system designed with stylish movements,\" which RGG Studio says \"expands options and introduces fresh dynamics for offense and defense beyond traditional guarding.\" Flowguard's defensive options are closely tied to Break and Rush, which seems to be the main selling point behind Uprising. It's essentially a part break system—repeatedly damaging the same body parts—like the head, body, and legs—will eventually open up huge vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to gain access to \"powerful offensive o…",

Although the technology will initially be limited to the Asus ROG Xbox Ally handhelds and games purchased through the Xbox app, an update to Agility SDK means that other vendors and merchants can now get started on supporting it too. Microsoft's Agility software development kit (SDK) is a collection of tools that game developers can use to implement the latest DirectX features, without having to wait for them to be integrated into Windows itself. In the latest 1.618 version, Agility now supports Advanced Shader Delivery, which was announced last month . The rather unassuming name is for a complex database system that will hopefully be the ultimate solution to all problems relating to shader compilation. Modern 3D graphics involve tens of thousands of different shaders, and APIs such as DirectX, Vulkan, or Metal generate them in a common format. For your graphics card to be able to process them, they need to be compiled specifically for that hardware. For gaming PCs, that process is carried out by the GPU drivers, a…",

That's what the Sabre V2 Pro has done. Some won't get the appeal of an ultralight gaming mouse, and that's fair enough.

Give a small team of brilliant game designers the remit to make chess with toy soldiers, and I think this is what they would come up with. And yet it is not my favorite Advance Wars. My favorite, Advance Wars: Dual Strike for the Nintendo DS, is more the Chess 2 of strategy games. More units, more powers, combining those wildcard bursts in ways that drag matches out into dizzying swingy battles like games of Risk where someone's turning in their bonus cards every freaking turn . Forget perfect: I loved the bombast of Dual Strike being messily over-the-top, and on a visit to indie studio Area 35's Tokyo office ahead of TGS this week I immediately clocked that its new entry in the Tiny Metal series takes after my one true love.

HoYoverse hasn't even given us a general window yet, so all we can do is speculate and look at some of the developer's historical timelines.

Sometimes I would just stand still and rotate the analog stick so that he'd do that weird whooshing wormy dance that looks so pathetic. It's fun to make Nate do dumb things and laugh at him. And get a load of his stupid walk. What an absolute loser! If you can imagine, it gets much darker than this. Baby Steps is the bleakest game I've ever played. Before being transported to a bizarre mountainous landscape full of illogical obstacles and donkey men with laddish Australian accents, Nate is a 35-year-old man living in his parents' basement.

You will be able to preorder both the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X as of today, with the standard Ally fetching $600 and the Xbox Ally X costing $1,000. The cheaper of the two devices, the white $600 ROG Xbox Ally comes with a Ryzen Z2 A processor, which offers eight RDNA 2 cores and a boost frequency of up to 1800 MHz. This is almost the same as the Steam Deck , which comes in at half the price, and benefits from the lightweight, Linux-based SteamOS. Not a good start for Microsoft. Up next is the black ROG Xbox Ally X, which has the new Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip in it and comes in at $1,000. This chip was recently benchmarked against the Z1 Extreme , which you will find in the still rather great original ROG Ally X. Despite the upgrade to three Zen 5 and five Zen 5c cores (as opposed to eight Zen 4), the Z2 Extreme only sees a performance uplift of 12% in Cyberpunk 2077 with both machines at 25 W.

The top-spec ROG Xbox Ally X , meanwhile, is $1,000. Sorry, what? Lest you have forgotten, the basic ROG Xbox Ally runs AMD's \"new\" AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip. Entirely contrary to the implications of the \"Z2\" branding, this is a very elderly SoC indeed. The Z2 A rocks four AMD Zen 2-era CPU cores and eight RDNA 2 graphics compute units. Sounds familiar? It sure does, because those are exactly the same details as the Van Gogh APU (Aerith) in OG Steam Deck circa 2022 and also the die-shrunk version of the same chip in the Steam Deck OLED (Sephiroth) . Of course, Valve has just cut the price of the basic 256 GB LCD Deck to a mere $319 . So, that's twice the price for precisely no additional gaming performance, if you go with the ROG Xbox Ally. Great. For the record, in the UK, that's £499 for the ROG Xbox Ally and £279 for the Deck. Doesn't look much better, does it?

I'm not including Mankind Divided's throwaway DLC or the port of dumpy tablet prequel The Fall in this calculation. Sorry to all five Deus Ex: The Fall fans.

No one sets out to make a bad game, but I wonder what led to its seemingly sorry state, and if anyone at Aspyr, Eidos Montreal, or Embracer is surprised at the response.
