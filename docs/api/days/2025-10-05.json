Walk into a body of water in Arctico and you'll suddenly be in a kayak, cruising over the calm blue surface toward a fishing spot. It may be a game about expanding a research base in a lonely, hostile environment, but it's a much more relaxed one, where you've got a team of pettable dogs to pull your sled right from the off. Though it came out of early access in 2020, Arctico has had some significant updates since then. There was a base-building update in June of this year, with a bunch of improvements, adjustments, and optimization to the base-building mechanics, and now there's been another update out of the blue , adding controller support and Steam Deck verification. The menus for building and accessing your inventory have all been revised to be more controller-friendly, text size tweaked for the Steam Deck version, in-game keyboards added, and the sled's input system \"adjusted to better support joystick input.\" Basically, it should play fine with your thumbs on the sticks rather than your hands on a mouse and keyboard.

Microsoft says it is growing and popular, but Xbox has been on a steady drumbeat of mass layoffs and studio closures in recent years. One of the employees speaking to Bloomberg cited the $300 million figure as an internal estimate. I've seen some skepticism about the figure, and a comparison to how publishers count every pirate download of a game as a missed sale when prosecuting pirates or commenting publicly on piracy's impact, but I don't think that quite maps on to what's going on here.

Games made using the engine also need to be patched, however, so expect a lot of games you wouldn't expect to still be receiving updates to suddenly download one out of the blue. Overcooked 2, for instance . Microsoft, which owns so many videogame studios it's hard to keep track, has announced that some of its games will be temporarily pulled from storefronts while patches for the vulnerability are worked on. Which is why, if you look for Fallout Shelter, Pentiment, Wasteland Remastered, or Wasteland 3 on the Steam store right now you won't find them. If you own them already you still have access to them, though Microsoft suggests you \"should temporarily uninstall the app.\" Even games that weren't made in Unity have been affected if their companion apps and artbook launchers, the kind you often get in deluxe editions, were. Avowed, for instance, which was developed in Unreal Engine 5, has a digital artbook that's a Unity app. It's worth noting that the security vulnerability in question hasn't actually affected anyone yet.

The game's planned system of robot prostheses for when this sort of thing happens has not been implemented yet, and more to the point, the arena gates would only open when one man was left standing. I had one potential recourse: An incredibly satisfying kick attack that ragdolls enemies and sends them flying, a perfect pairing with the instant death spike wall in one corner of the arena.

I wish I could say I rose to the occasion and blind-launched this miniboss into the spikes, but the run ended in failure. I was better prepared next time, bringing a torch to set on the ground beside the spikes, letting me lure the knight to his death before he could land a single attack.

(Image credit: Activision) Ultimately, the publisher settled with West and Zampella ahead of a trial. But the damage was done. Many of Infinity Ward's veterans had followed their bosses to Respawn, a new EA-funded outfit that would go on to make Titanfall, Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.

Now the Skyrim modding community has gotten in on the action with the release of a truly massive unofficial expansion that has been in development for more than 10 years. Lordbound transports Skyrim adventurers to the all-new valley of Druadach, a wartorn region that has recently reestablished its connection to the provinces of Skyrim and High Rock. The mod sees you embroiled in a conflict between the Imperial Legion and a band of Orcs holed up in a mountain fortress, one that just so happens to be smack in the middle of a trade route between High Rock's capital Jehanna and Skyrim's largest city, Solitude. The mod mainly adds what you'd expect from a fan-made expansion.

All you have to do is check out the screenshots, and type in the name of the game for each one—within a two minute time limit, naturally.

I may need to change these (highly theoretical) plans, however, as some three-finger-frenzied modding wizard has added a complete Witcher moveset into Miyazaki's magnum opus. Created by modder therealsqueam, the simply titled Witcher—Moveset Mod lets you get your Geralt on in The Lands Between by adding a full fighting style inspired by Andrzej Sapkowski's monster hunters into the game. It also adds the ability to cast signs, and even incorporates Geralt-style fisticuffs just in case you're caught without your weapon drawn. Chiefly, the mod replaces Milady and Leda's swords with blades of steel and silver, typically wielded by Witchers, both of which can be purchased from Merchant Kalé in Limgrave. The steel sword naturally scales with dexterity, while the silver sword dishes out big holy damage, making it ideal for dealing with undead creatures. Both swords use the same moveset, which borrows heavily from the acrobatic combat techniques seen in The Wit…",

Plus, like a certain Duke who gave his name to a certain rubber footwear, it also gives Napoleon a proper sorting out. Map generation is the primary target of update 1.2.5, with Firaxis responding to complaints that the sequel's landmasses were predictable and dull. To fix the issue, Firaxis says it has \"started from scratch and created a new base algorithm for making maps\" in Civ, while simultaneously introducing two extra map types. \"Continents and Islands\" serves as the new map default for single-player, mixing up larger and smaller landmasses of various sizes, while \"Pangaea and Islands\" situates the bulk of the action on one giant geographical inkblot, with splashes of separate terrain in and around it.

In unrelated news, the Associated Press has just reported that OpenAI's valuation has hit $500 billion , making a company that's never turned a profit into the most valuable startup in history. One market analyst reckons this tomfoolery has gone far enough, these companies and those who invest in them are about to hit \"diminishing returns hard\", and is telling their clients to steer well clear. Let's put the argument for AI as briefly as possible: It's going to change the world on a scale that is currently so unimaginable it could only be described as revolutionary.

Black Ops 7 perks function much like they did in last year's Black Ops 6: Pick three from a huge pool of bonuses, either ignoring or targeting a \"combat speciality\" bonus for using perks of the same type. The big change to perks this year is the addition of hybrid specialities, alternative bonuses to the three main combat specialities that let you mix and match perk types a bit. There are also more perks at launch than last year (27 vs 21) and some existing ones have moved around tiers, but if you got comfortable with perk combinations in Blops 6, most of them will still work the same in Blops 7. There are three perk types: Offense (red), Stealth (Blue), and Support (Green). In Blops 6, these categories were called Enforcer, Recon, and Strategist to match their associated combat specialties, but now that hybrid specialities are a thing, they were given generic names.

Megabonk almost didn't look real at first: Its aesthetic is like some kind of 3D asset nightmare where skeletons pop into Mario coins and a fox wizard shoots fireballs at Piggsy from Manhunt. It's a crude mixture of pixel art and chunky 3D models that wouldn't look out of place on a TV in the background of an episode of NCIS. But despite the assault on my eyeballs, Megabonk is a coherent, surprisingly cerebral auto-shooter roguelike in the style of Vampire Survivors. Even the creator, Vedinad, calls it \"Vampire Survivors but 3D\" in a YouTube video about its inception. You mow through waves of enemies until you die or defeat the boss, discovering all sorts of weird upgrades along the way.

Armstrong says it's all down to a proportion of the PC playerbase who still have hard disk drives (HDD) rather than solid-state drives (SSD). His full explanation follows but, essentially, Arrowhead duplicates a tonne of information in order to make the game load faster for those on HDDs (which matters because no match starts until all players have loaded the mission, regardless of hardware). \"An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data,\" says Armstrong ( thanks, VGC ). \"The time it takes for this arm to 'seek' or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck. \"To solve this problem, we deliberately duplicate certain data files (like a common tree texture or a sound effect) and place copies of them in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game.

This was partially unveiled just a few weeks ago , but we've now got a few bold claims on the pipeline of creation in the engine, plus a link to sign up for the beta. In a blog post titled \" Meta Horizon Engine at a glance \", Meta says the new engine focuses on a few major points: The first is 'Scalability from cloud to mobile', which is effectively the ability to run worlds on the cloud, and then on mobile devices. It mentions the idea of \"running on mobile phones\", which suggests you will be able to play worlds natively, which you couldn't do prior. The second is \"speed and performance\". Meta claims worlds \"load and run quickly\" with its new engine. The third is \"familiar tools\", and it says Horizon Engine will work with templates and formats that are designed to be familiar to developers. Given that Horizon Worlds are user-made, this could speed up production and lower the skill ceiling. The last element is \"platform evolution\". Effectively, Meta argu…",

Because Molyneux recently sat down with Edge to reflect on a long career of making extravagant promises about acorns, and in the process he mentioned that, yeah, his upcoming game, Masters of Albion , is going to be his last. \"Masters of Albion is a redemption title for me,\" said Molyneux. \"But also, it's my last game.

Unity is urging users to update their software as a new security vulnerability has been spotted in Unity versions 2017.1 and later. It's present across versions for Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. Discovered back on June 4 this year , and patched on October 2, this vulnerability meant that users were \"susceptible to an unsafe file loading and local file inclusion attack depending on the operating system.\" This means someone could enable local code execution or grab information at \"the privilege level of the vulnerable application\". It was given a high severity score by Unity and a CVSS score of 8.4. With 10 being the most severe, this vulnerability is quite significant. Unity does clarify that \"there is no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability nor has there been any impact on users or customers.\" Games or applications released using version 2017.1 or later may contain this vulnerability, and creators are encouraged to download the patched update of Unity via the Unity Hub or Unity Download Archive .

That's the reason for a device such as this one from Ampinel, which keeps a graphics card's power demands in check across the compact 12VHPWR and 12V-2X6 connectors. The Ampinel from aqua computer is a small device that connects to a graphics card's power connector. It's compatible with any GPU using the modern 16-pin connector, ie most of the RTX 40- and 50-series cards. It works by monitoring the current and voltage being delivered to a graphics card, though unlike other devices that do much the same thing, it actively distributes load across the connector to ensure no single pin is overloaded. If you think back to the initial testing of the 12VHPWR connector, which was redesigned with the 12V-2X6 standard due to failure rates, it was shown that the power load was not being distributed evenly across the entire connector. This, in some cases, leading to single pins on the connector melting due to overheating. The Ampinel prevents such an issue occuring. It does so through a few things: firstly, monitoring each of the six power channels; secondly, redistributing the load should any single channel exceed the maximum current that they are r…",

Until now, most advances in these areas have been discovered through trial and error, but a newly developed mathematical model, backed by experimental evidence, could be used to steer engineers in the right direction for the next generation of batteries. That's according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in a report on research carried out by a team of engineers, mathematicians, and material scientists. Specifically, the study investigated the process of lithium-ion intercalation , the electrochemical schenanigans that take place in the batteries we use in watches, phones, and pretty much anything these days. When you charge up the batteries in such devices, lithium ions are driven from an electrolytic solution and jammed into a solid electrode by a voltage source. This process has been intensively studied over the years, and battery designers have typically resorted to using the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation to predict the behaviour of lithium-ion cells. However, the BV formula is…",

Who says the capitalist class never does anything for you? You can find the full list below, but the big-ticket items here as far as I'm concerned are Fallout: New Vegas (either the best or second-best Fallout game, depending on what day you catch me) and Fallout 3 (slightly worse than Fallout 4; come at me).

I suspect the timing here might just be deliberate: the very good Fallout TV show, brought to you by Amazon, is set to hit on December 17 this year, and Lucy and the gang are set to head to New Vegas itself.
