    "body": "There's a class of board game so complex that even successfully completing a game becomes a heroic accomplishment of logistics and human endurance. Among the most revered of those offerings is Twilight Imperium, the legendary sci-fi strategy game of galactic conquest, commerce, and political scheming that's earned its place as the 6th highest rated game on BoardGameGeek —and its 4.34 / 5 complexity rating. Soon it'll be a bit easier to enter the arena of galactic grand strategy without an Olympic swimming pool-sized dining table, because Twilight Imperium is coming to Steam. (Image credit: Red Square Games) Twilight Imperium Digital is a full mechanical adaptation of the 4X board game's 4th Edition rules, featuring all of the base game's 17 factions and their associated features. \"Twilight Imperium Digital brings the galaxy-spanning conflict and deep political intrigue of the classic board game to life like never before—streamlined for the digital space but retaining the depth, complexity, and iconic feel fans love,\" developer and publisher Red Square Games said in a press release.

One of the developers heavily affected was Zenimax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO), which saw the cancellation of an MMO codenamed Blackbird alongside an unspecified number of layoffs.

Okay, yes, some version of that happens in a lot of MMOs, but it's a particular thorn in the side for Jagex and its players, leading as it does to legions of bots infesting the game in order to vacuum up gold to sell later on. Now, Jagex has decided it's no more Mr Nice Guy time: the punishments for buying gold are getting harsher. \"Buying gold off a real world trader is already very clearly against the rules, but historically we've treated the buyers more leniently than the sellers when issuing penalties for real world trading,\" said Jagex in a post earlier today . But no longer: \"As part of our clamp-down on those gold-farming bots and the harm they do to Old School RuneScape, we're now taking a harsher line against players caught buying gold from them.\" In other words, don't expect to get away with a slap on the wrist just because you were only buying gold or an in-game item from …",

One Founders Edition BIOS and a modified Nvidia driver later, and Substantial-Mark-959 says they've been able to get the card up and running. The GPU-Z readout makes for some interesting reading, showing 4480 shaders, 96 ROPs, and 280 TMUs—oh, and 12 GB of VRAM, a whole gigabyte more than the released card.

That's where the best XP farms come in, netting you heaps of experience to level up fast and with less effort, so you can focus on your favourite bits. If it's your first run through the campaign, I'd generally recommend just completing the story and exploring the open world—there's little reason to grind before then. Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters . Best Borderlands 4 XP farms The two best ways to farm XP in Borderlands 4 are to complete bounty contracts and grind drill site activities , with the latter being even better when you're playing in co-op. Both options also give you tons of money and loot (there are vending machines to sell items nearby, too), including unique legendary gear, so you'll be getting more than just XP. …",

The only N2 chips AMD has planned for next year, as far as we know, are server CPUs, not GPUs. AMD's next major AI GPU release, MI450 , is expected to be on TSMC N3 silicon. Nvidia currently uses a version of TSMC's N4 node for all its GPUs. N4 is actually a refinement of N5, which dates back to 2020. Meanwhile, the first chip made on TSMC's N3 technology, the Apple A17 Pro SoC for iPhones, debuted back in 2023. Consequently, Nvidia is now bumping up against what's known as the reticle limit with its Blackwell generation of GPUs .

The Zenaim Arcade Controller Button Module Kit (via PC Watch ) is set to launch in Japan on September 25 for 29,700 yen which, according to Google's currency conversion, works out to $202 at the time of writing.

Below, I'll go over where to find each of the vault key fragments and their respective vaults.

For a game that is so reliant on routine inventory management, Borderlands 4 has somehow managed to massively cock it up.

This is coming from someone who isn't even massively fussy when it comes to clean inventory management. I just want two things: make it quick, and make it easy. Borderlands 4 does neither.

The creator of this... thing is YouTuber Ancient , who's been iterating on a \"sphere o' mouths\" concept for robot lip-syncing (via Hackaday ). Essentially, it's a custom designed, 3D-printed ball of various mouth shapes, mounted inside a doll's head and spun in various configurations so only one mouth is visible through the gaping maw in the front at any one time. (Image credit: Ancient) A stepper motor attached to a mechanism inside the frame spins the ball under the control of a Raspberry Pi, and the horrifying... I mean, intriguing result you see at the end of the video above is the result of part automation, part manual lip syncing to a selection of tunes.

According to the settlement , you could be entitled to compensation if you bought, \"any Corsair DDR-4 (non-SODIMM/laptop) memory product with a rated speed over 2133 megahertz (MHz) or any Corsair DDR-5 (non-SODIMM/laptop) memory product with a rated speed over 4800 megahertz, and made that purchase while living in the United States, and the purchase(s) occurred between January 14, 2018 and July 2, 2025.\" The initial terms say that proof of purchase isn't necessary, but without it claimants are limited to compensation for five products. Compensation will be on a pro-rata basis. In other words, there isn't a fixed compensation amount per claim, instead the $5.5 million sum will be divided among the successful claimants.

Here's a man with no patience for nonsense. But perhaps even Sapkowski cracked a smile when he learnt he was getting Poland's Gold Gloria Artis Medal for Merit to Culture, which the country's Ministry of Culture hands out to artists who have made major contributions to its heritage. Well, with his new gold medal (which you can see up-close on the Wiki page , and which wouldn't look out of place in The Witcher itself) Sapkowski is now among the most hallowed of those ranks. He was given the medal by Polish culture minister Marta Cienkowska and, judging by the photos, immediately erupted into a gregarious bout of dancing, laughing, and merrymaking. No, just kidding.

In an update published today to Pocketpair's various social media channels to announce two main things: that it's resolved to put out Palworld's 1.0 version in 2026, and that doing that means there probably won't be any huge updates for the rest of 2025. \"Beyond just adding new content, there's a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access,\" says Pocketpair community director Bucky in the announcement video. \"It's no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start this cleanup this year.\" And then comes the bad news, though frankly I doubt anyone will be too upset about it, given what Bucky just said. \"It means that things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year.

Nearline HDDs are ones used for infrequently accessed data, acting neither as cold (long-term) nor hot (rapidly accessible) storage but something in between. They're primarily used for data such as backups. The AI boom has meant there's more of this storage in demand than before, to keep previous AI training data and model roll-backs, for instance. One recent example of this increased demand comes from Western Digital. The company recently split from its SSD arm, Sandisk, to focus entirely on HDDs. TrendForce relays a notice from the company that was \"spotted by industry sources\" and explains that there is \"unprecedented demand for every capacity in our portfolio.\" Consequently, WD \"will be gradually implementing price increases on all HDD products, effective immediately.\" It will also expand its \"use of ocean freight\", which will increase transport time by a few weeks but \"significantly r…",

There are well over 100 legendary gear items in Borderlands 4, and the Hot Slugger should be near the top of your list, no matter which character you're playing.

Those numbers put Borderlands 4 at #46 on the list of all-time highest Steam concurrent peaks , just below Elden Ring Nightreign, and Silksong all the way up at #17, sandwiched between Apex Legends and Path of Exile 2. I don't like to fixate too much on Steam concurrents as a measure of popularity, as they don't tell the whole story, but they are one of few direct windows into what gamers are doing that we have, and this particular figure underlines just how colossal of a success Silksong has been.

It got the job done, but it was nowhere close to the power of YouTuber Syrobe's \"easy mode\" build where you have an endless supply of powerful tools. Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it. You can pretty much equip any tools you want, but Syrobe recommends the Tacks, Silkshot, and the Voltvessels. He adds in the Pollip Pouch so every hit applies …",

As the dust settles, we're now getting our first estimates for just how many copies Silksong has sold. In its game discovery newsletter , games industry analyst firm GameDiscoverCo estimates based on available data that Hollow Knight: Silksong has already sold more than 3.2 million copies on Steam. Additionally, GameDiscoverCo reckons it's been downloaded approximately 1.5 million times through Xbox Game Pass, though it's unclear how many of those downloads were distributed between console and PC. For an indie release from a relatively small production team, that's a phenomenal success, particularly when compared with other Metroidvanias. Silksong's in a genre with no shortage of enthusiasts, but Metroidvanias aren't what we'd typically consider as having mass market appeal. Comparing Steam sales numbers against other games released this year with the Metroidvania tag, GamesDiscoverCo says \"Silksong's dominance is striking.\" U…",

But I've been a fool: despite using the attack in multiple boss fights, I actually haven't been getting as much damage out of it as I could've. Thanks to a PSA video from Jason Mondal on YouTube, I only just learned how to use Thread Storm to its full potential. Instead of pressing or holding right bumper on a controller once to activate the ability, you can rapidly mash the button to extend its duration without using more silk, giving you more damage per cast. The only downside is that this leaves you vulnerable to a counterattack for longer, but that's kind of the basic tradeoff of Thread Storm already. My preferred deployment is at a diagonal, up and slightly to the side of a boss to get them in the AOE while having a good chance of avoiding any attacks.

The entire build revolves around throwing knives that cause your normal damage to become critical damage. You can find the \"Penetrator Augment - Damage\" stat on any Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife in the game and it'll work regardless of the item's level. NickTew's character is level 50 and his level 35 knife works because the stat is the same no matter what. Vex has a passive skill called Bloodletter that gives your guns a chance to apply a bleed damage over time effect. That bleed will deal critical hits when combined with the throwing knife, which is a lot of damage on its own. But where this goes infinite is w…",

So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on.

No Link : Steam If the \"What Is This Thing?\" subreddit existed in the Edwardian era, it'd be a quiet little curio shop called Strange Antiquities. As a temp shopkeeper filling in for the local thaumaturge, I sit behind a desk and spend my rainy days puzzling over bizarre artifacts to determine what they are and what they do. A glass bottle containing a single glowing strand of hair suspended in blue liquid. An iron claw clutching black gemstone covered in blood-red streaks. Grotesque wooden figurines, several items that appear to be severed hands, a silver pendant with a green eyeball in the center that rolls to follow my every movement. What are these things? Fans of Bad Viking's first shopkeeping puzzle adventure, Strange Horticulture, will feel right at home in the gloomy yet cozy occult shop solving the little mysteries surrounding each artifact, dozens and dozens of them, over the course of about 12 hours.

Preparing for the release of Wheatflour Wonderland will also prevent any unnecessary obstacles getting in the way of your budding friendship with Cogimyun, the game's newest character. Since friendship progression is limited to how much you can craft per day, anyone looking to blast through the new set of friendship quests will want to give themselves a headstart.

In the case of Battlefield 2042 , the last instalment in the series, Battlefield Studios has been able to look at it and go, 'Yeah, we won't do that again' when it comes to laying the groundwork for Battlefield 6 . Battlefield 2042 isn't looked back on very fondly by players. Its futuristic setting robbed players of the usual gritty and grounded setting of previous Battlefield games, and it took chances on new ideas that didn't land well. One such being 128-player matches.

Because we like it, but then players don't—and in the end, we are subservient to the players, we do what the players want.\" 128-player matches in Battlefield 2042 proved to be a tad too much for players to get to grips with .

On the one hand, I dropped 800 or so quid on it and it carried on chugging for a decade. On the other hand, it really kept me on my toes throughout the back half of its lifespan. Point being, a first gaming laptop is a momentous event, so can the Erazer Scout rise to the occasion? Well, the first major caveat to get out of the way is that this sub-brand of German consumer electronics company Medion (which itself is a member of the Lenovo group) does not currently sell outside of the UK and Europe. So, US-based readers looking longingly at that budget price tag are out of luck, I'm afraid. The second thing to bear in mind is that this gaming laptop contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 mobile GPU, an entry-level chip that, in desktop form, only promises performance comparable to the RTX 4060 , though you do get DLSS 4. Even without upscaling, this plucky little RTX 5050 gaming laptop still managed to squeeze out just a few more frames in gaming benchmarks than my actual rig , the iBuyPower RDY Y40 Valorant VCTA R003 desktop .
