Greene A sideways spiral galaxy shines in this NASA/ESA&nbsp; Hubble Space Telescope &nbsp;image. Located about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo (the Maiden), NGC 4388 is a resident of the Virgo galaxy cluster. This enormous cluster of galaxies contains more than a thousand members and is the nearest large galaxy cluster to the Milky Way. NGC 4388 appears to tilt at an extreme angle relative to our point of view, giving us a nearly edge-on prospect of the galaxy. This perspective reveals a curious feature that wasn’t visible in a&nbsp; previous Hubble image of this galaxy &nbsp;released in 2016: a plume of gas from the galaxy’s nucleus, here seen billowing out from the galaxy’s disk toward the lower-right corner of the image. But where did this outflow come from, and why does it glow? The answer likely lies in the vast stretches of space that separate the galaxies of the Virgo cluster. Though the space between galaxies appears empty, this space is occupied by hot wisps of gas called the intracluster med…",

It has a larger 1.3-inch display with slimmer bezels, up to 14 days of battery life, two microphones, and step/sleep tracking. Pre-orders begin today for $199, with shipping starting in May. 2025 was a surprisingly big year for Pebble fans. Last March, former Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky unexpectedly launched two new Pebble smartwatches : the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

Meanwhile, over on the Billboard 200 albums chart, noteworthy No. 26-peaking collections include John Denver and the Muppets’ warm and fuzzy (literally) A Christmas Together , P!nk’s debut, Can’t Take Me Home , and 2022’s Elvis soundtrack.

After repeatedly slamming Donald Trump last year for everything from his controversial gold-plated White House makeover and East Wing demolition to the President&#8217;s &#8220;vile,&#8221; hate-filled obituary for beloved moviemaker Rob Reiner, White has not held his tongue when it comes to calling out the divisive rhetoric and actions of Trump 2.0. The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer was at it again this week when he took aim at U.S. Rep Tim Burchett after the Congressman from White&#8217;s home state of Tennessee shared a misleading AI-generated video that appeared to show the &#8220;Seven Nation Army&#8221; star telling Trump supporters to not listen to his music. While X flagged Burchett&#8217;s original post as containing fake footage using quotes falsely attributed to White (with the links to those videos seemingly deleted from the first version), the 61-year-old Republican who has served Tennessee&#8217;s second congressional district since 2019 doubled down in his accompanying message, which tauntingly read: &#8220;That cute girl from the Addams Family got really u…",

The phone adds Proton apps inside a locked-down Vault, while still allowing wider app access through a Wild Web section. Pricing starts at €699 with one year of service included, followed by a paid subscription for AphyOS features. Swiss phone maker Punkt is back at CES 2026 with a familiar message and a slightly more refined pitch. The company has unveiled the MC03, its latest privacy-focused smartphone, aimed at people who want more control over how their phone behaves and how much data it shares. All without completely abandoning modern apps and services. The MC03 builds on the idea behind the earlier MC02 , but Punkt says this new model is more clearly split into two areas. There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows.

In papers filed with a California district court, Taylor’s reps accuse Jamie Nelson&nbsp;of unauthorized commercial exploitation of images originally snapped for Vogue Portugal. The photos, part of the so-called “Champagne Problems” series, were published in July 2025, and have been shared widely on social media. However, prints remain for sale through Nelson&#8217;s website, with prices ranging from $1,500 up to $3,600, reduced from $4,000. The series is a “visual dialogue between two kindred spirits,” reads Nelson&#8217;s page, both “fiercely embodying defiance, glamour, and authenticity.” The shoot took place at Nelson’s “iconic vintage pink palace in Los Angeles,” and captures Taylor’s take-no-prisoner’s punk spirit, and wicked sense of Aussie humor. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , the court documents include a portion of a letter sent by the band’s manager Simone Ubaldi, co-director of Sundowner Artists, to Nelson, addressing the commercialization of those p…",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung has announced the Freestyle+, a refreshed version of its portable projector, ahead of CES 2026. The update brings more brightness and smoother automatic setup, while keeping the same familiar design. The Freestyle+ will be showcased at CES 2026, with global availability expected later in 2026. As CES 2026 approaches, the projector category is shaping up for a busy few days. Samsung, however, isn’t waiting for Vegas to make moves. Today, the company announced the Freestyle+, a refreshed version of its popular portable projector. If you’ve followed the Freestyle line since its debut, the new model will look familiar. The Freestyle+ sticks with the same compact, self-contained design as previous models, complete with a cylindrical body and 180-degree rotating stand. The flexible setup still allows the projector to throw an image onto walls, floors, or ceilings, and it’s still easy to move from room to room without much effort.",

If you’re like me, it’s extremely helpful to visually track these goals, write them down, and see the progress you’re making along the way. I’ve tried many versions of this over the years, but in 2025, I used three apps I found super helpful, each with a unique approach.",

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority If you’ve considered building or upgrading a PC lately, you’ve likely noticed the shockingly high price of memory . RAM kits that sold for reasonable sums just a year ago now routinely cost two to three times as much, and prices continue to rise while some sets are increasingly challenging to obtain entirely. Smartphone owners may feel insulated from these swings, since we don’t buy or install mobile RAM ourselves. However, the same forces driving up PC memory prices are quietly reshaping the smartphones we may plan to purchase next year. Here’s what you need to know.",

There is currently a split between “visible AI” (the chatbots we communicate with) and “invisible AI” (the magical features many don’t realize use AI), but the heavy lifting is often done remotely. This split has contributed to AI fatigue, as users see high-end NPUs as expensive overkill for features that require an internet connection anyway.",

    "body": "Credit: Guest Post / Android Authority Google’s ecosystem has quietly become the backbone of my everyday workflow. From jotting down quick ideas in Google Keep to drafting articles in Docs or unwinding on YouTube, I rely on Google’s tools more than I sometimes realise. These apps follow me everywhere, slipping into my day-to-day routine without much thought — until I actually stopped and considered how much I depend on them. That moment came recently when I started thinking about moving away from Google’s services. It wasn’t because I disliked them; I was simply curious whether I could simplify my setup or reduce my reliance on one company. But as someone who reviews multiple smartphones every year — and constantly switches between iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac — it didn’t take long to realise that walking away from Google would make my workflow significantly more chaotic.",

Reading mode has been available in Chrome on Android for a while, but using it has never been particularly reliable. It only appeared on certain pages , relied on Chrome deciding whether an article qualified, and could vanish just as quickly as it showed up, which made it easy to forget the feature existed at all.

We first heard that Apple hardware design veteran Jony Ive was working with OpenAI to create some kind of AI-powered device more than a year ago, but we haven’t heard much about what that device will actually be. Today, a new report includes some key details about the project, which could be some kind of AI-integrated pen. According to a tweet from industry tipster Smart Pikachu , OpenAI’s forthcoming gadget will “likely” be produced by Foxconn, the contract manufacturer that assembles products like the iPhone and recent Pixel phone models. The tweet goes on to say that the initiative could take the shape of “a pen” and/or “a ‘to-go’ audio device.”",

The event is expected to take place a little later this time, with the Galaxy S26 reveal reportedly pushed back a few weeks. Today, though, a new leak is giving us a good idea of what the phones’ finalized hardware will look like. According to a couple of posts by OnLeaks on Twitter , the Galaxy S26 series will look more than a little like the Galaxy S25 series. One notable difference, though, is that the forthcoming phones’ camera bumps will look like the ones on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones, with three individual camera lenses enclosed in a pill-shaped camera bump.",

The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers. We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",

The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster.

    "body": "TL;DR The PicPak is a compact photo frame utilizing a color E Ink display. The company claims it can store more than 500 photos and offer up to 400 days of battery life on a single charge. Early crowdfunders can order a PicPak for around $49 on Kickstarter. As color E Ink continues to try to escape the shadow of e-readers , the PicPak is the latest attempt to see where else the technology can go. The tiny E Ink display acts as a trendy, miniature digital picture frame you can fill up and forget about, thanks to extended battery life and storage for more than 500 images. In other words, it may just be the low-maintenance answer to the constant question of what to do with all the photos sitting in your camera roll.

    "body": "TL;DR TCL’s Note A1 NXTPAPER has officially launched, positioning between E-Ink tablets and traditional LCD slates. Key specs include an 11.5-inch 120Hz NXTPAPER Pure display, MediaTek G100 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and stylus support. It will retail for $549 starting in February, but is available now at a discount on Kickstarter for early adopters. TCL’s Note A1 NXTPAPER has officially launched today with a full spec sheet. New details reveal what makes the device stand out and help clarify its place in the current market. Rather than competing head-on with minimalist E-Ink tablets or fully fledged tablets, it’s designed to be faster and more flexible than E-Ink, but still easier on the eyes than a typical LCD slate. At the center, the device’s 11.5-inch NXTPAPER Pure display uses a 3:2 aspect ratio with a 2200 × 1440 resolution. It supports 16.7 million colors, reaches 300 nits of typical brightness, and refreshes at up to 120Hz, giving it a clear responsiveness advantage over E-Ink alternatives. TCL says the display is flicker-free, reflection-resistant, and TUV-certified for eye comfort. This reinforces that the Note A1 is meant for long reading and writing sess…",

Leaks so far paint a disappointing picture for the Galaxy S26 , but Samsung seems to have grander plans for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. While the camera hardware may remain unchanged for yet another year, Samsung could be working on enhancing the camera experience with features such as reduced lens flare , support for professional lens controllers , APV codec , and more.

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit.

Even after years of being outclassed by other rivals, Samsung refuses to give up on its smart assistant, Bixby . Now that all smart assistants are being upgraded with AI, Samsung has similar expectations for Bixby, too. But instead of developing a solution in-house, the tech giant is partnering with an OpenAI rival to execute complex commands given to Bixby, in a similar fashion to how Apple has integrated ChatGPT into Siri . Samsung has seemingly begun experimenting with Bixby powered by Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT rival that takes a research-first approach, accessing the web and blending other LLMs for responses. This integration was first mentioned last month by a leaker and now appears to be taking form. Based on a screenshot shared by user @achultra on X (via SammyGuru ), Bixby appears to be delivering some responses powered by Perplexity.",

That’s pretty long range, and as a very, very, very amateur astronomer, I wondered whether OPPO’s lens kit would be a gateway to some even more amateur astrophotography. Given the rise of brilliant camera phones , computational photography, and dedicated astrophotography modes, I set out to answer whether smartphones are finally catching up to entry-level telescopes for casual sky-watching. Before I braced myself for the cold, I did some quick math to set my expectations. “My Newtonian telescope has a 750 mm focal length, just bright enough to make out nebulae and galaxies on a dark night, such as Andromeda, with a 28mm lens (27x magnification).",

Pixel 7 and older still have the older interface, even with the latest Pixel Camera update. Google debuted an updated panorama camera mode on the Pixel 9 that guides users through the process of creating a panorama shot using an intuitive AR-style interface. The feature had been exclusive to Pixel 9 and 10 until this week, but it’s now available on Pixel 8, too. As spotted by 9to5Google , the latest version of the Pixel Camera app adds the new and improved panorama mode to Pixel 8 series phones. Pixel 7 and older can also take panorama shots, but they do not currently have access to the updated UI introduced on Pixel 9 last year.",

Moreover, routers haven’t become easier to use or included any exciting new features in the past decade. In fact, I’ve been disappointed by the lack of innovation by companies like Google that have only gone as far as making smartphone apps for easier setup or improving mesh connectivity. So when I came across the Beryl AX — a Wi-Fi router claiming to disrupt the status quo on both, price and features — it piqued my interest. The device in question comes from a relatively young manufacturer, GL.iNet, that has mostly built its reputation on compact routers over the past few years. And on paper, it’s quite the disruptor: it can fit in a pocket, has 2.5Gbit Ethernet, uses USB-C for power, and packs more useful software features than routers that cost hundreds of dollars.",

    "body": "TL;DR Right now, changing your Gmail address lies somewhere between being impossible and a giant headache. In a newly update Hindi support doc, Google reports that it’s changing this, and will let you choose a new address without losing any data. Changes will be limited to once a year, and only three times total. A new year can be a chance to reinvent yourself, whether that’s learning a new skill, getting in shape, or trying out a new look. And while you’ve got no shortage of options there, some changes are just beyond our reach — like say, for example, if you wanted to change your Gmail address. You can always sign up for a new account , sure, and maybe even set up forwarding from your old address, but there’s no clean way to just change from one Gmail address to another. But that looks like it could all be about to change. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
