I'm getting paid, so it's not a problem for me personally, but because my output isn't being released to the public, people see me as not working.\" While that's particularly disappointing for anyone hoping for more Yoko Taro-brand weirdness, the Nier creator is just one of many game developers who've recently had to watch their work evaporate. 2025 has continued a years-long rash of game cancellations, studio closures, …",

Joseph O'Connor, now 26 years old, hijacked over 130 accounts, including those of Apple, Uber, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Kanye West. Alongside other hackers, three of whom have been charged, they then impersonated the companies / individuals in question and used the accounts to promote a classic \"double your money\" scam. The hijacked accounts would send tweets asking followers to send Bitcoin to digital wallets, promising that the money would be doubled and returned. An estimated 350 million Twitter users viewed these dodgy tweets and, over 15-16 July 2020, a total of 426 transfers totalling 12.86 Bitcoin was made to the wallets. This would have been worth around $110,000 in 2020: now the value would be more like $1.2 million. The hack itself, as they often are, was more down to social engineering than cyber genius. The group persuaded a handful of Twitter employees to hand over their internal login details, through which they gained access…",

Well, Microsoft appears to be doing that something, as it's laid out its latest anti-cheating features alongside the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 . Microsoft's four-pronged attack on cheating has two points you'll likely already be familiar with. The first is a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, which many of you will recognise from the whole Windows 11 unsupported machine upgrade fiasco . The second is Secure Boot, which you may also recognise from the Battlefield 6, err, fiasco , as it needs to be properly enabled on your machine before you can play the game. The third is Virtualization-based Security (VBS), which is used to keep vital parts of Windows (like the kernel) in an isolated environment. Microsoft says developers using VBS as part of their anti-cheating solution can have \"greater certainty that cheats are not interfering with fair game play.\" The fourth is called Remote Attestation .

The patch seems like a sensible response to some general criticisms of the acclaimed horror revival. But fans of the series are convinced that the update originated from a much more specific source—the game's lead actor. Japanese actor and model Konatsu Kato lends her voice and likeness to protagonist Shimizu Hinako in Silent Hill f. But Kato has also been livestreaming her own playthrough of the game since October, fulfilling a promise she made to fans earlier in the month. Her streams have since gone viral, with the VODs of her streams receiving millions of views on YouTube . As reported by Automaton Media, part of the reason behind the popularity of Kato's streams is her specific journey with the game. More than just being about her reactions and opinions, Kato is not a regular gamer, so Silent Hill f has proved a bit of a baptism of fire for her.

Even if you're a gigachad who's unruffled about finding a Leddy, picking it up in the tutorial could net you a cool two million rubles to kickstart the game. It's good enough that when I found it for myself during my tutorial for the game's PvP mode, I immediately reset my PvE account and went to grab it for myself. So, how do you get said LEDX? If you're about to start the Escape From Tarkov tutorial, or you are considering wiping your account just to grab it, here's what you need to do, plus some other handy items to grab during the tutorial: 1. Go through the tutorial (Image credit: Battlestate Games) You'll start the tutorial by dusting yourself off in the Terragroup Building in Ground Zero.

There are a few significant tweaks here, but the things that stand out to me are: yet more fixes for the game's A-Life system and a whole new difficulty. That's in descending order of importance, so far as I'm concerned. The A-Life fixes sound a lot more interesting than GSC's prosaic \"Fixes and improvements to the A-Life system\" makes it sound. If you're not familiar, A-Life is the name GSC gives to the systems in all its Stalker games that, more or less, let the games' beasts and NPCs pursue independent lives and objectives. It's always kind of an illusion, but it's an illusion that many felt was especially lacking in Stalker 2 at launch.

Probably the biggest tribute I can pay Phasmophobia, though, is that it's still on my SSD. I don't play it all the time, but it's one of those games where someone suggests it as a palate-cleanser after some sweaty PVP, and everyone's instantly on-board.

The Steam reviews tell their own story: approximately 340,000 of them have it sitting pretty at \" overwhelmingly positive .\" Kinetic's clearly doing something right and, at the recent launch event for a comprehensive rework of Nell's Diner , CEO Daniel Knight and art director Corey Dixon told PCGN that dodging the usual live service trappings is kinda the point. \"[Live service] has definitely changed players' expect…",

We wanted to focus on the horror and horror be the main part.\" (Image credit: Capcom) Playing as Grace Ashcroft, a technical analyst for the FBI, those of us brave enough to wade into Requiem won't get the comfort of an unshakable protagonist. While she does know how to handle a gun, Grace isn't a fighter and therefore must run away from all the monsters that you'll find lurking around. This was actually the predominant reason as to why Leon Kennedy doesn't return as our protagonist —he's just too cool. \"With Requiem, we decided to make sure it was scary until the end,\" Kumazawa co…",

It's not as though Wilds hasn't earned its licks—persistent performance issues have utterly marred the game's reception on PC , and unlike most games where this generally improves over time, Wilds has only gotten worse for the lion's share of players. That's despite the fact that the game is pretty solid otherwise. But playability is important, and Capcom has absolutely been dragging its feet on fixing it . We'll just have to see if December's promised improvements will actually drag Wilds out of the dumpster it's spent the last few months thrashing about in.

Disappeared and absconded without so much as a how'd-you-do. As of November 11 (per SteamDB ), Cold Fear has been yoinked from Steam. The timing here is notable: back in August, the game slipped out of Ubisoft's hands and into Atari's, along with four other titles—I Am Alive, Child of Eden, Grow Home, and Grow Up. \"We're excited to reintroduce these titles while also exploring ways to expand and evolve these franchises,\" Atari head honcho Wade Rosen said at the time . Those other games are still available (save Child of Eden, which was never on PC). An obvious question arises: with Nightdive in Atari's embrace , has the studio been put to work on some kind of gussied-up version of the two-decade-old shooter? It'd be an odd choice. Or, well, I think so anyway. Cold Fear's Very Positive reviews on Steam will inform you that the game has its dedicated shooters even today, but the game's critical reception at launch was pretty lukewarm—a strange addition to Nightdive's line-up of polished classics. Then again, this is the studio th…",

Things have been improving , slowly but surely, with Creative Studio 3 seemingly keen to experiment and shake things up after years of a stale, sluggish formula—and it looks like those efforts are continuing. That's per an interview with Korean outlet Inven , wherein Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) spoke on the subject. I should note that the following quotes are machine-translated, so the exact meaning is to be taken with a grain of salt, but it certainly looks like Yoshi-P's working on something big: \"Final Fantasy 14 is now moving forward into its next decade.

The first hint that Requiem was first intended to be an entirely different game came from producer Masato Kumazawa (via Press Start ): \"So looking back on the online multiplayer game, it’s been in development for around six years or so.\" (Image credit: Capcom) While it's a surprising origin story, I can't say I'm surprised. Capcom has been tinkering with the idea of Resident Evil-inspired online multiplayer games for a while now. Some of the games, like RE5 and RE6, had co-op in the campaigns, while Revelations had Raid Mode, which could be played in online co-op. Re: Verse was the most recent attempt at an online multiplayer RE-inspired game, although that didn't end very well . \"Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild,\" Kumazawa says. \"However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play.

Responding to the social media post that triggered the debate on X (via Eurogamer ) Khanna stated: \"We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. They should share in the profits. And there should be a tax on mass displacement.\" This is not a new position for Khanna, who has been calling for regulations on how generative AI is both created and deployed in the US. In an interview with the Verge last year , Khanna provided a detailed explanation of his position on AI.

    "body": "The idea of \"canonicity\" in RPGs is an odd one, given the whole point of both videogame and tabletop RPGs is that the players decide what the main characters do. But sequels, spin-offs, and sourcebooks have a habit of choosing particular outcomes as the \"real\" ones—unless it's the Elder Scrolls, where every ending of Morrowind happened at once. Baldur's Gate 3 had to deal with characters from Baldur's Gate 2 having canonical events happen to them between games, like Minsc and Boo being turned to stone or Viconia and Saarevok backsliding into evil, and now the cast of Baldur's Gate 3 are in the same boat. The latest Forgotten Realms supplements, Adventures in Faerûn and Heroes of Faerûn, move the timeline on from 1492—when BG3 happens—to 1501, and hint at the fates of its cast. Quotes from Karlach crop up throughout Adventures in Faerûn and she appears more than once in the art for both books alongside Astarion, Shadowheart, and Minsc. And in none of those illustrations is she a mind flayer or a pile of ash—two of the potential outcomes for her in Baldur's Gate 3. The best ending for Karlach is that she returns to Avernus with the Infernal Engine still burning away inside her chest…",

The trailer starts out looking like it could almost be a Witcher spinoff: The UI, music, voices, even the way the medieval city resembles Novigrad all smacked me in the face. Junior cadet vampire Coen has Geralt's signature messy high ponytail (but in brunette), and he also shares a name with a prominent book witcher absent from the games. The quest in question is a Witcher 3 monster hunt almost to a T: Coen talks to some \"cor blimey\" yokels⁠—with, I do have to say, delightfully craggy, varied, character actor-type faces⁠—who point him in the direction of monster-type happenings to earn access to a cathedral's library. Coen uses the exact same Witcher Senses as Geralt (down to the sepia filter and red outlines!) to uncover a feral vampire's lair, and the beast even cribs the Bruxa scream attack from Blood and Wine. That's not necessarily bad: There hasn't…",

The problem, for PC gamers at least, is that Madness Returns has a pretty rough port that's only gotten harder to work with since its release in 2011; until now, anyway. Modder Wemino has undertaken the noble task of brushing up the port themselves, and released the initial build of their custom MadnessPatch Friday. It's remarkably feature-rich for a fanmade patch: not only does it improve textures, force subtitles to scale correctly above 720p, and adjust the camera for ultrawide resolutions, it also addresses crashes, fixes up broken physics at high framerates, and helps the game run in windowed mode without it throwing a fit. In other words, it's hard to imagine going back to an unmodded build. You might know Wemino from their other excellent patches: EchoPatch for best-in-class horror FPS F.E.A.R. and VorpalFix for the original Alice game, which I used (with great results!) for a recent playthrough.

Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. In-game cosplay is something I've never even thought about but, now I've found it, makes complete sense and I'm shocked I haven't tried it before.

If you couldn't tell from all the things I've written about it, I love videogame music. Even before big-budget studios were employing whole-ass orchestras to perform grand symphonies, composers were making full use of synthesizers and sound chips to create pieces that would've had Beethoven telling all his pals \"Have you heard that One Winged Angel? It's pretty good.\" Videogame music is home to so many bangers that it would be a huge disservice if they were forever confined to the games they were created for, which is where the humble videogame concert comes in. It's a chance to hear your favourite tracks brought to life by an in-person orchestra, often complemented by visuals from the game and maybe even a guest appearance from the composer themselves. To my surprise, the first videogame concert happened far earlier than I ever anticipated—in August 1987 according to GameConcerts , where Dragon Quest composer Koichi Sugiyama presented the Fami…",

But in a year where Call of Duty hasn't been so challenged in arguably well over a decade, largely thanks to Battlefield 6 , it's the small changes that matter just as much as sweeping ones. That said, a co-op campaign, an SBMM-free playlist, more Mastery Camos , Hybrid Combat Specialities, and double jumps are a pretty good list of sizable changes, even if it's not a radical reinvention. That's cool and all, but I'm more hyped about Overclocks, one of the few major upgrades to scorestreaks since Modern Warfare 3 (the first one) introduced point streaks—and it's a callback to the maligned Advanced Warfare of all things.

Broadly, Vein is a familiar affair, plonking you in an open world where civilization has been overrun by zombies and tasking you with staying alive in its sandbox. Like Zomboid, its appeal lies in its high level of granularity, with players able to interact with pretty much anything in its world.\"Open mailboxes, adjust faucets, and knock on doors,\" the game's Steam page promises, adding \"throw a can of beans at a zombie if you like.\" I do like. But all of this is presented in 3D, with dynamic seasons and highly perceptive undead. Even with a billion zombie survival games out there, you can see why fans of the genre might find Vein appealing.

Primarily, the November update improves Garry's Mod's water visuals, introducing fluid rendering features from more recent Source engine games. As the update's Steam post notes. \"This includes flow maps, lightmaps, and [the] ability to reflect 3D skybox.\" However, Facepunch cautions that the changes \"may unexpectedly affect a small amount of existing maps\" due to some map creators already using modified water materials pulled from newer Source games. \"This is unfortunately unavoidable from our end and will need to be individually fixed by ma…",

But while Dispatch doesn't shy away from nudity, it doesn't go as far as it could have. \"We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn’t have,\" Dispatch writer Pierre Shorette recently told Inverse . \"Maybe folks will get to see those one day.\" That wasn't the only thing they had to cut, with Shorette adding, \"There isn’t anyone on the development team that wouldn't have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game.\" Dispatch's animation is on a level above and beyond what we normally see in videogames, and honestly better than a lot of TV shows.

One topic I wanted to get their thoughts on was optimization: Defect looks like a heavy game, but has surprisingly lenient specs⁠—RTX 2060 minimum⁠—and no mandatory ray tracing like we're starting to see in some games. The graphics arms race is proving ever more costly for devs and players, with diminishing returns: The cutting edge Metal Gear Solid Delta left me feeling cold, especially compared to the similarly photorealistic, yet more vibrant, striking, and ten years older Phantom Pain. Meanwhile, people's champions like Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6 are scoring points with players by not just running on lower-end hardware, but looking and performing well . This isn't just a question of tech and optimization, according to Palalic.\"Good performance in a game isn't always a technical problem, it's as much of an art problem as well,\" he told me. \"A really strong art team can work within any shading and rendering limitations that are presented and lean into those.

I think a lot about trends in MMOs. Probably because I'm being paid to do just that, but also because I think the trends are just plain interesting; we've had a golden age where everyone was trying to make an MMO , tectonic shifts in the kind of things players want to do , and ever-changing social dynamics that keep this aged genre vivid and interesting. One design shift I will never understand, however, is the bizarre affliction that struck MMO designers in the latter half of that 2010s-2020s golden age: The sudden and irrational belief that tab-targeting MMOs (or hotbar MMOs, depending on your accent) are old news, and that every MMO had to have some sort of action combat system in it.

They almost threw me out of the room.\" Former Call of Duty director Glen Schofield is recalling the day he pitched Advanced Warfare's signature mechanic to Activision. As the series entered its second decade, it had already begun to veer away from historical drama and behind-the-headlines espionage. Treyarch was developing drone swarms for Black Ops 2, and Infinity Ward had dared to kick off the singleplayer campaign of Call of Duty: Ghosts in space. (Image credit: Activision) What Schofield was proposing, though, was something different: a futuristic moveset that would interfere with the fundamentals of CoD's sacred multiplayer component. Rather than merely providing novelty in the campaign, the boost jump would change the rules of competitive deathmatch, enabling players to reach high rooftops in newly vertiginous maps, and gain an edge through skilful combination of double jumps and mid-air dashes. If the idea backfired—drawing ire from a community which had grown used to its annualised fix of familiar FPS action—then Activision would be facing a serious threat to its most reliable cash cow. Nonetheless, Advanced War…",
