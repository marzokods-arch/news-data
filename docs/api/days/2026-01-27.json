It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map.

Progression is still a little stagnant for now as Hytale chips away at early access updates, though the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers is more of what I want to see, even if it feels a little underwhelming. With the fancy book, you can summon undead hordes to smack enemies about and take the pressure off yourself. Well, I say horde, but you've got a limited amount of pages to work with. At full capacity, it's more like a small skeletal squad. You can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians. They aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire only seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments.

And I've dedicated the last three years of my life to this project and spent those years getting to know the team, which has become like a family to me.

In a 76-page lawsuit filed in the US District Court of Rhode Island last week (via GoLocalProv ), a group of investors allege that Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks, former Wizards of the Coast president Cynthia Williams, and company executives engaged in \"breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors and/or officers of Hasbro\" by devaluing the Magic brand, even as shareholders raised concerns about the ramifications of overprinting cards and sets. In 2022, the lawsuit says, Bank of America issued a report concluding that Hasbro was \"overproducing Magic cards, which have propped up Hasbro’s recent results but are destroying the long-term value of the brand.\" Despite questioning from shareholders and analysts, however, the lawsuit alleges that the defendants \"repeatedly denied such speculation,\" issuing \"materially false and misleading\" statements during shareholder calls where those concerns were raised.

The channel \"Elden Ring Fights\" is exactly what it says on the tin, and it recently uploaded a banger: Dark Souls' Artorias vs. the bosses of base game Elden Ring . FromSoft dusted off the venerable swordsman to serve as a boss in Elden Ring Nightreign's recent Deathly Forsaken Hollows DLC. He's effectively been \"ported\" to Elden Ring's iteration of the FromSoft game engine, allowing Elden Ring Fights to pit him against the Lands Between's finest. And boy, for a battered veteran coming out of retirement, Artorias fares better than all those tomato cans they kept setting up in front of Jake Paul. Artorias went on an absolutely brutal tear through the bosses of Elden Ring: Early terrors like Margit and Godfrey don't stand a chance, with single hits from Abyss Artie chunking their health bars.

    "body": "It's been just under two weeks since the end of Arc Raiders' Cold Snap event, and Embark isn't wasting any time before rolling into the next phase of feature additions. Today, the studio released details about the Headwinds update arriving this week as the Rust Belt emerges from the depths of winter. And as any farmer's almanac will tell you, the end of winter always brings two things: Asymmetrical combat engagements and an overabundance of avian activity. Truly, the cycle of the seasons is a beautiful thing. (Image credit: Embark Studios) In a news post , Embark offered some details about what to expect when the Headwinds update arrives on January 27. The most impactful addition is a new matchmaking option that'll be available for experienced raiders who've reached level 40: Solo vs Squads, offering bonus XP rewards for lone wolves who're willing to risk a fight with a full pack. Whether or not additional XP is enough of a draw to actually get anyone to choose the new matchmaking option is another question.

Official Highguard promotion stopped as soon as it started, which prompted a swell of spectators (largely on X, the misery app) to declare Highguard the next Concord and question if it would be delayed or cancelled outright. Speaking with Wildlight at a hands-on event in Los Angeles last week, several Highguard devs admitted they wished the reveal had gone down differently, but made it clear that the mixed reception didn't alter their release plans. \"Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better,\" Wildlight Entertainment CEO and founder Dusty Welch told PC Gamer. \"Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand. We, as a team, saw the feedback. We're gamers ourselves. We're online ourselves reading the feedback. \"I think, ultimately, we could have made a different trailer—a better trailer that wasn't about entertaining, which is what we think [T…",

And yet, despite the fact imsims are god's own genre, no one ever makes them. Why? Oh, because they're hard to make and no one buys them? I guess that makes sense. That's my takeaway from a recent chat that Nightdive CEO (and System Shock Remake director) Stephen Kick had with FRVR . \"They don’t perform financially the same way that other genres do,\" said Kick. \"It’s a known fact, you make an imsim game you’re going to be appealing to a very small, niche group of fans that are going to love it, they’re going to be very vocal about it, and they’re going to try to convince their friends to play it, and they may or not be successful.\" That small, niche group of people is me and, I'd hazard to guess, you. But apparently we don't represent a market demographic large enough to move the C-suites of the world. So why does Nightdive keep working on them? Well, it agrees with us: Kick says the team \"don’t generally take in financial performance as a metric for whether or not we work on something or not, but w…",

But there's a significant caveat hanging over the Intel Arc B390, and it goes like this: it's very, very quick— for an iGPU. Sure, it's capable of delivering gaming laptop-like performance, but compare it to any discrete mobile GPU of the current generation and the little graphics tile's limits are quickly revealed. Now, none of this is meant to cast shade upon the considerable achievement of Intel's engineers. No one was expecting its new mobile graphics hardware to compete with, say, anything from the RTX 50-series. In fact, Intel claims the Core Ultra X9 388H is 10% faster at gaming (on average) than a lappy with an RTX 4050 mobile. And, if you squint closely at those claims, you'll see that they were made in reference to a 60 W gaming laptop, with '2x upscaling' enabled.

So consider me downright stupefied that Logitech seems to have raised its price, at least in the US. When I reviewed it, it was going for $100. Now it's going for $120 . To be fair, this is what happened with the original PowerPlay: it started off at $100 and was later raised to $120. But to be equally fair, I don't care, it's still far too expensive considering the downgrade from the first one. In case you don't have a clue what I'm on about, the G PowerPlay pads charge your compatible Logitech mouse—provided it has the charging puck in its underside—simply by resting the mouse on top of it. This means you never have to plug it in to charge ever again. The problem with the second version, though, is it cut back a lot of what made the first so good. In particular, the first one came with two pad toppers rather than one—one hard, one soft.

    "body": "I've just wrapped up my benchmarking of the Intel Core Ultra X9 388H , or more commonly-known to most of you at this point, the top-end Intel Panther Lake mobile chip. It's a feisty little beast, with iGPU performance that feels very close to what you might expect from an entry-level, discrete GPU-equipped gaming laptop—and that gives me hope for a clutch of super-fast handhelds on the horizon. Intel remains tight-lipped regarding handheld implementations of its impressive new chips, with the only word I've heard on the matter being something shown to the public \"soon\". So, I'm left with little but speculation for now. Still, we can have fun dreaming together, can't we? Handheld gaming PCs are currently in a bit of a weird space, as far as I'm concerned. Sure, there are plenty to choose from, but it's quite telling that the Steam Deck still crops up with regularity as one of the top recommendations. Its APU is really starting to show its age in 2026, and while it still makes a fantastic value proposition, I'd primarily recommend it as an indie gaming machine if you're looking for smooth performance. Much faster handhelds are available, of course—but with so many demanding games on…",

Hope you're okay with zombie guts, because the cafeteria's all out of pastrami. (Image credit: Capcom) The three hours of Requiem I played, swapping between a grizzled-but-still-got-it Leon and more fragile newcomer Grace, deftly tiptoed the line between fan service and light touch reinvention. Last time we saw Leon in Resident Evil 4 Remake, Capcom had given him the ability to parry a chainsaw-wielding zombie with his knife, and he's got the same move here with a hatchet—only now when the mad doctor drops his whirring saw it goes skittering down the hallway, blade bouncing off the tile floor. Another zombie picks it up, which is when I realize maybe I can do the same.

Between the two of them, you've now decided that your next gaming laptop is going to be Panther Lake-powered and sport a big GPU from Nvidia, to go with Intel's big Xe3 tile. You're possibly going to be disappointed, then, to know that you're almost certainly not going to see any such lappies coming to market. The reason why is quite simple: it all comes down to the number of available PCIe lanes in the platform controller tile. Intel has two variants of this chiplet: one with 12 lanes (four are Gen 5, eight are Gen 4) and the other with 20 lanes (eight Gen 4, twelve Gen 5). The important thing, though, is that every Core Ultra 300-series processor that has the big 12-core Xe3 iGPU uses the 12-lane platform controller tile. AMD and Nvidia's mobile GPUs are designed to use at least eight PCIe lanes. That doesn't mean you can't fit a discrete GPU alongside a 12-lane PTL chip; it's just that it will leave just four for everything else inside the laptop. The majority of NVMe SSDs require fou…",

However, so far, there's been no confirmation either way on which devices are affected. The document says, \"Microsoft has received a limited number of reports of an issue in which devices are failing to boot with stop code 'UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME', after installing the January 2026 Windows security update ( KB5074109 ), released January 13, 2026, and later updates. Affected devices show a black screen with the message 'Your device ran into a problem and needs a restart. You can restart.'

An adorable little Tamagotchi fella who you could feed and fuss over ahead of every level, before grabbing it like the fat little rodent it is and unleashing it as a weapon of mass destruction. Mochi-O's demo is criminally short—clocking in at just 20 minutes and two levels—but I didn't need much time to fall in love with this weird little game's titular human-hating mecha-hamster. How do I know this lil' guy hates humans? Well, for starters, Mochi-O straight up kills its last owner-slash-wielder-slash-commander. (Image credit: Kodansha) If that wasn't enough confirmation, I got my hands on a rather rudimentary translation device which, when asked \"what do you hate?\" the screen flashed Mochi-O's response: HUMANS HUMANS HUMANS HUMANS HUMANS HUMANS. That's probably a solid enough testimony right there. My job, then, is to not only refine Mochi-O into a weapon of war with upgrades and powerups galore, but to care for it and establish a solid bond through feeding it seeds and giving it plenty of pre-battle scritches. So that, y'know, it doesn't kill me too. It's an odd juxtaposition but a surprisingly ende…",

But no, all we got was a single Ryzen 7 9850X3D announcement and no mention whatsoever of the vaunted dual-CCD 3D V-Cache chip. But a new EEC listing from AMD before the weekend has listed a new Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 processor alongside the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and a bunch of Threadripper chips. (Image credit: EEC) To bring you up to speed, 3D V-Cache is AMD's bespoke technology which underlays an extra chunk of L3 cache underneath the processor cores in a Zen 5 CPU package. The benefit of this is that games in particular benefit from all that extra on-die memory, reducing the number of times programs have to dip into slower system memory and therefore boosting frame rates. On chips, such as the Ryzen 9 9800X3D , and the upcoming 9850X3D, that means all eight of the CPU cores get access to a whole lot more cache. But for the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D chips, which have multiple core complex dies (CCD) to accommodate their higher core counts, only one CCD gets the extra cache. With the…",

Perhaps not. Only time will tell. The good news is that Highguard is free to play, so you won't be short-changed if you're just giving it a spin out of curiosity. When is the Highguard unlock time? Highguard releases today, Monday, January 26 , at 1 pm EST. Although Wildlight Entertainment has yet to officially mention the specific time, it's backed up by the countdown on the Steam store page , syncs with the game's daily countdown social media posts , and coincides with the studio's launch showcase event livestream.

It's difficult for me to take any of that stuff personally because I believe in the art, because I believe in what we've done.

Intrepid explorer Robin Valentine went into Toukana Interactive's latest game expecting a chill, cosy experience similar to Dorfromantik . But he discovered that its cutesy visuals and gentle onboarding belied a game of serious puzzling depth. \"As a puzzle it becomes exponentially tricky. Each asteroid or planet only houses a small number of possible resources, making effective shipping between them vital,\" he wrote in September last year. \"It starts to feel like trying to fit all the components of a circuit board in a functioning layout on the surface of a potato.\" Up to this point, Star Birds' puzzling has been limited to synthetic resource production. Now, though, things are about to get more involved with the addition of organic production chains. Earlier this week, Toukana introduced its Flora & Fauna update to Star Birds, adding alien plants, food production, and a frankly concerning number of tentacles. Much of this revolves around the new star system players can explore. Paradeira is a green and pleasant sector of space bustling with organic life. Primarily, this life can be…",

    "body": "When people call the modern Fallout games \"first-person RPGs\" a part of me dies. A significant chunk of the appeal of them, just like The Elder Scrolls, is the option to flick back and forth between first-person and third-person at the press of a button. When I'm in a cramped tunnel full of ghouls with an air-cooled automatic rifle and a depleting supply of .308 rounds, I want to be in claustrophobic first-person. When I'm jogging across the countryside in a duster, or swinging a golf club at Fiends coming from every direction, I want to be in open third-person. Modders have tended to focus on first-person animations, both because it's the more popular view and the easiest to tweak. Which is why it's taken until now for modder Wombat to bless us with a full third-person animation overhaul for Fallout: New Vegas. And yes, it does cover NPCs as well. Enhanced Animations – 3rd Person Movement is apparently the first in a series of planned Enhanced Animation mods. As Wombat explains, \"It covers all general movement animations when standing, which include idle, walking, running, jumping, and landing animations, all with directional variants. There are also some extra animations for mel…",

One day after the announcement, which included a promise that more \"player-facing generative AI\" was on the cards, Ubisoft shares dropped to their lowest value in more than 14 years . Rubbing some salt in the wound, Reddit posts claiming to come from a developer who worked on the project say that \"it was close to the finish line.\" The redditor, posting under the name SocramVelmar, wrote \"Although the game was close to release, development stopped suddenly due to internal uncertainty and concerns around layoffs. With things unclear, some of the team moved on to other studios that offered more stability.\" If it was close to completion, you may be wondering, why not put in a little more effort to get it out the door? As SocramVelmar explained, \"Because 'close' doesn't always mean 'ready.' At that point the question isn't how much time or money was already spent, it's how much more it would take to ship something the publisher is willing to stand behind.

This is distinct from the irregular preproduction work that came before, as well as the even more blistering, seven days a week schedule he kept during the game's final stretch in 1997. Cain would wake up at 6:00 AM, take care of his cat, then reach the office by 7:00⁠—homemade loaf of bread in hand⁠, recipe helpfully under the video's top comment—to get an early start on coding tasks when there were no meetings to interrupt him. Cain would check in with members of the team at midmorning, excepting the ones who requested to be left alone. Cain's lunch habits⁠—he would return home to make something each day⁠—touch on an economic reality that makes me wish I was born 20 years earlier.

There's been some drama in the World of Warcraft community—I know, we live in a wild and mad world—over its overhauled transmog system , and I can't say it's entirely unwarranted. For the completely uninitiated, 'transmog' is a very fancy MMO lingo word for 'playing dressup', and for World of Warcraft: Midnight, Blizzard's changed the entire economy around how it works. Before this week's pre-patch, players could create and save outfits, which would apply a sort of 'new skin' over their existing gear. If they got a new piece of gear, it'd pop up in their currently-equipped item, requiring them to visit an NPC to re-apply the transmog over it again. That old transmog system is gone: In its place, players are now able to create outfits that will not visibly change as new gear is acquired—with a limited amount of slots they need to unlock with gol…",

That update brought a new mode which is almost my favorite way to play the game now... if it weren't for one critical aspect. A normal match of Deadlock is familiar MOBA fare and is therefore extremely stressful. Games usually last between 20 and 45 minutes, and there's very little downtime as teams vie for objectives and farm creeps. Furthermore, every match is ranked⁠—there's no casual queue. Even if you just want to try a new build and unwind, your lackadaisical performance might be mucking up a teammate's chance to get promoted. This environment is fundamentally hostile to the habitual chiller. Most MOBAs have a chiller-friendly mode based on an old custom game tradition: All Random, All Mid.
