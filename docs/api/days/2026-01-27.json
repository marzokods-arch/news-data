There's nothing wrong with Genshin Impact, but I only need so many open world action RPGs where you meet anime characters you can collect like Pokémon, and most of the copycats don't have anything else going on. Arknights: Endfield , however, does have something else going on: surprisingly robust factory building . I can't name another gacha game where you mine raw materials and process them in a maze of conveyor belts. Factorio always looked like a game I'd never click with, but Endfield has turned me into the kind of person who can spend hours reorganizing their base just to make it slightly more efficient. The problem now is that I like the factory building so much that I'm disappointed when Endfield interrupts it to make me play more of its sad sci-fi Genshin Impact-style adventure with characters that make me want to turn the sound off.

And then presumably you'd be hit with one of its many beam attacks. Unfortunately, the Iron Flask's potential for Poké Ball shenanigans is limited by the fact that it's single use, dashing our collective hopes of collecting our least-favorite NPCs and forcing them to fight the game's most horrible creatures—until this week.

Case in point: comedy adventure Earth Must Die from Size Five Games, which launches today. As noted on its Steam page , the game contains \"an alien orgy depicted as a gyrating lump on the floor,\" and that description seems to have raised at least one questioning eyebrow at Valve HQ. According to publisher No More Robots, Valve needed to know more about this orgy. In fact, Valve needed to see this orgy. For reasons . \"Up until a few days ago, it was unclear if we were actually going to be allowed to launch Earth Must Die on Steam, as Valve had told us that they were 'unable to verify' the context of the alien orgy,\" says the publisher. \"We were required to record and send footage of said orgy for their verification.\" Yes, yes, verification and context.

PC Gamer's Morgan Park was there , and disgraced streamer Guy Beahm, better known to the online world as Dr Disrespect, was not—which might seem like an odd thing to say, except, well, he said he was. The whole baffling story began on January 24, when Beahm posted on X about going to Los Angeles to check out Highguard. The message was accompanied by a photo of strategically-placed gaming peripherals, a \"brain fuel\" drink, a knife for some reason, and a Highguard launch event pass, presumably proof that he was on the scene. (Image credit: Dr Disrespect (Twitter)) This led first to questions about why Wildlight would invite Beahm to the event in the first place. You may recall that he's banned for life from Twitch for, as he put it, messaging a minor in a way \"that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate.\" As it turns out, Beahm was neither invited nor did he attend.

    "body": "The family of a 15-year-old boy who went missing in New York on January 9 have made a public appeal for information to help find the child. Police say Thomas Medlin left his school on that date, boarded a train to the Stony Brook Long Island railroad station, and then went to Grand Central Station, where he was seen on surveillance footage. He hasn't been seen since. Eva Yan, Thomas's mother, told News12 in an interview that detectives believe the boy met someone while playing Roblox online, and subsequently planned to go and meet that person in the city. She added that such behaviour was completely out of character for Thomas. Yan says family and friends are organising search parties across Long Island and the wider city nearly every day. Police add that Thomas’s last known locations were near Cherry and Rutgers streets in Lower Manhattan and later near Sands and Jay Street in Brooklyn, and ask anyone with potential information to contact them (details below). A missing child is a situation with the potential for a tragic ending, and the case remains ongoing, which is why I was stunned to see the Roblox response. Roblox Corporation has now commented on the case via the official R…",

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of children's digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—representing an estimated 14 million consumers in the UK. Very briefly, it alleges that Valve prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms, requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices. Valve had argued that the case should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action on a number of technical grounds, including that it will be difficult to accurately determine who is eligible to claim damages. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (via the BBC ) disagreed, however, declaring that \"the certification criteria were satisfied and it was appropriate to grant a CPO on an opt-out basis.\" A website dedicated to the action at steamyouow…",

Chainalysis puts this down as a 51% increase year-on-year for North Korea, and if accurate that would mean North Korea accounted for just under 60% of all global cryptocurrency theft, estimated at $3.4 billion in 2025. A major factor here was the February 2025 attack on Bybit, which the FBI attributed to North Korea , saying it made off with roughly $1.5 billion worth of digital assets. \"This marks the most severe year on record for DPRK crypto theft in terms of value stolen, with DPRK attacks also accounting for a record 76 percent of all service compromises,\" says the Chainalysis report. North Korean hackers have also stepped up their targeting of individuals, and were behind approximately 160,000 personal wallet attacks over the course of the year, stealing from around 80,000 people.

I'm sorry to tell you that up until yesterday, Fallout: New Vegas has been unforgivably bad. The dirt-worst. This is, of course, because up until yesterday New Vegas had absolutely no bespoke sneaking animation for its canine companion Rex. Unlike the game's human companions, whenever the player dropped into a crouchwalk while accompanied by Rex, the daft mutt would simply… remain standing, plodding along behind you like you were on a jolly in the park and not on a stealth mission of immense importance. No longer. Thanks to a modder named Wombat , Rex's crippling leg-bone issues are a thing of the past. Once you've got Dog Sneak Animations installed, dropping into a crouch (so long as you're out of combat) will have your pooch friend join you, shuffling along the floor flat on his legs like he's sidling up to you to say sorry for eating the sofa cushions. Spiritual leaders are calling it the thing that might finally unite humanity. It is, frankly, rather adorable, and a great entry in that list of mods that fix things you literally n…",

That studio's Warhammer project now lies in the unreleased MMO graveyard, but there is perhaps a silver lining for fans of the genre: Emmert has returned to his old job as CEO of Cryptic Studios, the creator of D&D MMO Neverwinter, Star Trek Online, and Champions Online. On a call with PC Gamer ahead of the announcement, Emmert said that there's no hard feelings between him and NetEase over the Jackalyptic closure—\"strategies change, and I totally get it\"—but that he was \"down in the dumps\" until he got the call asking him to come back to Cryptic as CEO. \"I've been on cloud nine ever since, and it was just meant to be, I think,\" Emmert said about his homecoming. Cryptic, which Emmert co-founded 26 years ago and previously led as CEO from 2011 to 2016, has itself only survived the 2020s by the skin of its teeth. In 2021, Cryptic wound up in the hands of Embracer Group, the holding company notorious for aggressively acquiring dozens of game studios and then doing its best impression of a malfunctioning cartoon contraption with b…",

Digitimes claims that Samsung is planning on more than doubling the price of its NAND chips in the first quarter of this year, \"amid tightening supply and surging demand driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence applications.\" The site further says that, \"SK Hynix has implemented NAND price increases of a similar magnitude, while Sandisk has previously been reported to be planning a 100% NAND price hike in 2026.\" That means three of the biggest players in NAND chips for SSDs all plan to double their prices, or thereabouts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Digitimes also notes that Samsung recently reported very strong financial results, with revenues up by over 22% to roughly $65 billion for the final quarter of 2025.

But before we get into all of that, let us ask the most basic question: What is it like as a regular ol' gaming chair? Well, as previously mentioned, the first thing to get out of the way is that this is not really made for me; the XL or Plus edition of the DXRacer Martian Series is intended for folks up to 180 cm tall, and is designed to support a weight of up to 125 kg. But even adjusted to my preferred tilt angle and the lowest possible chair height, my feet don't touch the floor, swinging in the air like a tiny tyrant. To put it another way, this gaming chair is very much pitched towards someone who could easily reach the top shelf. D…",

See, WoW's a wizened beast with expansions in the double digits to its name, and if you keep slapping continents on the old girl, it's going to stop feeling like a World of Warcraft and more like a hodgepodge...er, of Warcraft. Anyway, we know that we're going to get a redesigned Northrend again for the next next expansion , The Last Titan, but Blizzard's also considering taking a new lick of paint to some long-standing cities, too; beloved places that haven't seen an overhaul since Cataclysm which, not to make you feel old or nothin', came out 16 whole years ago. That's per our cover feature for the upcoming issue of PC Gamer, written by PCG contributor Heather Newman. In it, Heather spoke to both manager for visual development Gabriel Gonzalez and Paul Kubit, associate game director and lead on the expansion itself. \"It was a little scary, honestly, to go back in to tackle that zone again,\" says Gonzalez regarding Silvermoon and the Ghostlands, given their nostalgia-drenched pos…",

    "body": "Word reached me this morning that hot new PvP raid shooter Highguard has an unusual bug. According to Steam user Captain_SmellyRat (excellent), the game's resolution is tied to its post processing setting, which means lowering it drops the output resolution in turn—despite reporting otherwise in the settings menu. Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%. Turn post processing to High, and the game runs at full 4K. I tried a few different resolutions to see if the effect scaled down the stack, and yep, post processing Low seems to force the game to run at 80% of its stated resol…",

These are the common Arc material used to craft shield charges, so you'll likely already have a stockpile that you can bring into a raid (that's what I did). Otherwise, you can find them on any Arc machine. So, grab two Arc Powercells and head into Blue Gate to find an Arc Deforester.

It's called the OpenSplitDeck. The new version looks as chunky, if not chunkier, than the one we saw back in June last year. Though it has been massively overhauled since then with a heap of new upgrades and quality-of-life improvements. It now supports gyro controls, much like the Steam Controller, with one gyroscope in each half of the controller. Gyro functionality is, creator TommyB says, \"a little noisy\" at the moment, but he's looking into ways to improve this and use the dual-gyroscopes to better effect in-game. Each half of the controller also features a slim screen down the inside edge. One of the larger overhauls here is a shift away from Arduino to the Nordic nRF Connect SDK.

Bloomberg reports on a new deal between Nvidia and cloud services outfit CoreWeave that forms the basis of what is effectively the launch of the Vera CPU. In what has become a typically circular form for the AI industry of late, Nvidia is investing $2 billion in Coreweave, while the latter will buy up to $6 billion in Nvidia hardware, including those Vera chips. Bloomberg says the Vera CPU will be competing with server chips from Intel and AMD, along with other cloud computing processors such as Amazon's Graviton. But not all that much is known about Nvidia's Vera CPU. Nvidia has previously said that it runs a new custom-designed Arm core called Olympus.

    "body": "It's only been *checks watch* less than a day, and already Intel's Panther Lake is seeing some promising airtime. That's not just from the likes of publications such as yours truly, but also, it seems, from games, as the Arc B390 is now featured on the official Forza Horizon 6 system requirements . That's a game that's pencilled for a summertime launch (May 19), and as of now, there are only minimum requirements listed. On the GPU front, this means an Nvidia GTX 1650, AMD RX 6500 XT, Intel Arc A380 or Arc B390. Minimum spec Operating System Windows 10 22H2 (19045) Processor Intel Core i5 8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 Memory 16 GB RAM Graphics Nvidia GTX 1650, AMD RX 6500 XT, Intel Arc A380, or Intel Arc B390 DirectX Version 12 Storage SSD required Note that the B390 is an integrated GPU. The other entries on that list are discrete graphics cards. In other words, if we needed even more confirmation that Panther Lake is capable of bringing the fight to the discrete market, here it is. Intel's new Panther Lake mobile platform has kicked up quite the beneficent storm, offering what seems like a solitary ray of sunshine through the fog of 2026's prices and broader lack of exciting launches.…",

They went on to explain that they were an avid modder, digging into the guts of games like Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire to tweak the progression curves of player stats⁠—which is about as granular a difficulty modifier as you can get. They further asked for Sawyer's thoughts on the cost/benefit analysis of letting players get so far into the weeds \"officially,\" or at least baking in the modding freedom to do so. \"If it cost nothing⁠—which it does not⁠—then I would say let players in-game set their difficulty options however they like,\" said Sawyer. \"And when it comes to exposing data tables and letting players mod that stuff, let 'em do whatever the heck they want.\" The nature of this question has changed over the course of h…",

Hey, Highguard is out. I played around six hours between launch day and a preview event in Los Angeles last week. It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map. This phase plays out like an accelerated battle royale match—rushing to find better guns and armor, but usually not immediately fighting…",

Progression is still a little stagnant for now as Hytale chips away at early access updates, though the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers is more of what I want to see, even if it feels a little underwhelming. With the fancy book, you can summon undead hordes to smack enemies about and take the pressure off yourself. Well, I say horde, but you've got a limited amount of pages to work with. At full capacity, it's more like a small skeletal squad. You can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians. They aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire only seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments.

The channel \"Elden Ring Fights\" is exactly what it says on the tin, and it recently uploaded a banger: Dark Souls' Artorias vs. the bosses of base game Elden Ring . FromSoft dusted off the venerable swordsman to serve as a boss in Elden Ring Nightreign's recent Deathly Forsaken Hollows DLC. He's effectively been \"ported\" to Elden Ring's iteration of the FromSoft game engine, allowing Elden Ring Fights to pit him against the Lands Between's finest. And boy, for a battered veteran coming out of retirement, Artorias fares better than all those tomato cans they kept setting up in front of Jake Paul. Artorias went on an absolutely brutal tear through the bosses of Elden Ring: Early terrors like Margit and Godfrey don't stand a chance, with single hits from Abyss Artie chunking their health bars. If you have a real job and don't like watching 30-minute YouTube videos, here are the highlight battles I'd recommend skipping to: 8:22 - Maliketh the Black Blade 13:31 - Dr…",

Today, the studio released details about the Headwinds update arriving this week as the Rust Belt emerges from the depths of winter. And as any farmer's almanac will tell you, the end of winter always brings two things: Asymmetrical combat engagements and an overabundance of avian activity. Truly, the cycle of the seasons is a beautiful thing. (Image credit: Embark Studios) In a news post , Embark offered some details about what to expect when the Headwinds update arrives on January 27. The most impactful addition is a new matchmaking option that'll be available for experienced raiders who've reached level 40: Solo vs Squads, offering bonus XP rewards for lone wolves who're willing to risk a fight with a full pack. Whether or not additional XP is enough of a draw to actually get anyone to choose the new matchmaking option is another question. I'm doubtful—and personally speaking, as someone who's thoroughly on the friendlier end of the aggression-based matchmaking spectrum, you'll find me anywhere else. But if the …",
