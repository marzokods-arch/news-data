Pricing on products like a 15 pan eyeshadow palette, lipstick and lip liner duos and more ranges from $95 for the full collection to $10 for a single jelly shadow. The product color scheme is grungy and gothic with vampy red hues thrown in here and there to mimic the look of blood, obviously. Product formulas are inventive with jelly-like textures and new finishes from the sole palette, namely the metallic chrome finish that packs a punch. ColourPop has also bundled a bunch of the products, giving prospective buyers the option to buy multiple products for one neat little price.

We first previewed this update late last year, and it’s now generally available. Back in October, we got an early look at a new device setup workflow in Google Home. The revamped workflow gives you more ways to connect to third-party devices, letting you search by brand name to find both apps and devices to connect to Google’s smart home platform. Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured. With this new workflow, if neither of those are an option, you can type out the name of the specific device you want to get online to initiate pairing.",

Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning.

The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button. It seems, well, annoying — and if you’ve played Wonder, you’ll know that’s a faithful adaptation of the character.",

NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI) Scientists have discovered over 6,000 planets that orbit stars other than our Sun, known as exoplanets. More than half of these planets were discovered thanks to data from NASA’s retired Kepler mission and NASA’s current TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission. However, the enormous treasure trove of data from these missions still contains many yet-to-be-discovered planets. All of the data from both missions is publicly available in NASA archives, and many teams around the world have used that data to find new planets using a number of techniques.

The AI assistant eventually performed the task after the user encouraged it, highlighting a “gaslighting” trend in modern AI. While Gemini in Google Home excels at context, it often struggles with basic commands that the original Google Assistant handled easily. Gemini is slowly but surely replacing Google Assistant throughout Google’s smart home ecosystem. While we wait for a broader rollout, most Google Home users just want the basics to work again. Unfortunately, Google still has some work to do, as Gemini for Home sometimes ends up gaslighting users about what it can and cannot do, as one Reddit user found out.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google’s “Take a Message” feature on Pixel phones is not functioning as intended. Instead of recording the caller’s message as a voicemail, it may allow them to hear you in the background. The bug appears to affect all supported Pixel phones, starting with the Pixel 4. If you have no time to go through all your voicemails, Google’s “Take a Message” feature for Pixel devices can be really useful. If you miss or decline a call, Take a Message can automatically spin into action, informing the caller that you’re unavailable and asking them to record a message. While it sounds like voicemail, the feature uses AI to transcribe the message and automatically store it in your Pixel’s call history, where you can revisit it later. While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well. While very useful in theory, it has reportedly been malfunctioning, letting callers hear you instead of recording their message. Several users have highlighted this issue with Take a Message on their Pixel phones over the last few months. These reports, spotted by 9to5Google , are not limited…",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile is increasing its monthly bill by $0.50 per line for certain users. The increase is part of T-Mobile’s Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee, which is now $4.99 a month. This is the second hike of $0.50 since last year, but you’ll be spared if your monthly plan already includes federal taxes and telco fees. If you’re a T-Mobile customer in the US , your bill just went up overnight. That’s because the carrier is adding an auxiliary charge, separate from your monthly payment plan. As of Wednesday, January 21, T-Mobile is increasing its “Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee” to $4.99 per voice line and $2.10 per mobile data line. That’s a $0.50 increase compared to before this date, when the fee per voice line was $3.99. If you have multiple lines in your plan, the total should reflect on your bill starting this month. T-Mobile updated its bill breakdown support page (via Droid-Life ) to reflect the new prices.",

Like Hydra, the platform appears to regenerate as quickly as one of it’s somains is cut back. Earlier this month, shadow library Anna’s Archive, infamous for scraping 300TB of Spotify’s most played songs , suddenly lost its main .org domain. At the time, the site’s operator downplayed the situation, saying that domain takedowns for sites like theirs happen often . They insisted it had nothing to do with their recent scraping of Spotify at a massive scale.

However, when your flagship Pixel doesn’t have a feature that another brand already offers, it’s not unrealistic to hope that Google will introduce it to its own lineup sooner rather than later. With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game. Let’s take a look at the results.",

On Android, however, I struggle to find apps with uniquely designed experiences. As long as the app technically does what it’s intended to do, it gets a passing grade for most people.

Previously leaked specs suggest the device will feature high-end cameras: a 200MP “super large” primary camera, a 200MP “mid-telephoto” camera, and a 50MP 10x periscope zoom camera The phone is expected to debut in China and globally in March, marking an unusual international push from OPPO’s ultra tier. If you want the absolute best camera on an Android phone, you’ll pretty much have to gravitate towards an Ultra flagship. We’ve seen the likes of the Xiaomi 17 Ultra raise the bar for what they can do, and we’re expecting more of the same with the vivo X300 Ultra and the OPPO Find X9 Ultra , too. At least with OPPO, a new leak suggests the company is not only going to pack a great camera into the Find X9 Ultra flagship but also equip it with an insane 300mm telephoto extender accessory.

    "body": "Credit: AYANEO TL;DR The KONKR FIT is an upcoming Windows handheld from the prolific handheld maker AYANEO. It packs a Ryzen AI 9 HX 470, 80Wh battery, and a 7-inch OLED screen into a surprisingly compact device. AYANEO showed off a prototype, but there’s no word yet on pricing or availability. Despite announcing that it would slow down to focus on shipping existing products , AYANEO showcased two new gaming handhelds this week. Both were first announced late last year, but this is the first time we got a look at the pint-sized Pocket S Mini , as well as a powerful new Windows handheld with a surprising new chipset. The KONKR FIT is the second handheld from AYANEO’s new sub-brand KONKR, after the Android-based Pocket FIT . Despite the similarities in name and overall design, the new x86 Windows handheld doesn’t pull any punches when it comes to specs.",

Back then, its Galaxy A54 5G challenged Google’s Pixel 7a as its closest rival, combining a triple-camera system and a robust 5,000mAh battery to win users away from the simplicity of Pixel UI and the reliability of Google’s image processing. By all accounts, it was a good $500 phone, offering more than enough bang for your buck. Then, it disappeared. Well, Samsung decided not to offer the Galaxy A55 5G in the States, anyway, making its sub-flagship Fan Edition the go-to option instead. And over the course of that break, the affordable Android market has changed entirely. Rivals like OnePlus and Motorola have stepped up their game, and Google’s Pixel A series is better than ever.",

New text strings have started to reveal what to expect from Transit mode, including a training period while it learns your schedule. Transit mode will be able to automatically adjust Bluetooth and audio settings. Our devices are pretty smart about figuring out what we’re up to, whether that’s our smartwatch detecting when we’re on a bike ride, or our phone recognizing when we’re driving a car. Late last year, we caught wind of another new tool Google appeared to be developing along these lines, identifying early work on a new system for figuring out when you’re riding public transit . As we wait for Google to finish up and introduce it, we’ve got some new updates on what users can expect.

You can ask about existing events and create new ones on your secondary calendars. This is great for anyone with work, school, or family calendars. You can also change your default calendar to create events on, but the settings is hidden. It’s been nearly two years since Google released the Gemini app for Android and enabled users to switch from Assistant to Gemini despite a bunch of limitations and missing features. One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears. Now, two years later, Google has finally fixed this stupid oversight and added back support for multiple calendars to Gemini, so any employee, family member, or student can access their full schedule again — with a few caveats, though.",
