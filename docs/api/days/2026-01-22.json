This becomes the Puerto Rican artist’s 19th music video as a lead, featured artist or collaborator. He also rises to No. 3 on the weekly US Top Artists YouTube chart.&nbsp; A track off his blockbuster Un Verano Sin Tí album, the dembow-heavy banger peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in Oct. 15, 2022 and spent 14 weeks atop. In the music video, filmed by his longtime director Stillz in New York City, Bad Bunny perfectly captures the song’s “YOLO” sentiment, bringing to life its lyrics about a person who likes to date around and doesn’t want to settle down.&nbsp; It starts off with a boy being rejected by the girl he likes, then shows him enjoying the single life, and hooking up with girls, all before he gets kidnapped and forced to marry. In honor of the artist’s first all-out dembow track, the video also pays homage to Dominican culture, showing scenes at a local barbershop and the bodega (corner neighborhood shop). “It’s a song that was born very spontaneously,” Bad Bunny said back in 2023 . “All of the…",

ExoMiner++, a recently updated open-source software package developed by NASA, uses artificial intelligence to help find new transiting exoplanets in data collected by NASA’s missions. NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI) Scientists have discovered over 6,000 planets that orbit stars other than our Sun, known as exoplanets. More than half of these planets were discovered thanks to data from NASA’s retired Kepler mission and NASA’s current TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission. However, the enormous treasure trove of data from these missions still contains many yet-to-be-discovered planets. All of the data from both missions is publicly available in NASA archives, and many teams around the world have used that data to find new planets using a number of techniques. In 2021, a team from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley created ExoMiner, a piece of open-source software that used artificial intelligence (AI) to validate 370 new exoplanets from Kepler data. Now, the team has created a new …",

The Artemis II test flight will send NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, and CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen on an approximately 10-day journey around the Moon and back. It is another step toward new U.S.-crewed missions to the Moon’s surface, leading to a sustained presence on the Moon that will help the agency prepare to send the first astronauts – Americans – to Mars.
