In addition to revealing more details about Beast of Reincarnation's story and gameplay, Game Freak put a date on the action RPG: it's out this summer. Beast of Reincarnation was first unveiled last June, and its unique visual identity really speaks to me. The beautiful Japanese countryside, mystical elements, and samurai protagonist (complete with wide-brimmed kasa ) remind me of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, but the postapocalyptic world is also suffused with overgrown, rusted megastructures and gangly automatons that call to mind Square Enix's beloved Nier series. And let me be clear: Nier is beloved to me . The NieR connection isn't just visual: Beast of Reincarnation is similarly set thousands of years into Earth's future, where humanity is struggling against a plague of evil magical plants, as well as a distinctly Yoko Taro-flavored race of transhumanist robots gone wrong. \"The Golems are beings created when former humans transferred their souls into mechanical b…",

Forza Horizon 6, however, seems intent on making that difficult. With a gameplay reveal during today's Xbox Developer Direct showcase , Playground Games says the next entry in its open world arcade racing series is its biggest, prettiest, and most customizable Horizon yet—and it's coming in May. Oh, there's a giant mecha in there, too. (Image credit: Xbox Game Studios) With the Horizon festival heading to Japan, Playground Games says it's deeply invested in capturing the sights, sounds, and essence of Japanese roadways—and presumably off-roadways. The studio says it's blending in-depth photogrammetry and field recordings captured from across Japan with new audiovisual tech like dynamic tire wear and improved environmental acoustics. It even says it's paid particular attention to modeling how cherry blossom petals react to passing cars. It's in Japan, see. Horizon 6 is, we're told, bigger—in a lot of ways.

But then there's a whole class of the more futuristic stuff, like the energy weapons.\" One of Pely's first designs was the power armour, which turns its wearers into hulking mini-mechs, and this would also feed into how Pely thought about the weapons. \"The assault rifle from Fallout 4 originally didn't start out as an assault rifle, it was meant to be a gun that was scaled and suitable for a guy in massive power armor,\" says Pely. \"In…",

It started in 2019, and since then it's published a slew of successes. It's rare that I don't have a Hooded Horse game in rotation these days. One of the things that makes its success so surprising—though I'm beginning to think it's one of the core reasons it's done so well—is that Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender started the company with no industry experience, aside from his passion for modding. \"I did a bunch of different things, so I bounced around a lot,\" Bender tells me. \"I don't think I was particularly reliable in terms of career orientation.\" He graduated from college early, went to law school at Stanford, spent a year as a lawyer, then went back to school (to Harvard this time) to do a master's degree in Regional Studies: East Asia.

Part of the problem, very likely, is that the Asus RTX 5080 Prime in question has a very, very similar 2.5-slot, triple-fan design as the equivalent RTX 5060 Ti Prime model. So, at a glance, they look essentially the same—heck, this Asus AMD Radeon 9070 XT Prime looks very similar, too . Hold that thought, we'll come back to it.

Pax Dei isn't a new diversity programme, it's a \"social sandbox MMO\" where you can build your own home, make your own clothes, and generally just live out a medieval life. The idea behind it is that everything is player-led. You can set up a market stall full of goods you've made yourself, from armour to flowers, and trade with other players. There's also dungeon diving, where you'll rummage up the gold you need to buy wares from community merchants, and you can join clans and form villages and even castles if you've got enough people playing with you. Despite my preference for solo experiences, the emphasized focus on community building is so far off what I usually go for that it's swung around to interesting for me, and the fact the game is free to play until Monday, January 26 means I'm tempted to dip into it this weekend and see if I gel with it.

Would it have done better if, instead of its more general backer beta that focused on player response to the game as a whole, it had adopted a Baldur's Gate 3-style early access period, where an early portion of the game was released and used to aggressively fine-tune balance in particular? Its director, Josh Sawyer, doesn't think so. \"I still think we would have had the same issues,\" said Sawyer in response to a question from a fan. \"A lot of the issues were evident because they got magnified over the course of the game—the later you get in the game, the more the balance gets out of wack, just because there are more numbers inputting into the system.\" After all, BG3's balance wasn't perfect. \"This is not a slam against BG3, but just sort of recognition: at launch, a lot of people really did not speak fondly of how the third act of …",

After spending a lot of time with this particular mouse, I can confirm this is certainly the market for these mice. But despite me thoroughly enjoying using the Pulsar X2 CrazyLight, it probably won't be the best option out there for many competitive FPS gamers. If you aren't familiar with the company's line-up of gaming mice, looking at Pulsar's product pages can be very confusing. Even just looking at the X2 series , there are a whole bunch of different models there. There are 'A' versions which are ambidextrous, 'H' versions which have a bigger 'hump' to them, and so on, plus different size variations. It's the medium-sized X2 CrazyLight that I've been spending time with, although I have also tried the CrazyLight X2H in mini sizing. Apart from being a little too small for my hand, I also found the hump in the latter too pronounced for my liking and a little distracting, so I've stuck to considering the regular one for this review.

Lucy finally got to the Vault-Tec facility where her dad's cooking up something terrible, more Coop flashbacks, and we finally got a Super Mutant cameo. What's better, he's voiced by none other than Ron Perlman. It's a pretty short scene, the Super Mutant actually rescues the Ghoul from a nasty fate after getting punched out of a window and impaled on a pole, and then drags him to an unknown location, supposedly where other Super Mutants are living. The mutant then asks the Ghoul to join his cause of going after the Enclave. After Coop refuses, he gets knocked out and dragged away from the hideout. (Image credit: Prime Video) That's all the time I needed. I had thought we'd see a Super Mutant at some point in the show, especially after FEV was properly mentioned in the last episode, but I didn't expect they'd get Perlman to voice it.

Made in nine months, mostly as an experiment to learn Godot, and an excuse to play with some actors.

Ingold was a mathematical consultant on The Imitation Game, the movie about Alan Turing inventing the first computer to break the Enigma code in World War 2, so this seems right up his alley. The reveal that TR-49 was made in just nine months is very impressive on its own. The fact that it's also the best launch Inkle has ever had makes it even more so.

Eventually, towards the tail end of 2025, the situation resolved, and you could pick up all kinds of GPUs for considerably less than their MSRPs. Now, thanks to the global memory supply crisis, graphics cards sporting 16 GB or more of VRAM are all shooting back up in price.

Today, those same graphics cards are, at best, $450, $829, and $1,268. That might not seem particularly bad, especially in light of just how expensive they were at launch, but those prices are the very best around.

Well, wouldn't ya know it, Microsoft has announced that the Xbox app is being released for Windows on Arm. Available from today, in a blog post Microsoft says the app will bring gamers, \"the experience you know and love—ready for you to download, play and enjoy.\" The blog post also called out the fact that Windows on Arm's Prism emulation layer, which allows x86 software including games to run on Arm chips, has been updated to support AVX and AVX2 insturctions. That should broaden support and reduce the number of existing PC games that won't run on Arm PCs. Microsoft claims that, \"today, more than 85% of the Game Pass catalog is compatible with these PCs, and we’re actively working with partners to expand support even further.\" It also says, \"Epic Anti-Cheat (EAC) support also enables fan favorites for games on Arm-based Windows 11 PCs, including popular titles such as Gears of War: Reloaded, Fortnite and more.\" If this is all very promising, there is a catch. Windows on Arm is not, as we understand it…",

Unflattering name aside, this is a very hearty patch whipped up less than two weeks after launch, and the team isn't slowing down yet, as Hypixel CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme says, \"Update 3 is already in the works\". But let's not get ahead of ourselves: Update 2 is currently available in pre-release testing (enable this via the launcher's settings menu), and if all goes well, it should be in everyone's hands come Friday or Saturday, suggests Collins-Laflamme. The standout feature of Update is no doubt its improved mining experience. Pickaxes have been reworked to make higher-quality picks mine faster (frankly, I was baffled that wasn't how they worked initially). Building on that, while WorldGen V2 still isn't here, Hypixel has changed how ores are spawned. Namely, major ores are better distributed between the tiered zones, and there's much more ore overall, especially in the Devastated Lands. I still think Lucky Mining is one of the best Hytale mods , but these changes go a long way in making mining and gear progression feel more rewarding. Another major…",

However, the latest Windows 11 build hopes to smooth out the experience for PC gamers. In the release notes for Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26220.7653 , the known issue on PC is described as, \"some apps [behaving] unexpectedly when using FSE, particularly those that expect to be locked to a given size or launch additional windows.\" The issue isn't completely fixed yet, with the Insider Team continuing to \"validate scenarios and as such keeping the known issue active for now.\" It's worth noting that FSE is more sophisticated than a straightforward full-screen mode, aiming to improve gaming performance by minimising many of Windows 11's background tasks.

The best Arknights: Endfield characters are strong either because they're great at a very specific role, such as how Xaihi is the meta Cryo support character, or they're super versatile, like how Ardelia and Akekuri will work in basically any team comp. Still, there are team combos for each art which are very strong when put together. Some of these are more free-to-play friendly than others, with Electric and Physical/Cryo making for great free teams, while mono-Physical squads are currently among the most costly if you want them to perform at peak.

Players have been used to comprehensive and game-warpingly powerful combat addons for over 20 years at this point, so of course it's kicking up a fuss. Game director Ion Hazzikostas, who talked to PCG contributor Heather Newman recently , has spent a lot of his time dutifully reassuring players, reiterating intentions, and trying to disarm panic. Now the conversation's shifted in another direction: Has Blizzard gone soft on addons, by walking back some of the changes and specifics? No, says Hazzikostas, that was always the plan. As a matter of fact, when Midnight went into alpha testing, the strategy was to first go scorched-earth and see how much broke. \"I was surprised, and I learned a lot about exactly how many of our add-ons are written in the first few weeks of alpha … We realized pretty quickly that a ton of these add-ons were written …",

Thus ends the two-decade reign of interface addons, with many functionalities now replaced by Blizzard's homegrown systems. As for the reason? Turns out, if you build an entire game around requiring 12 separate WeakAuras (programmable UI elements) and nameplate mods, that's not the best experience for anybody. Even as an experienced player, I spent ages futzing around to get my WeakAuras just-so. Speaking to PCG contributor Heather Newman , director Ion Hazzikostas admits that it could've been done sooner, but the longer they waited, the more painful it became to uproot everything. \"Addons had been such a ubiquitous part of the WoW ecosystem for so long that we just said, 'Okay, I guess this is how it's going to work now.' \"But we've seen this become more and more pervasive as this trickles down… to tools that pickup groups are expected to use and configure.\" Pick-up groups basically mean any group of randoms—which, yeah.

He set himself the task of achieving the lowest possible base resolution in Red Dead Redemption 2 and then applying various upscaling technologies to compare the results. Turns out they vary from absolutely awful to still-kinda-potatovision-but-better-than-you'd-probably-guess, if that's not an unforgivably excessive use hyphenation and compound adjectives. Anywho, to go lower than 720p, for starters you actually have to edit Red Dead Redemption 2's config file. 2kliksphilip first tried 120p base resolution, then 90p. At this point, text and menu controls get very hard to read even given those elements are rendered at the upscaled resolution, which is double the vertical pixel count but still very low. Next he tried 60p and the game crashes. Turns out there's a lower limit on game rendering. \"The technol…",

Taking its name from food delivery platform Demae-Can, the Demae Channel was deactivated back in 2017 and the feature was never available outside of Japan—until now. YouTuber Retro Game Attic recently documented the process of ordering from his local Domino's via the Food Channel, a homebrew resurrection of the Demae Channel that brings the Wii's food delivery functionality Stateside for the first time. Peering at a fuzzy CRT (the Wii was a standard definition console), lengthy loads on the 2006 console draw out the process of ordering—but a 14-inch hand tossed pizza with extra cheese does ultimately arrive (via Hackaday ). As Nintendo has long since shut down many of the official servers that once supported the Wii, the Food Channel is instead offered by Wii Link , which is an unofficial homebrew community project working to restore much of the console's online functi…",

Sure, we don't really know who performs best in the endgame yet, and won't until after launch, but similar to Zenless Zone Zero, the usefulness of characters is primarily dependent on which type of team they perform best in. A character can be good because they're versatile and free-to-play friendly, or because they're currently the meta DPS or support for a specific art. Since Arknights: Endfield features elemental arts and combo skills which activate upon fulfilling specific conditions, such as reactions, team comp is the be-all and end-all. Currently, the top-tier teams are cryo and heat (though the latter has far fewer characters), though neither is free-to-play friendly, since they require six-star characters to shine. On the other hand, electric and cryo/physical hybrid teams are very free-to-play friendly, since most of the characters you need are four or five-stars. I'll rate each character below based on how valuable they are in their best team comp, or based on the fact that they're very strong and versatile, slotting into most teams, such as Gilberta, Ardelia, and Akekuri.

    "body": "More quizzes! (Image credit: Larian Studios, PC Gamer) Want to keep testing your knowledge of gaming trivia? We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Last year I made a quiz all about recognizing a game logo from just a single letter —and yes, I did all 26 letters of the alphabet. While I was laboriously putting that quiz together I noticed something interesting: a lot of games use a very stylized letter A in their logo. There are several logos where the A has someone standing inside it, a few with eyes or a face, and some shaped like an element from the game itself. I guess it's just a just a pleasantly flexible letter that designers can have a little fun with. So, I put together another letter quiz, and this time it's all about the letter A. I'll show you an A from a game logo, you type in what you think the game's name is. Don't worry, there aren't 26 of them this time. Let me know how you did in the comments!",

Dubbed the \" addonpocalype \" by some players, Tuesday's pre-patch for the new Midnight expansion (which launches March 2) brought with it: Dramatic changes to what information add-ons and mods could read about events in player combat Streamlining and simplification to virtually every character class and specialization New functions within the game's core UI to make up a bit of the difference Those changes aren't over. A mini patch, 12.0.1, will arrive in the next month and will continue to improve core WoW features, senior game director Ion Hazzikostas told us in an exclusive, wide-ranging interview. And other tweaks will happen as players figure out how to evade the limitations Blizzard has placed on their favorite combat add-ons, particularly those that simplify raid combat. 'We probably should have done it sooner' Hazzikostas chatted for nearly an hour in a broad interview covering the history and role of player-developed add-ons from Warcraft's beginning in 2004 until today. \"Add-ons have been part of the game since literally day one, since beta,\" he says. \"What we sta…",

Players have somehow spent nearly 21,000 years collectively exploring Embervale, and Steam says I've contributed 300 hours towards that myself, so I'm not wagging my finger at anybody. And even though parts of it remain unfinished, Keen Games says a whopping 5 million players have started the journey through Embervale's massive map.

Those changes included an overhaul to the armor transmog system, which is generating a lot of angst from players who are finding themselves forced to pay thousands of gold for the privilege of wearing outfits they'd already paid for. While we were skeptical about the proposed transmog updates back in November, the new system does have some appeal: Previously, transmogrification applied item appearances of your choice to equipment directly. You could save and apply entire ensembles at once, but whenever you replaced one of your equipment pieces—or if you just wanted to change outfits—you'd need to reapply your desired transmog and pay the associated fee for each piece of gear.

    "body": "Director Gore Verbinski was asked recently about something a lot of movie fans have been pondering: does CGI in movies look worse now than it used to? And if so, why? Verbinski, who directed the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the American remake of The Ring, and animated Western comedy Rango, was pretty blunt in pinning the blame on Epic's Unreal Engine , which has been used more and more for visual effects in film and television in the past several years, including the Fallout TV series . \"I think the simplest answer is you've seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said in an interview with pop culture site But Why Tho? . \"I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards.\" Epic Games has now responded to Verbinski's statement. In an email sent to PC Gamer, Patrick Tubach, VFX supervisor at Epic Games, said: \"It’s inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI. It's true that there are a lot more people making computer graphics than ever before, and with that scale comes a ra…",

Sometimes I want to play a cozy game while giving my eyes a little rest from the pastel apocalypse. I also just like trying to slip in some chill games to my friend group's rotation without them noticing that I've put cauliflower into their mashed potatoes—it's good for their blood pressure! For this list of cozy games without cozy aesthetics I've banned pastel colors, chibi characters, and I've even managed to go completely pixel art free. That last part is maybe a little more hardcore than I needed to go (otherwise something like Graveyard Keeper would have been a nice fit) but I wanted to completely set aside the cozy goggles if at all possible.
