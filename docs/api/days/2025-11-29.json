Introduced to Tempest Rising \"by popular demand\" , the superweapons take the form of base structures and come equipped with a powerful standard ability, plus the potential to \"unload devastating payloads\" onto your opponent. The GDF's superweapon of choice is the drone strike station, which Slipgate summarises as \"a battle-management node that syncs directly with the GDF's satellite constellations to coordinate orbital strikes\". When constructed, it establishes a \"massive vision radius\" around itself, significantly expanding the range at which the GDF can use their intel-based abilities.

There's been no better time to try it than its 15th anniversary, as the original game is going for just $1.19 on Steam .

You can also get the bundle with all the games in the series that made it to Steam for a little over $13. Thematically it's somewhere between a high school drama, Saw, and an Agatha Christie novel, with a psychotic teddy bear turning an academy into a prison of murder and mischief. While it is a visual novel, it's more gamey than the genre name perhaps implies: you investigate murders as they happen and try to pin the deed on the right culprit in a stylish minigame, literally \"firing their words back at them\" with metaphorical truth bullets.

Intel used to make chips for Apple, well, Apple used to use Intel CPUs, but those processors were based on x86 architecture—and, I'm sorry to say, were nowhere near as impressive as Apple's own M-series chips. Apple's move to making its own chips signified an end to its partnership with Intel, but also the beginning of a new era, one where the M-series consistently obliterates its competitors in performance-per-watt. Apple doesn't seem to be changing its mind where the M-series is concerned, though. This new partnership wouldn't involve switching back to an Intel processor, but rather it'd involve Intel manufacturing Apple M-series chips in its own foundries. Kuo revealed that Apple plans to use Intel's 18AP process node for this. (Image credit: Future) Ming-Chi Kuo teased that Apple's plan is for Intel to make its lowest-end M-series processor.

To that end, Noctua has just quietly shared some good news for those who are already on an Intel platform: its coolers will still work with Intel's upcoming LGA1954 socket. The company wrote on its FAQ page that the same coolers that have worked with the LGA1700 (Intel Alder Lake and Raptor Lake), as well as LGA1851 (Intel Arrow Lake), will remain compatible once the next gen rolls around. Noctua products aren't exactly cheap, but they're powerful, which is why we deem the Noctua NH-D15 to be the best CPU air cooler . But it's one pricey beast.

This lets your scum enter a state where they are immune to all ranged attacks, gain faster sprint speed, and don't use ammo when reloadi…",

Could that—even, should that—model apply to the Steam Machine? The publishing director of Larian Studios, the outfit behind Baldur's Gate 3 among other high-profile games, clearly thinks so.

But Nordia does have a history with Remedy: It provided legal advice to the studio in its Control 2 contract negotiations with 505 Games, for instance, (a deal that has since been undone ) and also assisted in negotiating financing deals with Tencent and Annapurna . So there's some real history there. It's no secret that a Control sequel is in development: Remedy said so back in 2022. Whether Control Resonant is that sequel is an open question, however. The trademark filing covers a lot of ground, from \"computer gaming software\" to \"printed matter\" like books and magazines, television shows, movies, music, clothing, and even, for some reason, \"lanyards for holding keys.\" It's pretty broad, in other words, and the title could be a reference to something other than a new …",

Given how expensive RAM is right now, many gamers are holding off on their upgrades in the hopes that the market will improve in the next few months. It makes sense—when you're seeing RAM kits sold for twice the price that they used to be sold for, it's hard not to want to wait it out. The Black Friday sales have only highlighted this, when we look back at the offers around Prime Day in July—just over four months ago, remember—we've seen prices rising from $170 for a 64 GB DDR5 kit to at least $600. However, Santos says that if you want to get your upgrades, it's better to act fast. When faced with a question regarding memory shortages that could potentially extend into 2027 (oh, joy) and how to navigate rising prices, Santos said: \"For consumers that are interested in getting a new PC or upgrading their current system’s GPU, SSD or R…",

    "body": "Bad news for fans of Cherry keyboards. Although the company's actual keebs don't rank on our list of the best gaming keyboards , the switches are in a league of their own—or they used to be, at least. However, Cherry seems to have fallen on hard times, with a net loss of $23 million (20.4 million euros) between January and the end of September 2025. This was with a turnover of nearly $82 million (70.7 million euros), leaving the company with more debt than equity. The future of its Peripherals division is also uncertain, and that's why it's hard to predict what will even happen to these keyboards in the future. According to Heise , Cherry is considering selling either its Peripherals division, which includes all its keyboards and mice, or the Digital Health & Solutions division. Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general \"peripherals\" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.

Meanwhile, Google itself is now reportedly considering whether to make its own specialised AI chips available to buy. Together, these chips could represent the start of a new processing paradigm which could do for the AI industry what ASICs did for bitcoin mining. In both cases, we're talking about chips broadly known as TPUs or tensor processing units. They're a kind of ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit, that's designed at hardware level to do a very narrow set of AI-related tasks very well. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs, even its AI-specific GPUs as opposed to its gaming GPUs, are more general purpose in nature. The parallel here is bitcoin mining, which used to be done on graphics cards before a new generation of dedicated mining chips, also ASICs, came along and did the same job much more efficiently. Could the same transition from more general purpose GPUs to ASICs hit the AI industry? The Chinese startup is Zhonghao Xinying.

Speaking to GamesRadar via interpreter, director Choi Ji-won is honoured to receive the accolade: \"I'm so happy that I'm lost for words right now … we didn't just view it as just pure expansion, but almost as a sequel and a brand new project.\" As for the actual Lies of P sequel that's in the works, Choi Ji-Won asks fans to \"please stay tuned for it; we are working really hard, and I will not disappoint you at all.\" And you know what, I fully believe him. Overture is, in my humble opinion, one of the best DLCs released for a soulslike game period—it's imaginative and well-designed, sure, but it also marks Neowiz finally finding its legs after a game that initially struck critics ( including us, I'm sorry to say ) as a Bloodborne carbon copy.

This build, and a release build with debug features enabled as well as another drive with the DLC, were found on a pair of Xbox 360 dev kits in a second-hand store where they'd been sitting for a year. Some of the stuff that's been unearthed was already discovered in the PC version, but is present here in expanded form. For instance, it's long been known that Mr. House originally had a second securitron girlfriend named Marilyn—she's on one of the playing cards that came with the collector's edition, and there's a mod to restore her along with the single voice line left in the release version. But load up this build and you can have a whole conversation with Marilyn . There's also an early version of Mr. House, with a face that looks a lot more Steve Buscemi than the suave charac…",

A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct. For those who haven't seen Kill Bill, or maybe just forgot, one of the film's secondary fights is a showdown between The Bride and Gogo Yubari , a teenage psycho killer in the employ of O-Ren Ishii, head of the yakuza in Tokyo. Gogo dies, rather badly (spoiler, sorry), and then, well, so does everyone else. The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film. Based on the teaser, Yuki is basically Gogo, except maybe a little psychotically peppier and with a fondness for guns rather than a meteor hammer.

    "body": "The ZX Spectrum is easily one of the most iconic PCs of all time, and it's fondly remembered by British gamers as a 1980s powerhouse. Although long gone, it's far from forgotten, as can be gathered from this Lego Ideas project . Made by lem.designs, the project is a faithful replica of the ZX Sinclair, all made out of Lego bricks. It won't play any of the classics, but it'll definitely fill you with nostalgia. The project comes with a total of 2,130 Lego pieces, and a big part of that will go towards the computer itself. The sleek PC looks almost just like the real thing, including a realistic keyboard with keys you can actually press. The keyboard alone accounts for 100 printed tiles, with stuff you're unlikely to find on keyboards of today, including \"GOTO,\" \"GOSUB,\" \"LOAD,\" and \"RUN.\" In the very corner of the ZX Spectrum, you'll find rainbow stripes, just like on the real thing. (Image credit: lem.designs/LEGO Ideas ) Of course, the ZX Spectrum wouldn't have happened without the man, the myth, the legend, the late Sir Clive Sinclair himself. Sinclair designed it alongside his team, and the Lego set acknowledges that by including a fitting tribute: a minifigure of Sir Clive Sin…",

Its launch has come with an added pleasant surprise as well: The full game, including a campaign and endless horde mode, is available on Steam for only $10. The vibe is like Spongebob and Wario Ware by way of Duke Nukem: Anarchic and nautical and gleefully stupid. The way Captain Wayne perfectly nails a '90s cartoon look in active gameplay also reminds me a lot of Pizza Tower. The whole arsenal has a great feel to it: One real winner is Captain Wayne's machine gun, which has to spin up like a mini gun and shakes the entire screen as it empties your entire ammo reserve in a matter of seconds. It's hard to stand out as a videogame shotgun these days, but the one in Captain Wayne has a great sound and feedback, this excellent two-shot pow pow chk chk rhythm that really clicked with me. Instead of a rocket launcher, you get a classico ship's cannon that launches its projectiles in a languid arc before they roll around, blowing up after a set time or contact with an enemy, almost like a riff on the Demoman's gre…",

The big news was announced in a very low-key fashion: \"We are pleased to announce that Steam Achievements are now available for Rainbow Six Siege!\" Ubisoft wrote on Steam . It also confirmed that, thankfully, the Steam cheevos will be granted retroactively, so you won't have to redo everything you've already done to earn them: Any previously unlocked Ubisoft Connect achievements will be automatically unlocked on Steam the next time you log into the game. (Image credit: Ubisoft (Steam)) Ubisoft didn't say exactly why a game that came out in 2015, and that transformed itself into the free-to-play Rainbow Six Siege X earlier this year, is suddenly now getting Steam achievements. But at this point I think we can safely say that it's kind of the Ubisoft way : After trying its luck with Epic Games Store exclusivity , Ubisoft came crawling back to Steam (just like everyone else ) in 2024, and it's been slowly but surely adding achievements to long-neglected games ever since.

Dell's COO Jeffrey Clarke says during the earnings call : \"We have not completed the Windows 11 transition.\" I wish I could call that shocking, but it's really not. It took until July 2025 for Windows 11 to overtake Windows 10 as the most popular Microsoft operating system. That was nearly four years since its initial release, and was likely spurred by the fact that Windows 10 was reaching the end of support. We saw an uptick of Windows 11 users in a recent Steam Hardware Survey , showing just how many users were holding off until the last minute. (Image credit: Microsoft) Dell compared the rate at which people are upgrading now to the time when people were making the switch to Windows 10.

Arc Raiders already has heaps of fantastic cosmetics for every type of player, whether you're a bloodthirsty PvP'er running around in a fear-inducing mask or a humble Minion-like fisher who wouldn't hurt a fly. After making friends with many a raider, being betrayed almost as often, and even taking a few names myself on occasion, I thought it wise for my own pre-match planning to mull over my approach. I know they say don't judge a book by its cover, but if I've got loot and there's another raider nearby, I've not got long to make a move to decide our fates. I'm usually one to say hi and reveal my location first, and shoot only if I need to. Well, that's what I thought until I went through each outfit one by one and realised there's an awful lot of players I'd blast in a heartbeat.
