Fallout 4, Fallout: New Vegas, and even Fallout 3 and the original Fallouts have essentially doubled their daily concurrent players on Steam since Fallout Season 2 started airing on Prime Video in December. Via SteamDB , we can see that in the weeks leading up to the show's premiere in mid-December, Fallout 4 was typically averaging about 20,000 concurrent players, but as of Sunday that count had risen to over 40,000. Likewise, Fallout: New Vegas was pulling in roughly 8,000 concurrents a day, and that rose to nearly 20,000 last weekend. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Even Fallout 3, which was typically attracting a mere hundred or so concurrent players on Steam on an average day, has risen to close to 200—not exactly a towering number, but still about double what it was before Fallout Season 2 started. Fallout 76 got a bump too, up to about 30k from the usual 10-20k average, and the original Fallout saw an influx of players as …",

In a new interview with Games Beat , Embark's CEO Patrick Söderlund went into some detail on how the studio built the game's maps, and the big surprise for me was how closely they hew to certain real world inspirations. \"[Dam Battlegrounds] is the second one we made,\" says Söderlund. \"To get the first iteration done probably takes weeks before it's playable but ugly and then it takes… I think we probably spent 6 months on this map to playtest it and make it playable.\" \"The real work is actually making sure the map plays well.

The E37T PCIe Gen5 controller may not sound like the sexiest hardware update, but I promise there's plenty about it that's at least eyebrow-raising. Basically, you can think of it as a great big step up from the Phison E31T, which features in our current budget favourite for the best PCIe 5.0 SSD for gaming , the Crucial P510 NVMe SSD . To make that short story a little longer, I'll borrow some of Phison's own words; the company touts the new E37T memory controller's ability \"to deliver competitive price-to-performance value for modern consumer workloads across notebooks and mobile devices.\" To cut through the marketing-speak, this memory controller should make PCIe 5.0 drives not only faster but just a little more affordable, too. Let's get into the numbers: according to Phison, \"E37T achieves up to 14.7 GB/s sequential reads and 13.0 GB/s sequential writes, with up to 2,000K 4 KB random IOPS.\" Bein…",

As a result, the rollout of the glasses to the UK, France, Italy, and Canada will no longer happen in early 2026 as scheduled. Meta reports \"unprecedented demand\", plus the aforementioned limited inventory, is responsible, and the focus from here is simply to fulfil current orders in the US, before re-evaluating international stock.

The Dark Rock 6 comes with six heat pipes and a single 135 mm Silent Wings fan. Meanwhile, the Pro is on a whole other level with none fewer than seven heat pipes. How about that? It also has two Silent Wings fans of unspecified size—though I'd guess from the images provided that they're also 135 mm. Both coolers offer a sleek all-black appearance, with a shroud covering the top and sides of the heatsink. That's the sorta attention to detail we've seen on other Be Quiet! air coolers in the past, although generally they have been dearer than competitors ( Arctic Freezer 36 or Thermalright Peerless Assassin) for the extra flair.

The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is where tech vendors like to go ape with new products, as well as showcase their regular updates and fresh models. When it comes to graphics cards, though, they tend to be all very much of the same design and look. Which is possibly why Gigabyte's designers have just a tad…unusual… with their new RTX 5090 graphics card. Specifically, it's the Aorus GeForce RTX 5090 Infinity . As GPU names go, that's actually very understated, which is the polar opposite of the card's appearance. Gigabyte isn't offering a full suite of images for the card just yet, but I don't think it's going to look any better from a different angle. And even if it did, you're never really going to see those angles once it's installed inside your gaming PC.

    "body": "Good news for James Bond fans hanging tough with creaking gaming rigs: The system requirements for 007 First Light are out, and it looks like it'll run on a pretty middling PC, as long as you don't mind making some compromises on the ol' eye candy. But that is the way of PC gaming, isn't it? Always has been, always will be: I used to run Quake 2 at the most hideously low-spec settings possible, so I could squeeze a few more frames-per-second out of it and thus an edge over my online competitors. And I liked it! You won't be dueling with your fellow gamers in 007 First Light, no, but you may have to strike some sort of balance between pretty and performance. Luckily, it looks like there's a good bit of wiggle room in that regard. Here's what you'll need: Minimum (1080p/30fps) Processor : Intel Core i5 9500K / AMD Ryzen 5 3500 Graphics Card : Nvidia GTX 1660 / AMD RX 5700 / Intel discrete GPU equivalent RAM : 16 GB Video RAM : 8 GB Storage : 80 GB minimum OS : Windows 10/11, 64-bit Recommended (1080p/60 fps) Processor : Intel Core i5 13500 / AMD Ryzen 5 7600 Graphics Card : Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti / AMD RX 6700 XT / Intel discrete GPU equivalent RAM : 32 GB Video RAM : 12 GB Storage : 80…",

Well, chalk up another win for the Dootster. As noted by GamesRadar , the good doctor has completed his no-hit run of Dark Souls the first, attaining hitless victory over Gwyn, Lord of Cinder with a song in his heart and also in his saxophone. Combine that with his previous no-hit wins in Dark Souls 2 and 3 (and Elden Ring, by the by) and you've got the full combo: a hitless, sax-based run of the entire Souls trilogy, a feat presumably unparalleled through all human history. To be fair, Gwyn went down like a chump. Dr Doot was using a sorcery build that made total mincemeat of the old guy. Rather than a nailbiter finish, it was more of a one-punch (one-doot) man situation. Still, our hero was rightly pleased with his achievement. \"The World's First Sax-Controlled Dark Souls No-Hit Run has been DOOTED!\" wrote Dr Doot in a post on X. \"I just beat Dark Souls without getting hit by a single ene…",

Announced at CES 2026 (via Wccftech ), Schenker has shown off the first semi-modular laptop based on Intel's Panther Lake. Last year, Intel unveiled a reference semi-modular design in its blog, and this Schenker design is the first to roll out a finished product with it. The Schenker Element 16, which is reportedly launching in Spring 2026, has an Intel Core Ultra Series 3, with support for up to 64 GB of memory. We don't yet know what the price point is or when orders will open up. As displayed on the Bestware website , there's a small latch on the bottom of the laptop, which can be flicked to get access to the internals. From there, you can take off and replace the keyboard, swap out the storage and memory, replace the battery and fans, and you can even customise the ports on the sides of the device. Wccftech says that future motherboard upgrades are planned, meaning you can swap the Series 3 chip out for something else, if available. The fact that this is based on an Intel design, however, does suggest you will only be upgrading to future Intel chips. Imag…",

    "body": "It's all a bit doom and gloom in the PC gaming market lately, what with memory shortages and incessant talk about AI above all else. So why not put our idealist hats on for a bit and see that glass as half-full? I'll help us get started: There seem to be the slight rumblings of a focus on local rather than cloud AI by the big hardware companies, which could spell good news for the PC gaming industry and, dare I say it, the memory market. Primarily, these rumblings have come from AMD's CES 2026 keynote , but there's also a glimmer of hope granted by Nvidia, too. On the former front, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su actually spent a fair amount of time talking about local AI. Admittedly, much of this was in the form of bigging up the company's new mobile chips, the Ryzen AI 400-series , which is essentially the Strix Point 300-series with some clock speed bumps. But that's to be expected, and hardly goes against my point: these companies still want people to be using devices—preferably ones with their silicon—and if AI is all the rage, local AI on devices is a big selling point.

It doesn't help that you're stuck on an alien planet, surrounded by weird, unappetising plants that you probably shouldn't consume without thorough research. But when the hunger kicks in, you'll need to scrounge up some food somehow. In StarRupture, you satiate your hunger by gaining calories. In other words, eating food. But each food item gives you varying amounts of calories, and some can even come with Toxicity. Below, I'll go over what you should look for to combat your hungry tummy. How to get food in StarRupture (Image credit: Creepy Jar) The best way to get food and gain calories early on in StarRupture is to harvest and consume Polifruit, an orange shrub often found in plentiful patches on grassy plains , including around the pond near the starting lander, where they'll respawn regularly. So yes, it's your usual survival game routine of munching on berries for the first few hours.

Looking somewhat like a K70 Core that's been hacked open to remove the numpad, the Galleon 100 SD just looks like any other in-your-face gaming keyboard, replete with RGB lighting and whizz-bang features galore. Naturally, it has an 8000 Hz polling rate and FlashTap SOCD functionality, because every other top-end gaming keyboard does. However, the Galleon eschews the trend of Hall effect or TMR switches and instead uses Corsair's MLX Pulse Linear mechanical clickers. These come pre-lubricated, and they're hot-swappable, so theoretically you could install something even faster (assuming Corsair isn't using any kind of proprietary wiring). But none of this is really what the Galleon 100 SD is all about. The unique selling point here is the integrated Stream Deck.

Where things get confusing is that these two monitors in fact use completely different OLED panels. To cut a long story short, Asus has a new 34-inch ultrawide that sports Samsung's latest QD-OLED panel technology. Meanwhile, Asus is also announcing a 27-inch 4K model, this time with LG's newest panel tech. And what both panels share is RGB stripe subpixels. Previously, Samsung's QD-OLED panels have used RGB—or red, green and blue—subpixels, but arranged in an unusual triangular pattern instead of the vertical \"stripes\" seen in pretty much all LCD monitors. LG's OLED tech has actually used vertical stripe subpixels, but with an additional white subpixel, hence the \"WOLED\" branding. In both cases, not using a standard RGB stripe subpixel arrangement can cause problems whenever subpixel addressing is used for rendering, most obviously with text and fonts. Anywho, with all that squared away, let's get to those new monitor models. The Asus ROG Swift PG34WCDN is the 34-inch ultrawide model with the Samsung QD-OLED panel. Indeed,…",

One of Phil's problems with the first version was that it all added up to quite a lot of money after adding the various parts to the DIY kit, and you didn't have the option to get Hall effect switches for that price tag. The just-announced MAKR Pro 75, though, has Hall effect switches, and they're included in its price tag… which is still steep at $250/£220, so it's not exactly a clear value improvement overall from first glance. For those who want Hall effect switches in a dinky 75% form factor that thocks as good as many other enthusiast keyboards, it should be a good shout, though. Phil said the non-Pro has a \"tank-like chassis construction\", and it looks like that'll be the same with the new one, too.

    "body": "Do you remember the Razer Iskur V2 ? That pretty good follow-up to the V1, which was a bit more expensive and came with some extra nifty features? Well, Razer is following that follow-up with a chair it calls the Iskur V2 Newgen, and Razer tells me, \"We didn't just build a breathable chair, we built a breathable performance engine.\" Yeah, that all sounds very Razer so far. But, cutting through the bravado, the Newgen is reportedly more breathable than the V2, using Razer's own Gen 2 EPU leather with \"cooltouch\" technology. It comes with a dual-density cold-cure foam seat, which Razer says goes \"without that trapped heat feeling.\" The Newgen comes with Razer's own 'Hyperflex lumbar support'. No, that's not the same as the Razer Hyperflux , which is its wireless charging mousepad. This chair instead comes with a 360-degree swivel, so you can spin all the way around, plus a memory foam head cushion, plus a 152-degree recline—which is the same as the V2. Razer says the reason the recline stayed the same is \"because it's perfect\". Ultimately, from the look and many of the specs, calling this chair the V2 Newgen makes a lot of sense. It's not an overhaul (and probably wouldn't deserve t…",

    "body": "Ah, CES. Half AI, a quarter prototypes that seem finetuned for a headline, and a quarter genuinely useful tech. With Project Motoko, Razer seems intent on hitting at least three quarters of that market. Announced today, Project Motoko is a gaming headset with a Snapdragon chip that reportedly has AI computer vision and universal AI platform compatibility. With dual 3K 60 fps cameras, Razer says it could theoretically look at what's in front of you and use an AI model to take in data. It could then give gaming advice, tell you what's in front of you, or anything else you would traditionally use a chatbot for. The first-person view means you can also stream or record video, much like the Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses . Razer tells us it comes with optical image stabilization, which should help with the whole 'two cameras strapped to the side of your head' thing. However, there's a less traditional use case here that is oh so Razer. In the pre-presentation briefing I attended, I was informed that Project Motoko can be used to give advice for the game you are playing. How it manages to accurately identify the game, then use that data to give you context-specific advice, is anyone's guess,…",

    "body": "Last year, Corsair released the Sabre V2 Pro , and it quickly took its place as my favourite mouse since the launch of the original Logitech G Pro X Superlight . That's because I'm a fan of lightweight mice for competitive FPS gaming, and the Sabre V2 Pro shoves that whole segment forward at an incredibly light 36 g. Now, Corsair has announced new versions of the Sabre V2 Pro, but these are going to be a whole 20 g heavier, making me wonder where, exactly, they'll land in terms of their target markets. The newly announced Sabre V2 Pro CF and Sabre V2 Pro MG are slightly bigger versions with \"longer battery life and tri-mode connectivity\", the former having a carbon fiber body and the latter a magnesium alloy body. Perhaps surprisingly, the MG version is the cheaper of the two, going for $150 / £120, while the CF version is priced at $200 / £160. That price difference probably has something to do with all the holes in its shell—less material, less money. It's also one of the things that disappoints me a little about it, in combination with the weight and the price. What's so great about the original Sabre V2 Pro is that it offers a genuinely unmatched light weight without being pok…",

CyberPowerPC has helped kick off this year's show with a bang, flaunting a majestic mid-tower case that could fit into either an office space or a gamer den with ease. The case in question is the MA-01, which CyberPowerPC fairly calls \"elegant\". It's a clean fishtank-style case, with a tempered glass panel stretching from the side to the front. On top sits a woven steel mesh ventilation, and on the bottom sits a selection of ports, plus the case's standout features: knobs. These knobs control LEDs hidden in the interior of the case. The top knob adjusts colour, while the second adjusts brightness, and the third adjusts mode. Presumably, this means you could have colours pulse, alternate rhythmically, or become static. CyberPowerPC says these knobs work without any software and give you access to the \"full 16.7 million colour spectrum.\" Those knobs would mean little if the case didn't also look good, but luckily, it's sleek with plenty of personality, too, thanks to that dramatic lighting. It's the type of PC you'd want to pop on a desk, not only because it looks gorgeous, but also be…",

You'd think the headline act would be the GPU update, but only the G14 now boasts \"up to\" an RTX 5080 (you could already get the 2025 version of the G16 with an RTX 5090). This hardware refresh also introduces a fresh suite of CPUs, with the G14 offering the choice between \"a next-Gen AMD Ryzen AI processor\" or a \"next-Gen Intel Core Ultra processor,\" while those opting for the beefier G16 will get their hands on a Panther Lake Intel chip . Turns out, that 'next-gen' AMD CPU option is one of the not actually all that new Ryzen AI 400 chips, specifically the AMD Ryzen AI 9 465.

Notably, Dell isn't offering discrete graphics options with the new laptops, the implication being that the iGPU in the new Panther Lake CPU makes that unnecessary. Putting aside the fact that killing off the XPS brand never seemed like a good idea, Dell's new laptops certainly look like a promising return for the XPS line. Initially, Dell is launching the XPS 14 and XPS 16, with a 13-inch model to follow. Key attributes for the XPS 14 and 16 models include extremely high quality build quality, the \"best battery life in the industry\" and optional tandem OLED displays. Chassis-wise, the laptops have an all-new design that has some similarities with previous XPS laptops, but does away with the capacitive function keys that proved so controversial, returning that top row of buttons to the keyboard proper. Dell has also added subtle etching on the otherwise seamless glass trackpad panel below the keyboard, again addressing a design issue with the previous XPS design, which left users guessing exactly w…",

It's no surprise then that Asus' most recent collaboration with the creator looks pretty snazzy. Announced at CES 2026, Asus' collab with Kojima Productions includes custom colourways for the ROG Delta II gaming headset, Keris II gaming mouse, Scabbard II mouse mat, a custom carry case, and finally the ROG Flow Z13 . This collaboration is a very white and gold affair, with iconography largely left to Kojima Productions' iconic Ludens character. Designed by long-term Kojima collaborator and Kojima Productions lead artist Yoji Shinkawa, Ludens is somewhat of a high-tech knight figure and effectively the mascot for the company. Shinkawa says, \"I wanted to create a gadget that belongs to Ludens\", and he says the tech \"has its essence.\" The only real letdown for me here is the presence of the ROG Flow Z13.

Well, you get something like the new Asus ROG G1000 : a hulking monster of a rig with three holographic fans. Asus calls the setup AniMe Holo, claiming that it's the \"world’s first holographic fan system in a prebuilt gaming PC\". The G1000 boasts one 380 mm fan with 720 LEDs and two 215 mm fans with 404 lights. These don't blast air around the PC; instead, they spin up to a point where you visually can't see the blades in motion and via a button on the top panel (or through Asus' Armoury Crate software), signals are sent to the lights to create patterns, animations, and so on before your eyes. I'm doing a poor job of describing it, so watch Asus' video above to get the full picture (if you pardon the pun).

The entire laptop is hinged: able to rotate up to 320° with a kickstand on the rear to sit it upright. In the promo materials, Asus shows how one might use the second screen in a number of different ways. Including laying it flat for a large tablet surface, setting it upright in 'Book Mode', or flipping it into an A-frame via 'Tent Mode' and playing local co-op games with a friend on both sides of the device. Hey, that's… actually pretty neat. There is a keyboard and trackpad. These are included on a separate, detachable slab that can be attached magnetically over the second screen. It can also be used separately via Bluetooth. The keyboard offers the same 1.7 mm key travel as normal Zephyrus laptops.

Ah, it's nice to have a win over the endless AI guff, isn't it? Anyway, headline news is that Intel is claiming up to a 77% integrated graphics performance boost over the previous Lunar Lake-based Intel Core Ultra 9 288V with the top end chips. That's a pretty bold statement, given how impressed we were with Lunar Lake's gaming performance overall. (Image credit: Future) Intel has also promised much improvement in its GPU driver stack, which, if true, could make these mobile beasties a force to be reckoned with for slim and light gaming machines. Key to the claimed performance figures are the architectural changes under the silicon hood.
