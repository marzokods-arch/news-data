Case in point is my reaction upon hearing about the \"most powerful gaming laptop on the planet\"— 'ooh!' —followed by the immediate dual recognition that this will be very expensive and probably very loud and scarcely worth unplugging from the mains— 'oh, yeah' . It is undeniably impressive, however, that MSI is packing very powerful hardware in such a small form factor. The company says about the Raider 16 Max HX and Raider 16 HX: \"Don’t let its size fool you. The Raider 16 Max HX is the world’s first gaming laptop capable of delivering a massive 300W total system power. Under full-load conditions, it unleashes 175W to the RTX 5090 or 5080, while simultaneously feeding 125W to the Intel Core Ultra 200HX processor—making it the most powerful gaming laptop on the planet.\" What's also impressive, and a welcome seeming trend for CES this year, is an element of modularity to these Raider laptops.

XCOM 2 (Image credit: 2K) Robin Valentine, Senior Editor: I always head into the holiday break with grand plans of catching up on all the games I missed that year… but instead I usually end up replaying something from 10 years ago. When the nights are long and the wind is cold, there's just something so rejuvenating about bedding in with an old favourite. So it was again in 2025, as I found myself on a whim starting up yet another new XCOM 2 Ironman campaign—with the War of the Chosen expansion and all the DLCs, naturally. It's not the sort of game you'd normally call 'cosy', but at this point all its bruta…",

Announced at CES 2026 (via Wccftech ), Schenker has shown off the first semi-modular laptop based on Intel's Panther Lake. Last year, Intel unveiled a reference semi-modular design in its blog, and this Schenker design is the first to roll out a finished product with it. The Schenker Element 16, which is reportedly launching in Spring 2026, has an Intel Core Ultra Series 3, with support for up to 64 GB of memory. We don't yet know what the price point is or when orders will open up. As displayed on the Bestware website , there's a small latch on the bottom of the laptop, which can be flicked to get access to the internals. From there, you can take off and replace the keyboard, swap out the storage and memory, replace the battery and fans, and you can even customise the ports on the sides of the device. Wccftech says that future motherboard upgrades are planned, meaning you can swap the Series 3 chip out for something else, if available. The fact that this is based on an Intel design, however, does suggest you will only be upgrading to future Intel chips. Imag…",

I'll help us get started: There seem to be the slight rumblings of a focus on local rather than cloud AI by the big hardware companies, which could spell good news for the PC gaming industry and, dare I say it, the memory market. Primarily, these rumblings have come from AMD's CES 2026 keynote , but there's also a glimmer of hope granted by Nvidia, too. On the former front, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su actually spent a fair amount of time talking about local AI. Admittedly, much of this was in the form of bigging up the company's new mobile chips, the Ryzen AI 400-series , which is essentially the Strix Point 300-series with some clock speed bumps. But that's to be expected, and hardly goes against my point: these companies still want people to be using devices—preferably ones with their silicon—and if AI is all the rage, local AI on devices is a big selling point. That was, of course, the idea with the \"AI PC\", a term Microsoft and co. has repeatedly jammed down our throat ever si…",

But when the hunger kicks in, you'll need to scrounge up some food somehow. In StarRupture, you satiate your hunger by gaining calories. In other words, eating food. But each food item gives you varying amounts of calories, and some can even come with Toxicity. Below, I'll go over what you should look for to combat your hungry tummy. How to get food in StarRupture (Image credit: Creepy Jar) The best way to get food and gain calories early on in StarRupture is to harvest and consume Polifruit, an orange shrub often found in plentiful patches on grassy plains , including around the pond near the starting lander, where they'll respawn regularly.

How to get water in StarRupture (Image credit: Creepy Jar) The best way to get water and stay hydrated early on in StarRupture is to harvest and consume Hydrobulbs near bodies of water.

    "body": "Asus has wheeled out some sweet new OLED panels at the CES. The most interesting is a pair of gaming monitors with so-called \"RGB stripe\" subpixel technology . Where things get confusing is that these two monitors in fact use completely different OLED panels. To cut a long story short, Asus has a new 34-inch ultrawide that sports Samsung's latest QD-OLED panel technology. Meanwhile, Asus is also announcing a 27-inch 4K model, this time with LG's newest panel tech. And what both panels share is RGB stripe subpixels. Previously, Samsung's QD-OLED panels have used RGB—or red, green and blue—subpixels, but arranged in an unusual triangular pattern instead of the vertical \"stripes\" seen in pretty much all LCD monitors. LG's OLED tech has actually used vertical stripe subpixels, but with an additional white subpixel, hence the \"WOLED\" branding. In both cases, not using a standard RGB stripe subpixel arrangement can cause problems whenever subpixel addressing is used for rendering, most obviously with text and fonts. Anywho, with all that squared away, let's get to those new monitor models. The Asus ROG Swift PG34WCDN is the 34-inch ultrawide model with the Samsung QD-OLED panel. Indeed,…",

In the months since, despite its parent company Take-Two Interactive's insistence that the studio terminated those employees \"for gross misconduct, and for no other reason,\" Rockstar has offered little justification to indicate the firings were anything other than retaliation for attempted workplace organizing. According to a statement given by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) in response to the firings, the terminated employees were all either union members or pursuing worker organization at the studio. (Image credit: Pavlo Gonchar via Getty Images) \"Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry,\" IWGB president Alex Marshall said in the union's October statement. \"This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.\" Following the initial reporting, Rockstar elaborated on its claims a…",

Well, Razer is following that follow-up with a chair it calls the Iskur V2 Newgen, and Razer tells me, \"We didn't just build a breathable chair, we built a breathable performance engine.\" Yeah, that all sounds very Razer so far. But, cutting through the bravado, the Newgen is reportedly more breathable than the V2, using Razer's own Gen 2 EPU leather with \"cooltouch\" technology. It comes with a dual-density cold-cure foam seat, which Razer says goes \"without that trapped heat feeling.\" The Newgen comes with Razer's own 'Hyperflex lumbar support'. No, that's not the same as the Razer Hyperflux , which is its wireless charging mousepad. This chair instead comes with a 360-degree swivel, so you can spin all the way around, plus a memory foam head cushion, plus a 152-degree recline—which is the same as the V2. Razer says the reason the recline stayed the same is \"because it's perfect\". Ultimately, from the look and many of the specs, calling this chair the V2 Newgen makes a lot of sense.

With dual 3K 60 fps cameras, Razer says it could theoretically look at what's in front of you and use an AI model to take in data. It could then give gaming advice, tell you what's in front of you, or anything else you would traditionally use a chatbot for. The first-person view means you can also stream or record video, much like the Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses . Razer tells us it comes with optical image stabilization, which should help with the whole 'two cameras strapped to the side of your head' thing. However, there's a less traditional use case here that is oh so Razer. In the pre-presentation briefing I attended, I was informed that Project Motoko can be used to give advice for the game you are playing.

That's because I'm a fan of lightweight mice for competitive FPS gaming, and the Sabre V2 Pro shoves that whole segment forward at an incredibly light 36 g. Now, Corsair has announced new versions of the Sabre V2 Pro, but these are going to be a whole 20 g heavier, making me wonder where, exactly, they'll land in terms of their target markets. The newly announced Sabre V2 Pro CF and Sabre V2 Pro MG are slightly bigger versions with \"longer battery life and tri-mode connectivity\", the former having a carbon fiber body and the latter a magnesium alloy body. Perhaps surprisingly, the MG version is the cheaper of the two, going for $150 / £120, while the CF version is priced at $200 / £160. That price difference probably has something to do with all the holes in its shell—less material, less money. It's also one of the things that disappoints me a little about it, in combination with the weight and the price. What's so great about the original Sabre V2 Pro is that it offers a genuinely unmatched light weight without being pok…",

Now there's a new version, and this one might go at least some way towards boosting that up. That's primarily because this is a Hall effect keyboard. One of Phil's problems with the first version was that it all added up to quite a lot of money after adding the various parts to the DIY kit, and you didn't have the option to get Hall effect switches for that price tag. The just-announced MAKR Pro 75, though, has Hall effect switches, and they're included in its price tag… which is still steep at $250/£220, so it's not exactly a clear value improvement overall from first glance. For those who want Hall effect switches in a dinky 75% form factor that thocks as good as many other enthusiast keyboards, it should be a good shout, though. Phil said the non-Pro has a \"tank-like chassis construction\", and it looks like that'll be the same with the new one, too. Apart from the chassis, we're talking an FR4 plate, gasket mounting, and 8-layer sound dampening, which will all help that so…",

CyberPowerPC has helped kick off this year's show with a bang, flaunting a majestic mid-tower case that could fit into either an office space or a gamer den with ease. The case in question is the MA-01, which CyberPowerPC fairly calls \"elegant\". It's a clean fishtank-style case, with a tempered glass panel stretching from the side to the front. On top sits a woven steel mesh ventilation, and on the bottom sits a selection of ports, plus the case's standout features: knobs. These knobs control LEDs hidden in the interior of the case. The top knob adjusts colour, while the second adjusts brightness, and the third adjusts mode. Presumably, this means you could have colours pulse, alternate rhythmically, or become static. CyberPowerPC says these knobs work without any software and give you access to the \"full 16.7 million colour spectrum.\" Those knobs would mean little if the case didn't also look good, but luckily, it's sleek with plenty of personality, too, thanks to that dramatic lighting. It's the type of PC you'd want to pop on a desk, not only because it looks gorgeous, but also be…",

Whether I get extraction camped or betrayed by some randomer who lied about being friendly, death is never too far away in Arc Raiders, especially when people have Trigger Nades.

I had innocently wandered up to the extract to call it, only to be met with a flash of light and sudden death as some rat had placed a couple of Trigger Nades on the call button and scuttled away into the bushes to wait for their victim.

Putting aside the fact that killing off the XPS brand never seemed like a good idea, Dell's new laptops certainly look like a promising return for the XPS line. Initially, Dell is launching the XPS 14 and XPS 16, with a 13-inch model to follow. Key attributes for the XPS 14 and 16 models include extremely high quality build quality, the \"best battery life in the industry\" and optional tandem OLED displays. Chassis-wise, the laptops have an all-new design that has some similarities with previous XPS laptops, but does away with the capacitive function keys that proved so controversial, returning that top row of buttons to the keyboard proper.

Well, you get something like the new Asus ROG G1000 : a hulking monster of a rig with three holographic fans. Asus calls the setup AniMe Holo, claiming that it's the \"world’s first holographic fan system in a prebuilt gaming PC\". The G1000 boasts one 380 mm fan with 720 LEDs and two 215 mm fans with 404 lights. These don't blast air around the PC; instead, they spin up to a point where you visually can't see the blades in motion and via a button on the top panel (or through Asus' Armoury Crate software), signals are sent to the lights to create patterns, animations, and so on before your eyes. I'm doing a poor job of describing it, so watch Asus' video above to get the full picture (if you pardon the pun).

    "body": "Have you ever looked at your laptop and thought you needed more screen space… vertically? I certainly haven't. Nevertheless, this new ROG gaming laptop offers just that. And there is at least one interesting way to use it for gaming. The Zephyrus Duo . Fit with two 16-inch, 3K, 120 Hz, OLED screens, and one of which sits right where a keyboard usually would. The entire laptop is hinged: able to rotate up to 320° with a kickstand on the rear to sit it upright. In the promo materials, Asus shows how one might use the second screen in a number of different ways. Including laying it flat for a large tablet surface, setting it upright in 'Book Mode', or flipping it into an A-frame via 'Tent Mode' and playing local co-op games with a friend on both sides of the device. Hey, that's… actually pretty neat. There is a keyboard and trackpad. These are included on a separate, detachable slab that can be attached magnetically over the second screen. It can also be used separately via Bluetooth. The keyboard offers the same 1.7 mm key travel as normal Zephyrus laptops. So, for all intents and purposes, you'd not lose out on a more traditional laptop experience with the keyboard overlaid the sec…",

That's not really what's happening, of course.

This is lightyears ahead of where we were just a few years ago.\" (Image credit: Future) Undoubtedly true, although at the end of 2024 (more than a year, I grant you), the Intel Arc B580 desktop GPU still gave my hardware overlord a whole heap of trouble when he came to test it, much of which was down to dri…",

Before the expected AI NPU TOPS figures, Intel's VP of PC products, Dan Rogers, dedicated a fair chunk of the company's CES 2026 presentation to the gaming chops of the 18A-based silicon. Ah, it's nice to have a win over the endless AI guff, isn't it? Anyway, headline news is that Intel is claiming up to a 77% integrated graphics performance boost over the previous Lunar Lake-based Intel Core Ultra 9 288V with the top end chips. That's a pretty bold statement, given how impressed we were with Lunar Lake's gaming performance overall. (Image credit: Future) Intel has also promised much improvement in its GPU driver stack, which, if true, could make these mobile beasties a force to be reckoned with for slim and light gaming machines. Key to the claimed performance figures are the architectural changes under the silicon hood. Next to some newly-redesigned P and E-cores lies what Intel calls a \"massive GPU\" for the high end Core Ultra X7 and X9 chips, complete with built-in ray tracing support. The iGPU in qu…",

However, the Ryzen AI Max series of APUs has picked up two extra processors, and one of them could well be the best chip to fit into any top-tier handheld gaming PC. As a quick refresher, Ryzen AI Max processors (aka Strix Halo ) comprise one or two core chiplets (CCDs) plus a huge input/output chiplet (IOD) that houses a pretty beefy GPU. It has 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units (2560 shaders), with 64 MB of Level 3 cache, and a unified memory bus that's 256-bits wide. (Image credit: AMD) Up until now, the only entry in the series that sported the full 40 CUs was the very expensive Ryzen AI Max+ 395 . That all changes with the two new chips: the Max+ 392 and Max+ 388. The former has two CCDs for 12 cores, 24 threads in total, whereas the latter uses a single CCD sporting 8 cores, 16 threads. The current Ryzen AI Max 385 is also a single CCD chip, but its GPU only houses 32 CUs. With the Max+ 388, you're getting the best Strix Halo processor for gaming: 8 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores/CUs.

The listed specifications for the Ryzen 7 9850X3D are entirely unsurprising, not least because all the previous leaks and rumours on the new chip all tallied on the point of it just sporting a small increase to the boost clock. It's literally just a Ryzen 7 9800X3D , with a 7.7% overclock. (Image credit: AMD) It's not the first Zen 5 X3D processor that AMD has released that's faster than the 9800X3D, though. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D has two core chiplets (CCDs), one with 3D V-cache, and one without. When it comes to boost clocks, the latter can hit 5.7 GHz, whereas the former topped out at 5.5 GHz in the tests I carried out in my review of the 9950X3D .

Yep, blink and you'll miss it, but it now sports a dose of HyperX branding beneath its 16-inch display, along with a big \"HX\" logo on the rear lid. (Image credit: HP) The chassis design looks to be pretty much the same, but HP has made some changes underneath the hood. While the GPU options still range between the RTX 5070 Ti mobile and the top whack RTX 5090, the CPU choices are now either AMD's newly-announced Ryzen AI 400-series chips, or a \"next gen Intel processor\", according to the press release. No prizes for guessing what that might be .

HP makes the monitors, but the newly-announced HyperX Omen OLED 34 looks to be the start of some very tempting offerings, if its impressive specs sheet is anything to go by. It's a 360 Hz 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide, for a start. That puts it in the upper echelons of gaming monitor desirability right from the off, as QD-OLED panels feature in some of our favourite displays . It's got a 0.03 ms response time, as you'd expect from an OLED display, which, combined with the super-speedy refresh rate, should make it a pretty lust-worthy monitor for anyone with a fast-paced multiplayer game obsession. High up on the spec sheet is what's referred to as \"next-generation V-stripe QD-OLED panel technology\", which HP says provides much improvement to the picture quality with less text fringing. V-stripe refers to a particular type of sub-pixel layout that puts the green sub-pixel above the red and the blue, creating an inverted \"V\".

Maybe it's that January arrives to see us flush with holiday cash and looking to link up with friends instead of spending more time with relatives, but the first couple months of the year always seem to be dominated by surprisingly huge co-op hits. My incontrovertible evidence: 2025: REPO (February) : 271,571 concurrent players 2024: Palworld (January) : 2,101,867 concurrents 2023: Sons of the Forest (February) : 414,257 concurrents 2022: *crickets* 2021: Valheim (February) : 502,387 concurrents Admittedly I couldn't really find something that fits for 2022. (Lost Ark blew up huge in February 2022 to the tune of 1,325,305 concurrent players, but it's a free-to-play MMO so that feels like cheating.) Still, the trend is mostly true: early in the year there's almost always some big co-op hit that busts the doors off Steam. These games are usually pretty inexpensive, especially in comparison to the eye-watering $70 price tags of some games these days, and they're often early access, survival-ish, basebuilder-y games…",
