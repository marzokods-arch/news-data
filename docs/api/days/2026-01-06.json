Arc Raiders was planned as a free-to-play game for the majority of its lengthy development, but in late 2024, Embark pivoted to a traditional paid model . In a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi , Embark founder Patrick Söderlund reflected on the decision, and said it was easier to cut against the grain of free-to-play after witnessing the success of other premium multiplayer games like Helldivers 2. \"It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like Helldivers and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'\" Söderlund said. \"We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue.

In a new interview with Games Beat , Embark's CEO Patrick Söderlund went into some detail on how the studio built the game's maps, and the big surprise for me was how closely they hew to certain real world inspirations. \"[Dam Battlegrounds] is the second one we made,\" says Söderlund. \"To get the first iteration done probably takes weeks before it's playable but ugly and then it takes… I think we probably spent 6 months on this map to playtest it and make it playable.\" \"The real work is actually making sure the map plays well.

The E37T PCIe Gen5 controller may not sound like the sexiest hardware update, but I promise there's plenty about it that's at least eyebrow-raising. Basically, you can think of it as a great big step up from the Phison E31T, which features in our current budget favourite for the best PCIe 5.0 SSD for gaming , the Crucial P510 NVMe SSD . To make that short story a little longer, I'll borrow some of Phison's own words; the company touts the new E37T memory controller's ability \"to deliver competitive price-to-performance value for modern consumer workloads across notebooks and mobile devices.\" To cut through the marketing-speak, this memory controller should make PCIe 5.0 drives not only faster but just a little more affordable, too. Let's get into the numbers: according to Phison, \"E37T achieves up to 14.7 GB/s sequential reads and 13.0 GB/s sequential writes, with up to 2,000K 4 KB random IOPS.\" Bein…",

When it comes to graphics cards, though, they tend to be all very much of the same design and look. Which is possibly why Gigabyte's designers have just a tad…unusual… with their new RTX 5090 graphics card. Specifically, it's the Aorus GeForce RTX 5090 Infinity . As GPU names go, that's actually very understated, which is the polar opposite of the card's appearance. Gigabyte isn't offering a full suite of images for the card just yet, but I don't think it's going to look any better from a different angle. And even if it did, you're never really going to see those angles once it's installed inside your gaming PC.

It is undeniably impressive, however, that MSI is packing very powerful hardware in such a small form factor. The company says about the Raider 16 Max HX and Raider 16 HX: \"Don’t let its size fool you. The Raider 16 Max HX is the world’s first gaming laptop capable of delivering a massive 300W total system power. Under full-load conditions, it unleashes 175W to the RTX 5090 or 5080, while simultaneously feeding 125W to the Intel Core Ultra 200HX processor—making it the most powerful gaming laptop on the planet.\" What's also impressive, and a welcome seeming trend for CES this year, is an element of modularity to these Raider laptops.

When the nights are long and the wind is cold, there's just something so rejuvenating about bedding in with an old favourite. So it was again in 2025, as I found myself on a whim starting up yet another new XCOM 2 Ironman campaign—with the War of the Chosen expansion and all the DLCs, naturally.

Announced at CES 2026 (via Wccftech ), Schenker has shown off the first semi-modular laptop based on Intel's Panther Lake. Last year, Intel unveiled a reference semi-modular design in its blog, and this Schenker design is the first to roll out a finished product with it. The Schenker Element 16, which is reportedly launching in Spring 2026, has an Intel Core Ultra Series 3, with support for up to 64 GB of memory. We don't yet know what the price point is or when orders will open up. As displayed on the Bestware website , there's a small latch on the bottom of the laptop, which can be flicked to get access to the internals. From there, you can take off and replace the keyboard, swap out the storage and memory, replace the battery and fans, and you can even customise the ports on the sides of the device. Wccftech says that future motherboard upgrades are planned, meaning you can swap the Series 3 chip out for something else, if available. The fact that this is based on an Intel design, however, does suggest you will only be upgrading to future Intel chips. Imag…",

Primarily, these rumblings have come from AMD's CES 2026 keynote , but there's also a glimmer of hope granted by Nvidia, too. On the former front, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su actually spent a fair amount of time talking about local AI. Admittedly, much of this was in the form of bigging up the company's new mobile chips, the Ryzen AI 400-series , which is essentially the Strix Point 300-series with some clock speed bumps. But that's to be expected, and hardly goes against my point: these companies still want people to be using devices—preferably ones with their silicon—and if AI is all the rage, local AI on devices is a big selling point.

Those flickers of concern turned into a full-on conflagration following a recent report from Romanian outlet Need4Gamers , referencing stats from venture capital data platform thevc.kr which seem to show significant job reductions at the studio in mid-to-late 2025. In addition, Need4Gamers' reporter wrote that his own sources in and around the studio were decidedly negative about its outlook. I've reached out to Evr Studio to ask for a statement on its position and the future of Mudang: Two Hearts, and I'll update this piece if I hear back.

Naturally, it has an 8000 Hz polling rate and FlashTap SOCD functionality, because every other top-end gaming keyboard does. However, the Galleon eschews the trend of Hall effect or TMR switches and instead uses Corsair's MLX Pulse Linear mechanical clickers. These come pre-lubricated, and they're hot-swappable, so theoretically you could install something even faster (assuming Corsair isn't using any kind of proprietary wiring).

Where things get confusing is that these two monitors in fact use completely different OLED panels. To cut a long story short, Asus has a new 34-inch ultrawide that sports Samsung's latest QD-OLED panel technology. Meanwhile, Asus is also announcing a 27-inch 4K model, this time with LG's newest panel tech. And what both panels share is RGB stripe subpixels. Previously, Samsung's QD-OLED panels have used RGB—or red, green and blue—subpixels, but arranged in an unusual triangular pattern instead of the vertical \"stripes\" seen in pretty much all LCD monitors. LG's OLED tech has actually used vertical stripe subpixels, but with an additional white subpixel, hence the \"WOLED\" branding. In both cases, not using a standard RGB stripe subpixel arrangement can cause problems whenever subpixel addressing is used for rendering, most obviously with text and fonts. Anywho, with all that squared away, let's get to those new monitor models. The Asus ROG Swift PG34WCDN is the 34-inch ultrawide model with the Samsung QD-OLED panel. Indeed,…",

One of Phil's problems with the first version was that it all added up to quite a lot of money after adding the various parts to the DIY kit, and you didn't have the option to get Hall effect switches for that price tag. The just-announced MAKR Pro 75, though, has Hall effect switches, and they're included in its price tag… which is still steep at $250/£220, so it's not exactly a clear value improvement overall from first glance. For those who want Hall effect switches in a dinky 75% form factor that thocks as good as many other enthusiast keyboards, it should be a good shout, though. Phil said the non-Pro has a \"tank-like chassis construction\", and it looks like that'll be the same with the new one, too.

CyberPowerPC has helped kick off this year's show with a bang, flaunting a majestic mid-tower case that could fit into either an office space or a gamer den with ease. The case in question is the MA-01, which CyberPowerPC fairly calls \"elegant\". It's a clean fishtank-style case, with a tempered glass panel stretching from the side to the front. On top sits a woven steel mesh ventilation, and on the bottom sits a selection of ports, plus the case's standout features: knobs. These knobs control LEDs hidden in the interior of the case. The top knob adjusts colour, while the second adjusts brightness, and the third adjusts mode. Presumably, this means you could have colours pulse, alternate rhythmically, or become static. CyberPowerPC says these knobs work without any software and give you access to the \"full 16.7 million colour spectrum.\" Those knobs would mean little if the case didn't also look good, but luckily, it's sleek with plenty of personality, too, thanks to that dramatic lighting. It's the type of PC you'd want to pop on a desk, not only because it looks gorgeous, but also be…",

There are already similar kinds of things built into toys that respond to cameras in your smart devices to 'enhance' play, but I love the fact Lego has deliberately eschewed that avenue because of the attention a screened device will inevitably pull away from the physical play.

Whether I get extraction camped or betrayed by some randomer who lied about being friendly, death is never too far away in Arc Raiders, especially when people have Trigger Nades.

I had innocently wandered up to the extract to call it, only to be met with a flash of light and sudden death as some rat had placed a couple of Trigger Nades on the call button and scuttled away into the bushes to wait for their victim.

Putting aside the fact that killing off the XPS brand never seemed like a good idea, Dell's new laptops certainly look like a promising return for the XPS line.

Key attributes for the XPS 14 and 16 models include extremely high quality build quality, the \"best battery life in the industry\" and optional tandem OLED displays.

    "body": "Hideo Kojima, being a man obsessed with movies, has a bit of an eye for aesthetics. From the lush greens of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater to the smattering of golds, blues and black in Death Stranding , he has spent decades working on games that stand out from the first screenshot. It's no surprise then that Asus' most recent collaboration with the creator looks pretty snazzy. Announced at CES 2026, Asus' collab with Kojima Productions includes custom colourways for the ROG Delta II gaming headset, Keris II gaming mouse, Scabbard II mouse mat, a custom carry case, and finally the ROG Flow Z13 . This collaboration is a very white and gold affair, with iconography largely left to Kojima Productions' iconic Ludens character. Designed by long-term Kojima collaborator and Kojima Productions lead artist Yoji Shinkawa, Ludens is somewhat of a high-tech knight figure and effectively the mascot for the company. Shinkawa says, \"I wanted to create a gadget that belongs to Ludens\", and he says the tech \"has its essence.\" The only real letdown for me here is the presence of the ROG Flow Z13. We tested the laptop/tablet hybrid early last year, and its beefy Ryzen AI Max is underpowered for su…",

    "body": "If you browse through any list of prebuilt gaming PCs for sale, you'll notice that they typically all look very much alike. That's because vendors use basic items for cases and fans to cut costs wherever possible. But what happens when a PC manufacturer doesn't skimp on the goodies and goes all out to impress? Well, you get something like the new Asus ROG G1000 : a hulking monster of a rig with three holographic fans. Asus calls the setup AniMe Holo, claiming that it's the \"world’s first holographic fan system in a prebuilt gaming PC\". The G1000 boasts one 380 mm fan with 720 LEDs and two 215 mm fans with 404 lights. These don't blast air around the PC; instead, they spin up to a point where you visually can't see the blades in motion and via a button on the top panel (or through Asus' Armoury Crate software), signals are sent to the lights to create patterns, animations, and so on before your eyes. I'm doing a poor job of describing it, so watch Asus' video above to get the full picture (if you pardon the pun). Whether it looks as crisp as that in real life is anyone's guess, but the general consensus in the PC Gamer HW office is that it looks kinda neat. Of course, having such b…",

    "body": "Have you ever looked at your laptop and thought you needed more screen space… vertically? I certainly haven't. Nevertheless, this new ROG gaming laptop offers just that. And there is at least one interesting way to use it for gaming. The Zephyrus Duo . Fit with two 16-inch, 3K, 120 Hz, OLED screens, and one of which sits right where a keyboard usually would. The entire laptop is hinged: able to rotate up to 320° with a kickstand on the rear to sit it upright. In the promo materials, Asus shows how one might use the second screen in a number of different ways. Including laying it flat for a large tablet surface, setting it upright in 'Book Mode', or flipping it into an A-frame via 'Tent Mode' and playing local co-op games with a friend on both sides of the device. Hey, that's… actually pretty neat. There is a keyboard and trackpad. These are included on a separate, detachable slab that can be attached magnetically over the second screen. It can also be used separately via Bluetooth. The keyboard offers the same 1.7 mm key travel as normal Zephyrus laptops. So, for all intents and purposes, you'd not lose out on a more traditional laptop experience with the keyboard overlaid the sec…",

That's not really what's happening, of course.
