Here’s what I think we can expect to see more of in 2026. The AI Bullet Train Expect more rapid-paced shock and awe in the world of AI. We will see more “AI artists” making debuts, more market deals between content aggregators and AI companies, and more surprises that no one is expecting. As to the market deals with AI companies, I would caution knee-jerk reactions and underscore the importance of the three Cs as it relates to music creators: Clarity, Consent and Compensation. Shout out to the Music Artists Coalition for establishing the mandate, and many thanks in advance to the record labels and music publishers that adhere strictly to these guidelines.

Instead, newer and more secular hits have once again swarmed the chart&#8217;s top regions — including &#8220;Choosin&#8217; Texas,&#8221; the late-2025 breakout hit for rising singer-songwriter Ella Langley . The catchy and quintessentially country heartbreak lament had previously peaked just outside the Hot 100&#8217;s top 10, but now rebounds all the way from 48-5 — marking Langley&#8217;s highest career peak to date, and her first visit to the top 10.

Google told Android Authority that, effective 2026, Google will publish new source code to AOSP in Q2 and Q4.

Razer is pitching headphones as a new way to control AI, offering environmental awareness and support for major AI platforms, though it remains a concept with no product plans confirmed. Razer also showcased new AI-focused accessories at the event, including the Wolverine V3 BT controller designed for ultra-low-latency gaming on compatible LG TVs. Razer is no stranger to showing off cool concept ideas at trade shows like CES , including stuff like a high-tech facemask and a climate-controlled chair . This year, the company has something equally innovative to share in the form of Project Motoko. At first glance, you’d assume that these were simply a pair of Bluetooth headphones, but underneath you’ll find an incredible amount of AI-powered smarts.

Every company is indeed cramming AI into as many devices and form factors as possible, so I’d forgive you if your knee-jerk reaction is to write off Razer’s AI headphones (known as Project Motoko) as just more AI nonsense.

While it’s understandable to restrict video playback to prevent it from distracting users, there’s no reason it should restrict playback when the car is stationary or has its ignition turned off. Google, if it wanted, could place curbs on watching videos when it detects the car in motion. It already does that by preventing users from using the physical keyboard to search for a destination in Google Maps when the vehicle is in motion, and instead only allows using voice for search.",

Earlier this year, scientists used NASA’s IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarization Explorer) to study a white dwarf star and its X-ray polarization. MIT/Jose-Luis Olivares By Michael Allen For the first time, scientists have used NASA’s IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarization Explorer) to study a white dwarf star. Using IXPE’s unique X-ray polarization capability, astronomers examined a star called the intermediate polar EX Hydrae, unlocking the geometry of energetic binary systems. In 2024, IXPE spent nearly one week focused on EX Hydrae, a white dwarf star system located in the constellation Hydra, approximately 200 light-years from Earth. A paper about the results published in the Astrophysical Journal. Astrophysics research scientists based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge led the study, along with co-authors at the University of Iowa, East Tennessee State University, University of Liége, and Embry Riddle Aeronautical University.

Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series.

What I really mean is that the things we can do with modern smartphone cameras are downright remarkable. We can take telephoto-zoomed macro shots, insert ourselves into images in-camera, and even reimagine the sky if we’re stuck on a gray, cloudy day. However, one thing seems to get worse with every attempt to improve it, and I think we need to step back.",

It drops the ugly ribbon cable and forced soundbar of the original version using the Zero Connect Box to deliver an almost cable-free wall-mounted setup. With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR Narwal has launched the Flow 2 Ultra, a new robot vacuum cleaner that can not only detect and differentiate between objects in real-time, but also find your pets. It features “unlimited object recognition,” powered by a new AI foundation model (NarGPT) and dual RGB cameras. It also comes with specialized modes for households with babies. Narwal is using CES 2026 to show how far robot vacuum cleaners have come. The company has announced the Narwal Flow 2 Ultra, a successor to the Narwal Flow we reviewed last year . While the original Flow already impressed us with its precise navigation, self-cleaning base station, and more, the Flow 2 pushes innovation even further by doing something robot vacuums traditionally struggle with: understanding what they’re looking at, not just avoiding it.",

Using a self-developed OmniSense VLA model, the robot aims to adapt to various household tasks, such as folding clothes, among others. SwitchBot also revealed the Lock Vision series smart lock, the AI MindClip recorder, an E-Ink Weather Station, and the OBBOTO AI desk light. By conventional definition, smart home products excel at one task, and they do it expertly. However, there is also a need for more generalist products. SwitchBot tried to tap into this market with the multi-tasking Robot K20 Plus Pro last year — a vacuum that can do more than just vacuum. This year at CES , SwitchBot is going all in on generalist smart home products with an actual robot. Meet the onero H1, SwitchBot’s first humanoid robot.

The new SwitchBot Weather Station features a 7.5-inch E-Ink display that keeps key household and weather data visible at a glance, without the glare or distractions of a tablet-style screen. It’s meant to live on a counter or entry table, surfacing the information you want before heading out the door. As LCD smart displays continue creeping into more corners of the home, SwitchBot’s E-Ink Weather Station feels like a quieter alternative and a calmer way to keep tabs on your environment.",

The new XREAL 1S glasses improve on the older pair in a lot of little ways, all while shaving a few bucks off the previous model’s price tag. Like the XREAL One, the XREAL 1S glasses plug into anything with USB-C video output, showing that output on micro-OLED displays just behind the glasses’ lenses to create a sort of virtual display. Compared to the older model, the 1S comes with better resolution 1200p per eye (up from 1080p); a wider, 52-degree field of view; and brighter micro-OLED displays that are now 16:10 rather than 16:9.",
