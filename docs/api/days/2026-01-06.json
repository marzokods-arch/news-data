    "body": "كارل يسجل ويحتفل على طريقة رونالدو.. فهل اقترب من فريق أحلامه؟ زاد لينارت كارل، لاعب بايرن ميونخ الشاب، من الحديث الدائر حول مستقبله، بعدما احتفل على طريقة أسطورة ريال مدريد ونجم النصر السعودي حاليا كريستيانو رونالدو، خلال المباراة الودية التي جمعت الفريق البافاري مع ريد بول سالزبورج، في لقطة أعادت إلى الواجهة تصريحاته السابقة عن حلم اللعب بقميص النادي الملكي. وسجل كارل في اللقاء الودي الذي انتهى بفوز البافاري 5-0، قبل أن يحتفل بإشارة \"كالما كالما\" الشهيرة، المرتبطة برونالدو خلال فترته الذهبية مع ريال مدريد، وهو ما قد يتم تفسيره على أنه رسالة رمزية تحمل دلالات أبعد من مجرد احتفال عابر. وكان النجم الصاعد قد كشف في وقت سابق عن نادي أحلامه، في تصريحات نقلها موقع \"سكاي ألمانيا\" ، حين قال ضاحكا عند سؤاله عن وجود ناد يحلم باللعب له بعيدا عن بايرن ميونخ: \"آمل أن يظل هذا الأمر سرًا بيننا\". وأضاف: \"بايرن ميونخ ناد كبير جدا، ومن الأحلام اللعب فيه، لكن في مرحلة ما، أريد بالتأكيد الذهاب إلى ريال مدريد، هذا هو فريق أحلامي، ولكن دعوا ذلك يبقى بيننا\". ورغم تأكيده على تقديره الكبير للنادي البافاري، أقر كارل بأن ريال مدريد يمثل الحلم الأبرز في مسيرته، وهو ما لم يرق لجماهير بايرن، خاصة في ظل المستويات اللافتة التي يقدمها اللاعب هذا الموسم.",

    "body": "Intel will formally launch its first Core Ultra Series 3 laptop processors later this month, the company announced at its CES keynote today. Codenamed Panther Lake and targeted, at least for now, at high-end ultraportable PCs, the Core Ultra 3 chips will also be the first to use Intel's 18A manufacturing process, the company's effort to catch up with the chip manufacturing technology of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). The launch will start with 14 chips across five product families, which Intel says will be used in \"over 200\" PC designs. The first of these will be available on January 27, with others following \"throughout the first half of this year.\" The Core Ultra X9 and Core Ultra X7 processors include all of Intel's latest CPU and GPU architectures, plus a fully enabled 12-core Intel Arc B390 integrated GPU and support for slightly faster LPDDR5x-9600. The Core Ultra 9 and 7 processors will use all of the same technologies, but with just four GPU cores and support for either LPDDR5x-8533 or DDR5-7200 DIMMs. But they will offer 20 PCI Express lanes, up from 12 for the X9 and X7, meaning they'll pair better with dedicated GPUs. The Core Ultra 5 chips are mostly lower-end models wit…",

Things looked pretty grim for a while, but then Congress stepped in. Congress, of course, sets the federal government's budget. In many ways, Congress abdicated authority to the Trump administration last year. But not so, it turns out, with federal spending. Throughout the summer and fall, as the White House and Congress wrangled over various issues, lawmakers made it clear they intended to fund most of NASA's science portfolio.

Anthem’ s early 2019 release was met with a lot of middling-to-poor reviews (including one from Ars itself ), followed about a year later by a promise from BioWare General Manager Casey Hudson that a \"longer-term redesign\" and \"substantial reinvention\" of the overall game experience were coming. Hudson left BioWare in December 2020 , though, and a few months later, that planned Anthem overhaul was officially canceled .

Gemini can generate a slideshow of your choosing on the spot, but it can also feed those images into Veo or Nano Banana.

    "body": "Archaeologists have discovered Africa's oldest known cremation pyre at the base of Mount Hora in Malawi. According to a paper published in the journal Science Advances, radiocarbon testing dates the site to about 9,500 years ago, prompting a rethinking of group labor and ritual in such ancient hunter-gatherer communities. Many cultures have practiced some form of cremation. There is a Viking cremation site known as Kalvestene on the small island of Hjarnø in Denmark, for instance. And back in 2023, we reported on an unusual Roman burial site where cremated remains had not been transported to a separate final resting place but remained in place, covered in brick tiles and a layer of lime and surrounded by several dozen bent and twisted nails—possibly an attempt to prevent the deceased from rising from the grave to haunt the living.) But the practice was extremely rare among hunter-gatherer societies, since building a pyre is labor-intensive and requires a great deal of communal resources. There is very little evidence of cremation predating the mid-Holocene (between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago). According to the authors of this latest paper, the earliest known concentration of burnt …",

Now, several decades after the drug was first introduced, a growing number of US hospitals have stopped using the anesthetic because of its outsized environmental impact. On January 1, the European Union went a step further, prohibiting its use in all but medically necessary cases. Desflurane is more than 7,000 times more effective at warming the planet over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide on a pound-for-pound basis. However, curbing its use alone won’t solve climate change. The anesthetic contributes only a small fraction of total global warming, which is driven by far larger volumes of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Still, emissions from the drug add up. Approximately 1,000 tons of the gas are vented from hospitals and other health care facilities worldwide each year. The emissions have a near-term climate impact equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions from approximately 1.6 million automobiles. Read full article Comments",
