But right off the bat in Fallout Season 2, Episode 1, we get to see a location I remember fondly from one of the Fallout games—and surprisingly, it has absolutely nothing to do with New Vegas at all. Thinking about it, this location is probably the place I've spent the most time out of all of the Fallout games I've played. When it showed up in the episode, I immediately got a buffout-sized dose of nostalgia. As the kids say, it hit me right in the feels. (Apologies if the kids no longer say this.) In Episode 1, Lucy and the Ghoul are following Hank's bloody footprints through the desert from California to Nevada, and they discover he made a stop at a location players of Fallout 4 are sure to recognize: the Starlight Drive-In Theatre. Naturally, this can't be the same Starlight Drive-In from Fallout 4—that would be all the way across the country in t…",

I love my job—I just don't love it to the exclusion of everything else in my life, and people who put their work above all other concerns, like friends, family, and their physical and mental health, make me a bit uneasy. Case in point: Hank MacLean, played by Kyle MacLachlan in Prime Video's Fallout series. Hank is the ultimate business zealot. Before the bombs fell, Hank was so dedicated to his work at Vault-Tec that he voluntarily had himself cryogenically frozen for a couple centuries. He got thawed out, married a Vault-dweller named Rose, had two kids, and then murdered 30,000 people with an A-bomb. All in the name of business. And he was just getting started! In the final episode of Season 1, Hank saw his daughter learn what a monster he was, left her behind to mercy-kill her ghoulified mother, then stomped his way across the desert to reach New Vegas. As Season 2 begins we see that Hank has not been shattered by the consequences of his evil acts: he's actually invigorated and ready for more. Discovering that the front desk at Vault-Tec has collected over 400,000 unread messages over the past two centuries actually b…",

Following Lucy and The Ghouls' journey to find her father and his family, the duo stumbles across tons of iconic Wasteland locations like New Vegas, a fan favourite Fallout 4 spot, Dinky the T. Rex, and one of the most mysterious cut locations from Fallout: New Vegas . I'm of course talking about Vault 24. Over the course of Fallout's life, there have been many iconic Vaults mentioned and featured in games. Many were the childhood homes of our protagonists and player characters—like Lucy's own Vault 33, or Vault 13 from the OG Fallout. But the vaults run the gamut from capsules of Americana to harrowing psychological experiments. Here are just some of the more interesting examples: Vault 4 (TV Show): In season 1, we saw Lucy and Maximus explore Vault 4, the previous home of a group of scientists who experimented with mutants and Wastelanders. Vault 11 (New Vegas): A social experiment took place to see how willing people would be to sacrifice others for the safety of the majority.

The topic came up in a recent interview with IGN , and Howard was pretty clear it's a 'no' from him: \"They've offered me a whole bunch, even in Season 1,\" says Howard. \"I was going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things. I think I'm best behind the camera.” Spoiler alert for Season 1, obviously. This scene is one of the revelations that occurs towards the end of that season, and is a flashback to how Vault-Tec executives and various other business big-hitters divide the various vault experiments between themselves before they agree to drop the bombs.

By provoking controversy, Horses has clearly done part of its job as a work of art, although after playing it, I was disappointed that it didn't fully take advantage of its potential as a game. It's visually strong and thematically coherent, and a fascinating attempt to explore topics and tones in games that have often been reserved for film, but it struggles to integrate the experience of the player in a way that doesn't distract from its point. The horses are people, if you hadn't noticed yet In Horses, you play a young man, Anselmo, who's sent to stay and work for two weeks on a farm. The farm is populated mainly by naked humans wearing horse masks. Bad things happen on the farm.

It deals with sexuality frankly, unpleasantly, and often. There's also sl…",

You'll find the offer in your Arc Raiders inbox upon launching the game: \"Unlock an exclusive outfit in Arc Raiders by completing a special Raider contract in The Finals, the world's first Dynamism shooter from Embark studios!\" The message itself doesn't specify what that outfit is or what it looks like, but if you boot up The Finals and head over to the challenges screen, the reward is there. The Finals outfit is a recolor of the Ryder skin usually earned through the free raider deck. The primary colors are white and red to match The Finals. The raider contract in The Finals couldn't be simpler: Play three matches in any mode . Doing so will automatically unlock the outfit in Arc Raiders as long as you've linked the same Embark ID to both games. You'll receive a follow-up message in your Arc Raiders inbox allowing you to claim the outfit—this took about half an hour to appear in my inbox, so be patient.

Stellar Blade was Shift Up's debut release on Steam, which naturally exposed it to a much wider Western audience. Of course it was a different sort of exposure that put Stellar Blade over the top with a certain portion of gamers, but beneath all the silly T&A was a reasonably solid action game that put up more than three million copies sold across PC and PS5 as of July 2025.

At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs.

Sure, it's expensive and difficult to get used to, but if you can afford one and commit to its steep learning curve, I reckon it's one of the very best ergonomic keyboards around. So when ZSA offered to send over its Voyager keyboard, along with its new Navigator trackball module, I had high expectations. Essentially, the Voyager is a pared-down Moonlander, with all excess fat trimmed away to leave as minimal a keyboard as possible. \"Laptop-friendly,\" says ZSA's marketing. \"Goes anywhere—on your desk or on the road.\" I certainly can't argue with that because with just 52 keys and a total thickness of just 16 mm (0.62 inches), the Voyager is as whisper-thin as you could want. However, both the thickness and key count result in some notable compromises. For example, there's no wireless connectivity option because batteries would add to the weight, cost, and size of the keyboard. With such few keys, you have to make full use of the Voyager's layer system to access standard options such as function keys. On the plus side, the ZSA Voyager comes with multiple USB cables of…",

It's more pressure,\" he said. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing,\" Vincke added. Vincke has previously admitted that Larian planned to work on another D&D game following Baldur's Gate 3 ; ultimately the team wasn't excited about spending years working on a sequel and pivoted to a new project, which we now know was Divinity. There will still be similarities between BG3 and Divinity—Larian confirmed it's sticking to turn-based combat—but if you think that means developing its next intricate RPG will be easier, you'd be wrong. Larian was wrong, too. \"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this.'

We first reviewed the RTX 3060 way back in February 2021 . So, it's had an exceptionally long run of nearly five years.

Amazon should know this well, having turned a bunch of The Rings of Power's second season into a weird rehash of Star Wars with Tom Bombadil as Yoda. And though I didn't hate the second season of The Witcher, it was a shame to lose the twisty structure of the first season's jumbled timeline, which relied on viewers spotting details to untangle which events took place when, and not gain anything nearly as thinky to replace it. So I went into Fallout Season 2 with concerns. For starters, I expected the pre-war flashbacks to become vestigial, hurried past to get on with the modern day story of Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Praise be to the Atom then, that the flashbacks remain central. Barb continues making moral compromises on behalf of her family and Coop keeps finding out about corporate shenanigans that force him to become involved. But usually the reason TV shows disappoint in their second season is, while the first season can focus on introducing the core cast, the second needs to broaden things to keep generating new story.

Once the games are chosen, we assign award categories based on what quality we think that game specifically excels at. That's why there's a different selection of categories each year.

    "body": "If you were still thinking about finally upgrading your gaming setup with a new prebuilt or laptop in 2026, unfortunately, I have more bad news. Acer and Asus will join the growing list of companies passing on the cost of surging memory prices to consumers, which is expected to raise the price of both their commercial business hardware and their consumer PCs early in 2026. We previously reported that Lenovo and HP had already warned customers of upcoming price hikes , while Dell will implement price increases of up to 30% as soon as December 17, according to Business Insider . Now, Commercial Times reports that both Acer CEO Jason Chen and Asus co-CEO Samson Hu have expressed that there is an industry-wide consensus that pricing will reflect spiking memory costs (via TrendForce ). Jason Chen told Commercial Times that once upon a time, memory only accounted for between 8% and 10% of the cost of a PC's Bill of Materials (or BOM). Between Q3 and mid-Q4 of 2025, memory prices rose anywhere between 30% and 50%, in turn seeing the overall BOM jump by between 2% to 3%. While that's not a huge increase, Chen explained that some manufacturers may try to balance costs by lowering specs. Fo…",

It was previously thought that bad actors would need to control a much more significant percentage of any LLM's training data to influence its behaviour, but these recent findings suggest it's actually much easier than that. According to Anthropic, \"Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents.\" For those a little lost, 'poisoning' an AI can take a few different forms.

The Diablo series is known for the secret cow levels that Blizzard playfully refuses to acknowledge despite revisiting the reference in several games. Diablo 4, however, doesn't have one yet, no matter how hard people are still trying to find it with every new update. All the people who haven't given up hope and continue to scour the world for clues were probably thrilled to discover Blizzard quietly included a secret boss event in the latest season. While everyone was busy playing their new paladins , others were playing with body parts dropped from bosses trying to find a use for them. And they figured it out over the weekend. As you cycle through the new seasonal activities, you'll encounter some familiar demon lords from Diablo's story.

An exact date still hasn't been announced, but Marathon is \"targeting\" a price of $40/£40/€35, putting it in line with big-time online shooters Helldivers 2 and Arc Raiders. \"Purchasing Marathon will give you full access to the game, including a roadmap of free gameplay updates as the year progresses,\" Bungie said. \"This will include new maps, new Runner shells, events, and more, starting with the exploration of UESC Marathon's Cryo Archive in Season 1.\" Also like Helldivers, Marathon's reward passes will not expire , and will remain available for purchase even after new passes come out—although to be fair, Helldivers lifted that idea from Halo Infinite .

The studio's second game was an instant hit, introducing a new crowd to extraction shooters with its semi-casual shooting, astonishing maps, and surprisingly chill social dynamics. Sammelin spoke to the huge response to Arc Raiders at launch, touching on the unexpected strategies players have adopted, designing each map to evoke a different playstyle, and how pleased he is to see some players adopting a \"talk first\" approach to PvP. We also asked Sammelin if there's any truth to the theories that Embark matches players partially based on their \"niceness.\" In the example our interviewer gave, it would make sense for Embark to match players who clearly preferred pacifist runs with like-minded raiders, especially in solo Q. Sammelin was cagey about the details, but did confirm that player behavior is a factor in matchmaking. Sammelin: \"Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We do analyze behavior and match accordingly.\" PCG: \"But you can't say anymore?\" …",

You won't be fighting each other though. She's going to help you kill her dad, the Lord of Hatred himself, Mephisto. This probably explains why everyone makes such a big deal about you having Lilith's blood. I've played every season since Diablo 4 was released and someone is always talking about how you have demon blood in you, and it's never made clear why that matters. Her return in Lord of Hatred will be big for all her fans out there, which includes me. A lot of people played through Diablo 4 and wondered what was really wrong with her plan to end the constant fighting between heaven and hell. Sure she's a little manipulative and very evil, but she kind of had a point. The writers who worked on Lord of Hatred are fully aware of the grey area she's in when it comes to her morality. …",
