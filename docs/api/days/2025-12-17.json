Ross was crowned late Tuesday night, Dec. 16, following a festive rendition of Wham’s &#8220;Last Christmas&#8221; with season 23 winner Gina Miles. Earlier on Monday night, Ross featured among the Top 6 finalists, each of whom was tasked with performing two songs — one contemporary and one classic. Ross went with ABBA ’s classic “The Winner Takes It All,” and opened his finals run with JVKE’s “Golden Hour.” Each coach entered the finale with one artist selected from the Playoffs: Ralph Edwards for Snoop Dogg, Aubrey Nicole for Reba McEntire, Ross for Niall Horan, and Jazz McKenzie for Michael Bublé. Two additional finalists — Max Chambers from Team Bublé and DEK of Hearts from Team Niall — earned their spots through viewer votes. When America’s final votes were counted, Horan once again got the rub of the green. The former One Direction star can now boast three consecutive wins as a coach, becoming the first coach in the history of the show to win their first three seasons. The Irishman is just the second coach (after Blake Shelton) to win three in a row. Ross…",

The pair got along like old barfly buddies at The Ripple Room in New York City, as Meyers enticed his guest to play several rounds of drinking games. The day got away not with espresso martinis, but half-pints of beer. Followed by long drags from a punch bowl of Long Island iced tea, and a game of truth or drink. Who did Carpenter write “Manchild” about? Drink. What was the most unhinged thing she’s done to impress a crush? “I don’t think I’ve tried to impress anyone,” Carpenter responded. “That’s such a boring answer.” Yes it is. Meyers then flipped the question. Someone stole an article of clothing from Carpenter&#8217;s house, we learned, to get her attention. Did it work? Sure did. Carpenter turned the tables and had Meyers sing the “The Star-Spangled Banner,” wearing a serious face. Those high notes, however, were best lef…",

The images show the phone in two colorways and reveal its front design as well as a few camera specifications. The device features a 12–71mm telephoto lens, a Sony LYTIA sensor, Dolby Vision support, and OIS. Renders of the so-called Motorola Edge 70 Ultra leaked earlier this month. However, those leaks came with a twist. Soon after the images were leaked, noted tipster Evan Blass claimed that the flagship handset, codenamed Urus, wouldn’t actually be part of the Edge lineup at launch. Instead, Motorola is reportedly positioning it as its first “Signature” device, supposedly a new premium tier for the brand.",

After two rounds of fan voting and recommendations, the rising Mandopop artist clinched the No. 1 spot with his song “Quagmire,” earning him the title of China’s Global No. 1s honoree.

The Opportunities in Research, Business, Innovation, and Technology (ORBIT) challenge is a multi-phase innovation competition designed to empower university and college students to develop next-generation solutions that benefit life on Earth and deep-space exploration. With up to $380,000 in total prize funding, NASA’s ORBIT challenges student teams to bring their most forward-thinking concepts to the table, either utilizing NASA intellectual property or conceptualizing their own. Teams are tasked with conducting targeted research, designing early mockups or models, and performing feasibility analyses to refine their ideas. Finalists then advance to a live showcase where they present their work to a panel of expert judges, who evaluate the proposals and select winners based on the teams&#8217; final pitches and responses to questions. The ORBIT has two challenge tracks for teams to choose from. The ORBIT Earth track requires teams to select a NASA-owned patent and develop novel commercial or nonprofit applications addressing real-world problems. …",

A special slimmed-down wireless charging coil from partner Witz was essential for this ultra-thin design. It’s “Qi2 Ready,” but requires a special magnetic case for accessories, as it has no built-in magnets. Foldables have always fought a war on two fronts: You want a massive screen, but you don’t want a brick in your pocket. With the new Galaxy Z TriFold , Samsung has managed to keep the phone slim, measuring only 12.9mm thick when folded and just 3.9mm when open. Achieving this slim design required impressive engineering, especially when it came to powering the device without needing to plug it in. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A new “Share network” toggle in Wi-Fi settings will let you decide if other users can automatically access a specific network without re-entering the password. Although currently in the Canary channel, this feature is expected to arrive in a future Android update, possibly the Android 16 QPR3 beta. Android allows you to create different user profiles, each with its own apps, files, and settings, enabling multiple people to share a single device. Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network? Currently, there is no way to choose which networks to share; once you connect, every other profile automatically gains access. Soon, however, Android will provide an…",

Battery capacity is rising to 5,200mAh with 30W TurboPower charging, and Motorola claims up to 49 hours of usage per charge. The phone features a Dimensity 6300 chip, stereo speakers, and support for Dolby Atmos. Buying a budget phone often means making trade-offs. You might get a great screen but a weak battery, or a sturdy phone that takes poor photos. For the past few years, Motorola has tried to solve this problem with its G Power series, and now it looks like the company is making another strong attempt. Motorola has announced the Moto G Power 2026, and while it looks familiar, there are some key changes under the hood that might make it the sub-$300 phone to beat in 2026.",

We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

The same report points to shrinking shipments and higher manufacturing costs, pushing smartphone makers to potentially cut specs like RAM and limit budget options. For consumers, this means phones launching next year will be pricier while offering fewer meaningful upgrades. If you’ve been waiting patiently to upgrade your phone in 2026, hoping the next generation of devices will be faster, cheaper, or offer better value, we’ve got some bad news for you. Smartphones will most likely get more expensive and less featureful in the coming year compared to what you can buy today.",

Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Ookla data shows Verizon delivered the fastest mobile download speeds at many major US airports. Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average. Wi-Fi still prevailed at a few locations, but most airports haven’t yet adopted the more recent Wi-Fi standards. As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024.

Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co.

Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

Now, though, things are different. Android tablets are better than ever, and they come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from just larger than a foldable phone to nearly rivaling full-sized laptops. I’m still not sure how many of them I would trust as laptop replacements, but I’ve found that they fill so many more niches than they used to. Here are the best Android tablets that I think you should actually spend your money on.",

From setup to screen size, this $999 Google TV-powered projector delivers a brighter, bigger, and far more effortless viewing experience than a TV at the same price. Suddenly, a flat screen feels less like a staple and more like a convenience I’ve been overvaluing out of habit. If a projector can make me rethink furniture arrangements, budget priorities, and the long-term viability of my current HDMI cable drawer, it’s worth talking about.",

There have been previous leaks and rumors suggesting Samsung was working on such a device. Between the Galaxy Z Fold, Flip, and now the TriFold, Samsung has a full lineup of foldables in its stable. However, it’s believed that the Korean tech giant could add yet another foldable line to its collection. Reports claim that this foldable will have a wider form factor, aimed at competing with Apple’s upcoming iPhone Fold. A possible design for this rumored device may have recently been revealed.

Google formally announced Call Reason at the start of December, saying that beta access would get underway shortly. Testers have now begun to start getting access to Expressive Calling and Call Reason. Do Not Disturb is one of the most useful features our phones have, and often feels like the last line of defense against a world that wants us constantly assailed by notifications. But sometimes someone really, really needs to get in touch with us, so it’s good to know that we have options there, whether that’s designating contacts who can override DND, or recognizing repeat callers by their urgency. With the arrival of QPR2 earlier this month, Google announced another way it was giving us an option to punch through DND — and that’s finally starting to arrive now.

With Gemini enhancing a wide range of modern Google apps , there’s no reason the classic favorites should stay behind.

Google has today announced new upgrades to Translate, powered by enhanced Gemini models. Google doesn’t specify which newer models, but we believe it is referring to the recently announced Gemini 3 and 3 Pro .
