That's obviously a gross overstatement made for comedic effect, but it was really bad —which is why the subsequent turnaround on it is so damn remarkable. We've said at least a couple times in the past that Cyberpunk's redemption arc is complete , but here I am to say it again, because yet another big milestone is now in the rear-view. Cyberpunk 2077 has now sold more than 35 million copies, and that's a hell of an accomplishment for any videogame, but it's still way off the 60 million mark set by The Witcher 3 back in May. As CD Projekt CFO Piotr Nielubowicz explained, however, Cyberpunk has actually surpassed The Witcher 3 in one important measure: It got there faster. (Image credit: CD Projekt (Twitter)) \"Gamers have now purchased over 35 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077,\" Nielubowicz said in comments released as part of today's financial report. \"That's a better result than The Witcher 3 was able to achieve in the same post-release time frame.\" Nielubowicz added that Cyberpunk 2077 is now CD Projekt's \"main source of income,\" having recently received a boost from releases on the …",

I love them because it's pure 'the emperor has no clothes' stuff: cadres of soi-disant tech visionaries desperately trying to gas themselves and everyone else up into not seeing what is clearly in front of them— something which could never be a game at all. Usually, anyway. It turns out that at least one of those viral AI-generated game clips is now being made into, uh, an actual game (via PCGamesN ). But here's the weird part: its creator says it doesn't have any AI-generated stuff in it. Shores of Vaelithar got its start as a viral, five-second clip generated by Midjourney and shared on X by its creator studio, Desimulate. It showed a first-person view of a stylised, lo-fi fantasy game—foreboding castle, rolling green plains and all. The version of the game which now has a Steam page—and, notably, no AI-generated content notice—looks similar but a touch different.

    "body": "The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is one of our favourite handheld gaming PCs, and it would easily sit in the top spot if it weren't for a couple of things: price, and the existence of SteamOS handhelds. On the latter front, though, Microsoft seems to be doing what it can to improve the new handheld-oriented version of Windows towards, well, handhelds, and the latest here is that it's now introduced 'Default Game Profiles.' If you have an ROG Xbox Ally or ROG Xbox Ally X , with this update you should now be able to select profiles for different games tailored to balancing performance and battery life. Xbox says: \"This means smoother, more enjoyable gameplay and extended battery life, without requiring manual adjustments. For example, in Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Default Game Profile can add nearly an hour of battery life compared to Performance mode while still delivering smooth 120 fps gameplay.\" There are currently, at launch, 40 supported games, including Fortnite , Gears of War: Reloaded , and Hollow Knight: Silksong . Though I should note that we were told for the ROG Xbox Ally X launch that there will be \"support for 150+ titles and more to follow\", so watch this space, I suppose. I…",

We're also curious if we'll see some familiar faces. Fallout: New Vegas is packed with interesting and memorable characters, and if I were a betting man I'd wager a few chips that we'll see at least one or two people (or mutants) we know from the games appear in the show. But which characters from Fallout: New Vegas are most (or least) likely to appear in Fallout Season 2? Here are the odds as I see them. Mr. House 🎰 Odds: 1/1 (Image credit: Prime Video) We know for sure Mr. House is in Fallout Season 2—he's shown in the teaser as the pre-war Mr. House, played by Justin Theroux, and in the trailer as the post-war Mr. House, a digital face on a TV screen.

We're in a memory shortage right now, and this applies to both DRAM memory used for RAM and NAND memory used for SSDs, and it will likely also affect GPUs, too. This shortage means there's more demand than supply, which causes prices to rise. We're already seeing RAM prices skyrocket, and prices for SSDs and even GPUs could follow suit before long. We're keeping track of the latest changes to RAM prices here. The cause is mostly the newly booming AI industry, as AI servers require a lot of memory, both in terms of long-term storage and short-term system memory. And many of the same production facilities that make memory for these AI servers also make memory for our RAM, SSDs, and graphics cards, thus why there's an impact on PC gaming hardware.

I'd never equip them until my stash was full and I needed to free up space, and even then, I'd just slap them on whatever gun would accept them, all willy-nilly. It was a means to an end, so to speak, that end being room for more junk, of course. That's not to say I couldn't feel the difference between a naked gun and a decked-out one; I just didn't put much thought into it. Needless to say, it wasn't optimal, in part because I'd entirely underestimated attachments in favour of trying to accumulate a stockpile of the best guns . After watching ModernNik's impressively comprehensive attachment breakdown, I won't be making those same mistakes again. They tested every type of attachment, and even though some of the gains may look small—like a 0.16ms recoil recovery boost from a common stock—it all adds up. By far my biggest takeaway is that the 'quality sweet-spot', for lack of a better term, is often green, uncommon attachments. These offer the most bang for your buck, as blue, rare attachments often come with pesky drawbacks that tend to outweigh the positives, though there are a few excep…",

While these two are technically melee, they're not really when you think about it. Vendetta is almost entirely a sword-slinging brawler with a primary attack that can combo, and that's what makes her different. So when can you play her?

On the bulbous screen of my monitor, I could see some supplies that had gone unpilfered. I sent Hicks—yes, Xenopurge wears its love of Aliens proudly—inside the small room to snatch it, while Morse provided cover, tapping away at my hotkeys to swiftly give them their orders. But the next xeno wave was coming. I'd destroyed the hive, but there were still a couple of locations where aliens from outside could get in. I needed to get my brave lads outta there. I panicked. I fired off the extract command, overriding their programmed logic so that they'd head straight home without getting distracted. Unless an alien slammed into them. Morse got to the door outside the extraction point. Then the red dot appeared. Suddenly it launched itself at Morse—just a subtle movement and change in speed, but somehow still so evocative.

Requiem is a new continuation of the mainline story, meaning you don't need any prior knowledge of Resi to make sense of the unfolding narrative. With a new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, who will explore places of interest in the Resi universe, including a destroyed Raccoon City. But some prior knowledge will help sniff out easter eggs and get a good grasp of how the story will likely unfold. (Image credit: Capcom) To this end, two Resi games will be the most helpful to play. Resident Evil 7 is the first that comes to mind, as this was also directed by Nakanishi and follows a similar structure of introducing a new protagonist who is unfamiliar with combat to the world of Resident Evil. Then there's Resident Evil 2. Nakanishi has explained how Requiem will fall closer to RE2 as opposed to Resident Evil 4 . RE4 is considered to fall on the more action-focused side of the series, while RE2 is thought …",

It's Mature 17+, in case you were wondering. This would suggest that DS2 is due for a release on god's own platform pretty sharpish, which might come as some surprise. It certainly surprised me. After all, the PS5 version of that game only released in June this year, and I still remember writing news stories about ex-PS boss Jim Ryan declaring that PC players would be waiting \" two or three years \" for the platform's exclusives to make the migration. But it wouldn't be so strange for DS2 to jump across so soon after its console launch. Death Stranding 1 , after all, came to PC in July 2020 after its initial PS4 release in November 2019, and it even came with glitzy add-ons, like a photo mode and some crossover stuff. I wouldn't be surprised if the second game got the same treatment. Of course, Sony and Kojim…",

    "body": "Trials in Arc Raiders is effectively a ranking system where you compete against other players for high scores on five challenges each week. When you complete a task for this week's challenges, you'll earn points towards that objective and earn a place on the leaderboard. The competition can get intense, to say the least. But if you're looking to earn all the unique Trials rewards, you're going to need to step up to the plate and give it a shot. Below, I'll go over all the Trials challenges this week and the best way to complete them for a high score. Arc Raiders Trials this week (Image credit: Embark) Right off the bat, it's important to understand how scoring works. Firstly, only your personal best score during a single run for each challenge contributes to your overall ranking, so you need to be prepared. Secondly, you can earn double Trial Score points when map conditions are active , such as Night Raid, Electromagnetic Storm, and Hidden Bunker, so you're always best off attempting the challenges on these runs. Plus, it's basically always easier to attempt these with two other players, not just because it's easier to stay alive, but also because the score is often shared, letti…",

    "body": "Intel's long awaited Panther Lake CPU has made an appearance in the Geekbench results browser (via Videocardz ). And the early numbers look, well, kind of okay. According to the Geekbench entry , we're talking 2,849 single-core points and 15,434 multi-core points. Arguably, it's the single-core result that's most interesting as it theoretically allows for a direct comparison between different generations of Intel Performance cores. The multi-core comparison is complicated by the vagaries of difference Performance, Efficient and Low Power Efficient core configurations, albeit the total result is, ultimately, the total result. The specific Panther Lake model appearing in the Geekbench results is the Core Ultra 9 386H, a mobile CPU as all Panther Lake chips will be at launch. It shows up as a 16-core model on Geekbench and is expected to have four Performance, eight Efficient, and four Low Power Efficient cores. The closest existing Intel CPU for comparison is the Core Ultra 9 285H, which is a similarly configured 16-core mobile chip, albeit with six Performance and two Low Power Efficient cores.

    "body": "When Battlefield 6 launched a month and a half ago, one of its most anticipated features basically didn't work. The Portal server browser was a dumpster fire at first, hosting dozens upon dozens of lazy XP farms that clogged up EA's servers so bad you couldn't even start your own friend lobby. Then, DICE nerfed XP farms into the ground. Folks complained, some who apparently only bought BF6 to shoot at bots demanded refunds, and many XP farming servers were taken offline. Now weeks later, I decided to check in on the BF6's Portal tab, hoping to find folks using Portal the way I hoped they would from the start: creating neat custom games and hosting specialized servers. I'm pleased to report both are happening, but not in huge amounts. First, the good news: Legitimately fun custom games are starting to pop up, several of which resemble the sort of goofy stuff you'd find perusing the custom lobbies of Halo or Garry's Mod. The most popular one of the moment is Chaos Climb by Forstorare (Portal code: zx45f) . Instead of describing it, I'd rather show you what it's all about: To me, this is videogames. What I dig about Chaos Climb is how it flexes the one big thing that Portal has that …",

It should make Charlie very happy, then, that Cazorla is getting credit for his effort: Not from the awards shows, which unfortunately don't generally pay much attention to mocap work, but from the internet at large. \"Thank you for all the messages these past few days,\" Cazorla wrote on X (via GamesRadar ) shortly after Cox's comments came to light. \"Charlie’s words were incredibly generous, and I’m truly grateful. Bringing Gustave to life was a team effort, and I’m honored to have played my part in it.

Well, today is November 25, and yeah, you can probably see where I'm going with this. The Battlefield 6 free trial is live! One thing interesting (and, I think, new) about the Battlefield 6 free trial is that you don't access it through Battlefield 6, as you might expect; if you hop around to the BF6 Steam page , you'll see there's no sort of \"try me free!\" option available. Instead, you get to it through Battlefield Redsec , the battle royale mode, which is always free to play. But during the trial period, you'll also have access to three playlists, including a \"casual multiplayer experience,\" across three maps: Siege of Cairo, Eastwood, and Blackwell Fields.\" In a nice nod to newcomers, EA also provided a handy breakdown of each game mode available in the trial, as well as some tips on how to play them effectively . So if you don't know what Escalation is, for instance, or how to play it in a way that will actually be useful to your team, this is a way to get a sense of the basics without ge…",

It might be just what you need, too—especially now that Reforged has its own private multiplayer servers, the headline feature of its recent 2.0 update . Even more ambitiously than the popular Seamless Co-op mod (which is also fully supported here), Reforged bypasses the original game's anti-cheat systems while retaining bloodstains, phantoms, summons and invasions. Helpful, as there are more than 1,200 collectible stat-boosting rune fragments hidden throughout the entire game like Crackdown's irresistible agility orbs, many of which you'd never find without other kindly players placing glowing, tongue-in-cheek hints.

Eleventh Hour Games broke its silence on whether you'll have to pay for Last Epoch's upcoming Orobyss expansion after spending years—as an indie developer—promising players everything would be free. The answer is no: Last Epoch's expansion will be free to anyone who already owns the base game, and it will be packed in for anyone who buys the game after it's out. Last month, EHG founder Judd Cobler said the studio would \"maybe\" have to charge something for the expansion, as the game's first three seasons haven't been profitable. But now it looks like EHG will hold to the promise it made when it ran a Kickstarter for the game in 2018. There's a small catch here though: Alongside the expansion a new \"Paradox class\" will be released and it will have a price that won't be revealed until later. In the announcement post on Reddit, Cobler describes it as a \"fully alternate playable class built on systems that work differently from anything else in the game.\" T…",

Based on what I'm seeing from upcoming co-op angling game How to Fish, however, I've apparently missed some critical bits of the fishing equation. Bits like whipping a fish out of the water so you can quick-scope it in midair with a bolt-action rifle for bonus XP. The description on the How to Fish Steam listing doesn't do it justice: \"You and your friends are out drinking and boating. You crash into a small island where you have to fish using everything from fishing rods to assault rifles,\" it explains. \"Sell your catch, earn money, buy better fishing gear, and defeat boss fishes to unlock new islands and finally make it back home.\" We've been living in a post- Ridiculous Fishing world of absurdist angling for years. But what catches my eye about How to Fish is the speed of its 0-100 acceleration from traditional fishing to physics-based guntoting dipshittery. In the trailer, there's a scant two seconds before the player is unloading an uzi magazine into a fresh catch so it can be grilled for money, ear…",

The studio issued a hotfix on November 17 for its biggest troublemaker, Fallout 4's Creations Menu, and shared plans for more on November 24, followed by another update sometime in December.

In other words, GOG's done some work on this one. \"The new GOG release of Cold Fear isn’t just a reappearance on a storefront—it’s a quality re-release with extensive under-the-hood work,\" reads the blurb. That means Windows 10/11 support, support for 4K and high refresh rates, modern controller support, and patches for common crashes and glitches—just generally the gubbins you need to launch a game with confidence on a PC in 2025. You can find the full changelog on GOG . Also, it's not alone. Alongside the Cold Fear re-release, GOG's adding Ubisoft's 2012 action-adventure game I Am Alive to its storefront and lineup of preserved titles. That game has gotten a spit-polish too, with support for online achievements, cloud saves, high refresh rates, modern controllers, and various bugfixes and such. As a 2005 game, our review of Cold Fear is lost to the mists of time (that's what we call the closet filled with the last 30-plus years of magazines), but our review of I Am Alive is…",

    "body": "I was so conflicted when I first started working on this review of the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 10 . I came into it with this expectation that it was going to be a simple, easy, plug-and-play, get-it-tested-and-done article. A lengthy piece about a $4,000 laptop, brimming with hardware, glowing with accolades and triumphs on its legendary performance and impressive build quality. Yet on my first bout with the Gen 10, it left me sorely disappointed, more so because of my own hubris and oversight than because of the laptop itself. The thing is, I didn't know it then, I didn't understand what it was capable of, and after multiple weeks of testing, re-testing, and really getting under the skin of the Legion 9i, I am now a convert. Hands-down, it is, without a doubt, one of the best gaming laptops I've ever had the privilege of playing with. Albeit with a few minor caveats to that glowing recommendation. So, let's start with the specs first, because it's a whole cornucopia of madness depending on which side of that big Atlantic fish-pond you live on.
