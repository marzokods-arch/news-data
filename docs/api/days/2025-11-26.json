    "body": "Trials in Arc Raiders is effectively a ranking system where you compete against other players for high scores on five challenges each week. When you complete a task for this week's challenges, you'll earn points towards that objective and earn a place on the leaderboard. The competition can get intense, to say the least. But if you're looking to earn all the unique Trials rewards, you're going to need to step up to the plate and give it a shot. Below, I'll go over all the Trials challenges this week and the best way to complete them for a high score. Arc Raiders Trials this week (Image credit: Embark) Right off the bat, it's important to understand how scoring works. Firstly, only your personal best score during a single run for each challenge contributes to your overall ranking, so you need to be prepared. Secondly, you can earn double Trial Score points when map conditions are active , such as Night Raid, Electromagnetic Storm, and Hidden Bunker, so you're always best off attempting the challenges on these runs. Plus, it's basically always easier to attempt these with two other players, not just because it's easier to stay alive, but also because the score is often shared, letti…",

    "body": "Intel's long awaited Panther Lake CPU has made an appearance in the Geekbench results browser (via Videocardz ). And the early numbers look, well, kind of okay. According to the Geekbench entry , we're talking 2,849 single-core points and 15,434 multi-core points. Arguably, it's the single-core result that's most interesting as it theoretically allows for a direct comparison between different generations of Intel Performance cores. The multi-core comparison is complicated by the vagaries of difference Performance, Efficient and Low Power Efficient core configurations, albeit the total result is, ultimately, the total result. The specific Panther Lake model appearing in the Geekbench results is the Core Ultra 9 386H, a mobile CPU as all Panther Lake chips will be at launch. It shows up as a 16-core model on Geekbench and is expected to have four Performance, eight Efficient, and four Low Power Efficient cores. The closest existing Intel CPU for comparison is the Core Ultra 9 285H, which is a similarly configured 16-core mobile chip, albeit with six Performance and two Low Power Efficient cores. It scores 2,608 single-core points and 14,812 multi-core points . In that context, Intel…",

Embracer will retain the publishing rights to the popular, Soulslike-infused shooters Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant 2. These will be transferred to THQ Nordic, which already owns the IP rights and Remnant's developer Gunfire Games. The rights to Fellowship are also being transferred, but these will be handed over to Satisfactory developer and publisher Coffee Stain, which will be spun off from Embracer to become a publicly traded company on December 11. \"This transaction supports our key priorities by strengthening our focus on strategic assets and core IPs in Embracer while improving profitability and free cash flow,\" Embracer CEO Phil Rogers said in a state…",

(ملحوظة): جميع الإجابات، بما يمكن أن تتضمنه من أخطاء لغوية أو معلوماتية، أوردناها كما ذكرها الذكاء الاصطناعي. الإجابة النتيجة المتوقعَة: آرسنال 2‑2 بايرن ميونخ &nbsp;لماذا 2‑2؟ - كلا الفريقين يدخلان المباراة برصيد مثالي، مع 4 انتصارات من 4 مواجهات في المجموعة. بايرن يتصدّر بفارق الأهداف، وآرسنال خلفه مباشرة. - رغم تفوق بايرن تاريخيا على آرسنال، يقدم الأخير هذا الموسم أداء دفاعيا جيدا، ولم تستقبل شباكه أي هدف في دوري الأبطال حتى الآن. - من جهة أخرى، بايرن يملك خط هجوم قوي جدا، وسجل 14 هدفا في دور المجموعات، مع هدافه القوي الذي دخل التاريخ أمام آرسنال. - عادة مواجهات الفريقين تنتهي بسيطرة بايرن أو بتعادلات عديدة، مما يجعل النتيجة متوازنة (تعادل مفتوح) مثل 2-2 خيار منطقي ومثير — خصوصا إن اعتمد آرسنال على سرعة جناحي الهجوم مثل بوكايو ساكا. تصريحات كومباني تمنى فنسنت كومباني المدير الفني لباير…",

The Portal server browser was a dumpster fire at first, hosting dozens upon dozens of lazy XP farms that clogged up EA's servers so bad you couldn't even start your own friend lobby. Then, DICE nerfed XP farms into the ground. Folks complained, some who apparently only bought BF6 to shoot at bots demanded refunds, and many XP farming servers were taken offline. Now weeks later, I decided to check in on the BF6's Portal tab, hoping to find folks using Portal the way I hoped they would from the start: creating neat custom games and hosting specialized servers. I'm pleased to report both are happening, but not in huge amounts. First, the good news: Legitimately fun custom games are starting to pop up, several of which resemble the sort of goofy stuff you'd find perusing the custom lobbies of Halo or Garry's Mod. The most popular one of the moment is Chaos Climb by Forstorare (Portal code: zx45f) . Instead of describing it, I'd rather show you what it's all about: To me, this is videogames.

It should make Charlie very happy, then, that Cazorla is getting credit for his effort: Not from the awards shows, which unfortunately don't generally pay much attention to mocap work, but from the internet at large. \"Thank you for all the messages these past few days,\" Cazorla wrote on X (via GamesRadar ) shortly after Cox's comments came to light. \"Charlie’s words were incredibly generous, and I’m truly grateful. Bringing Gustave to life was a team effort, and I’m honored to have played my part in it.

Well, today is November 25, and yeah, you can probably see where I'm going with this. The Battlefield 6 free trial is live! One thing interesting (and, I think, new) about the Battlefield 6 free trial is that you don't access it through Battlefield 6, as you might expect; if you hop around to the BF6 Steam page , you'll see there's no sort of \"try me free!\" option available. Instead, you get to it through Battlefield Redsec , the battle royale mode, which is always free to play. But during the trial period, you'll also have access to three playlists, including a \"casual multiplayer experience,\" across three maps: Siege of Cairo, Eastwood, and Blackwell Fields.\" In a nice nod to newcomers, EA also provided a handy breakdown of each game mode available in the trial, as well as some tips on how to play them effectively . So if you don't know what Escalation is, for instance, or how to play it in a way that will actually be useful to your team, this is a way to get a sense of the basics without ge…",

It might be just what you need, too—especially now that Reforged has its own private multiplayer servers, the headline feature of its recent 2.0 update . Even more ambitiously than the popular Seamless Co-op mod (which is also fully supported here), Reforged bypasses the original game's anti-cheat systems while retaining bloodstains, phantoms, summons and invasions. Helpful, as there are more than 1,200 collectible stat-boosting rune fragments hidden throughout the entire game like Crackdown's irresistible agility orbs, many of which you'd never find without other kindly players placing glowing, tongue-in-cheek hints. This mod understands that even playing solo, Elden Ring is a shared experience. It just wouldn't be the same without people declaring that every single turtle is actually a dog.

At least not yet. Eleventh Hour Games broke its silence on whether you'll have to pay for Last Epoch's upcoming Orobyss expansion after spending years—as an indie developer—promising players everything would be free. The answer is no: Last Epoch's expansion will be free to anyone who already owns the base game, and it will be packed in for anyone who buys the game after it's out. Last month, EHG founder Judd Cobler said the studio would \"maybe\" have to charge something for the expansion, as the game's first three seasons haven't been profitable. But now it looks like EHG will hold to the promise it made when it ran a Kickstarter for the game in 2018. There's a small catch here though: Alongside the expansion a new \"Paradox class\" will be released and it will have a price that won't be revealed until later. In the announcement post on Reddit, Cobler describes it as a \"fully alternate playable class built on systems that work differently from anything else in the game.\" T…",

First, there was the predictable: The servers blew out when the open beta went live. Then two weeks later came the unpredictable, when 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx went onstage at The Game Awards in a MAGA-style hat .

Still, there are plenty in what remains of the community with doubts about the wisdom of smushing two sci-fi franchises together. I found it reassuring to hear the game's narrative director Alison Lührs admit that the first thing the Bungie team asked when they sat down with LucasFilm in San Francisco was: 'What's the bad version of this?'\" I guess it made sense to get the image of Jar Jar Binks hurling a Nova Bomb out of the way early.

Players seemed to enjoy the combination of cozy shop simulator and dungeon crawling roguelite, inspired by the Rogue Legacies and Stardew Valleys of the time. Some grumbled about a lack of depth and incentive to keep returning to the dungeon again and again, and seven years later developer Digital Sun is ready to show us what it’s learned from those criticisms. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is now available in early access on Steam. I spent several hours with it over the past week, and it already feels like a more focused and refined version of the original. The premise remains unchanged: you play as Will, a shopkeep-slash-dungeoneer who is looking to turn his spoils into cold hard cash. The core loop involves diving into randomized dungeons, fighting the monsters there, filling your backpack with loot, selling it for a tidy profit, and doing it all again. Inventory management itself is a puzzle, as items interact with each other in your backpack, forcing you to think carefully about how you use the limited space.

It encourages players to get on the move by listening to episodic post-apocalyptic stories, interval training while actively 'running from zombies,' and supplies rewards from workout sessions to upgrade their survival base. Alderman co-created the app and wrote its years' worth of voice-acted, episodic stories that have amassed over 10 million users since 2012.

That Skyrim mod was down to game developer and modder Trainwiz (and friends), who notes in his Bluesky bio that \"Mattel is out to kill me.\" This is because toy giant Mattel owns the rights to the Thomas the Tank Engine characters, and doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humour about Thomas mods. Thus, we arrive at a new frontier for Thomas-based heroics.

The description on the How to Fish Steam listing doesn't do it justice: \"You and your friends are out drinking and boating. You crash into a small island where you have to fish using everything from fishing rods to assault rifles,\" it explains. \"Sell your catch, earn money, buy better fishing gear, and defeat boss fishes to unlock new islands and finally make it back home.\" We've been living in a post- Ridiculous Fishing world of absurdist angling for years.

The Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition launched on November 10 as an all-encompassing collection of DLC and add-ons, but a related update to Fallout 4's Creation Club menu rolled out for everyone who owns the game and caused issues with certain existing mods. Shortly after tanking Fallout 4's \"very positive\" review average on Steam, Bethesda said it was investigating reports of new bugs, performance issues, and crashes introduced with the Creations Menu Update that went out alongside the Anniversary Edition . The studio issued a hotfix on November 17 for its biggest troublemaker, Fallout 4's Creations Menu, and shared plans for more on November 24, followed by another update sometime in December. Bethesda made good on some performance fixes last Friday, on November 21, when it published a follow up Steam blog with patch notes to address stability and crash issues. Though that's not the fix some modding diehards want, with threads on Reddit from players who sound like they'd rather the update just not exist to begin with. And …",

Now? Well, kind of the same thing again. As captured by the good folk at Posta Entretenimiento , Cox was recently asked how he felt about his Game Awards nomination for best performance, and almost immediately disavowed 95% of the credit. \"I'm thrilled for this nomination,\" said Cox. \"I've said this before, and I think it's important to say that there's an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla, who did almost all of the motion capture for that role, in that game.\" What bearing does that have on Cox's TGA nom? \"So, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him.\" Which is really quite charming, and in an industry where so much vital mocap work ends up becoming kind of invisible—we all know Geralt's voice actor Doug Cockle, but far fewer of us could name Maciej Kwiatkowski, who does his mocap—it's definitely an important point to make.

Researchers at security services provider Huntress have detailed the novel new method in a blog post , and it's quite the feat of social engineering. Essentially, a browser window containing a full-screen version of what looks to be a Windows Update screen launches, with the familiar blue background (although with a suspicious-looking font).

Every character can also sprint along the ground or fly in the sky for an unlimited amount of time, making it easy to get a good grasp of the battlefield.

    "body": "I was so conflicted when I first started working on this review of the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 10 . I came into it with this expectation that it was going to be a simple, easy, plug-and-play, get-it-tested-and-done article. A lengthy piece about a $4,000 laptop, brimming with hardware, glowing with accolades and triumphs on its legendary performance and impressive build quality. Yet on my first bout with the Gen 10, it left me sorely disappointed, more so because of my own hubris and oversight than because of the laptop itself. The thing is, I didn't know it then, I didn't understand what it was capable of, and after multiple weeks of testing, re-testing, and really getting under the skin of the Legion 9i, I am now a convert. Hands-down, it is, without a doubt, one of the best gaming laptops I've ever had the privilege of playing with. Albeit with a few minor caveats to that glowing recommendation. So, let's start with the specs first, because it's a whole cornucopia of madness depending on which side of that big Atlantic fish-pond you live on. The model I have here for review is the 18IAX10, complete with Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and RTX 5080 16 GB (capped at a beautiful 1…",

Look at those things. \"Ready up with this controller-meets-clog design that reimagines the iconic Xbox controller with fixed buttons and joysticks into the perfect shoe for couch co-op and kicking back,\" goes the Xbox marketing blurb, like it's describing something perfectly normal and not an abrogation of humanity's duty to treat the Earth's fruits with care and respect. The part I find most displeasing, personally, are the analogue sticks, which arise like malignant fungal nodules from the dorsa of both of your feet. On the plus side, I guess the clogs as a whole do look quite breathable. The Crocs go on sale on November 25 (which is today), which I hope is not useful information for you, and will cost $80.

At a time when layoffs abound, projects are cancelled at a moment's notice, and work in the games industry is more difficult to find than ever, designers being able to show potential employers the work they've done is vital. Hence, diligent, accurate crediting is important for any creative's career, as well as just being the decent thing to do. In most cases, a credit is formulated as the developer's name and the nature of their role on the project, whether that's a fixed job title or a specific type of work they contributed on a part-time or freelance basis. But with the credits for Demonschool , developer Necrosoft Games went one step further, adding paragraph-long descriptions for every role on the project. This was highlighted by Necrosoft's design director Brandon Sheffield, who posted an image of some of Demonschool's credit to demonstrate their approach. \"Often you see credits in games where you don't know what the credited developer was actually responsible for.

It's doubled the single-core performance of its in-house chips, the M-series, in five years, and while the predicted single-core score in Geekbench 6 for the new M5 was 4100 (based on the M5 iPad Pro), in my actual testing of a 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro that figure is 4310. You know what else scores 4310 points in that test? Nothing. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D ? 3332. The Core i9 14900KS? 3238. The Core Ultra 9 285K ? 3214. When Apple claimed the ARM-based M5 had the best single-core performance in the world, it sure meant it. But can it game? While you used to be able to buy desktop Macs with Radeon cards in them, we haven't seen that for a while, and no M-series processor has yet been paired with any kind of discrete GPU. Apple instead relies on the integrated graphics cores and, for more powerful desktop machines, its ability to literally glue multiple chips together to increase their number, brute-forcing a solution to the problem by throwing more silicon at it. I tried it out already with an extraordinarily expensive Mac Studio containing a 16-core M4 Max CPU with a 40-core GPU, but what I'm attempting t…",

The Golden Joysticks just wrapped up, The Game Awards are coming, and to kill some time in between you can now nominate your games of choice for the 2025 Steam Awards . I'd actually wondered how Steam Awards nominations would be handled in 2025. Typically it happens during the Steam Autumn Sale, but with Valve moving the Autumn Sale back a couple months to give us a proper break before the Winter Sale hits, that wasn't going to be an option. The answer was obvious in hindsight: Just make a whole other sale and cram it in there, which is exactly what Valve did with Steam's first ever Black Friday Sale . The nomination process for this year's Steam Awards will simplify things for you by listing eligible games you've played in 2025, as well as providing a rundown of \"popular and recommended games\" if you're more interested in being on the winning team than in throwing your support behind something you actually enjoyed. There seems to be some kind of obscure eligibility requirements for the recommendation listings, although I haven't been able to suss out exactly what: For the Bes…",

It's no surprise that most BF6 players have made a habit of ignoring the LGT entirely by choosing to spawn directly on capture points or even run out of the HQ instead.

Earlier today on the Battlefield subreddit, he posted a screenshot of something that I'd wager nobody else has seen in the wild: the Mad Max-ified \"Gold Standard\" skin for the LGT jeep, a reward for reaching rank 50 with the vehicle. \"Rank 50 for the death trap, never removing this badge,\" he wrote alongside the image. \"How,\" one commenter, who understood the implication of reaching the maximum level on a vehicle that's more likely to kill you than help you, replied.

Tavern Keeper arrived on Steam in November, but it's been in development for over a decade—and as impressive as the game is, that's a heck of a long development cycle, especially since it's expected to be in early access for at least another 12 months. I spoke last week with Patrick Klug, director and co-founder of Greenheart Games, and asked why the tavern sim took so long to belly up to the bar. \"We have made, like, six versions of this over the last 11 and a half years,\" Klug said, explaining that just the storybook system alone went through \"dozens of versions\" to become what is essentially an \"interactive audiobook\" where players get to make RPG-like dialogue choices while managing their pub. \"When we started, there were no tavern [management] games.

Because for the first time ever, Valve has capitulated to the gods of e-commerce and is holding its very own Black Friday Sale . Unlike many online retailers, who view Black Friday as one of the most important sell stuff holidays* of the year, Steam's Black Friday Sale is a relatively small affair compared to the seasonal heavyweights: It runs for just one week, and there are no attendant Points Shop freebies or trading cards to earn for hammering through your discovery queue.

But seeing you enjoy the game makes us feel better.\" Stuff like server issues and bugs can be fixed, of course, though people also have issues with Tarkov's full release that aren't going away: primarily, existing owners having to re-buy the game on Steam. That's not going to change, though presumably the disquiet will die down over time (and while it would've been nice, existing owners can of course still play through the Battlestate launcher). Buyanov went on to discuss the near future for the game in the runup to the new year, though stopped short of offering any details on the long-teased Scav Life DLC, w…",

    "body": "Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 released last month after a lengthy, difficult development, one that saw the project taken off original developer Hardsuit Labs by publisher Paradox Interactive and handed over to The Chinese Room. When it finally burst from its coffin, the critical reaction ranged from mildly positive to firmly negative, with our own Fraser Brown giving it a respectable score of 78 in our Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 review. Yet whether players liked it or not, pretty much everyone agreed that The Chinese Room's sequel wasn't really a successor to Bloodlines at all, lacking the ridiculous roleplaying depth that makes Troika's original the brilliantly broken bloodsucking adventure it is. In fact, PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens pointed out that the biggest problem with Bloodlines 2 is that it is called Bloodlines 2 . As is so often the case, it appears Bloodlines 2's adoptive developers were highly aware of this potential problem. Speaking to Cat Burton of the Goth Boss Podcast (via PCGamesN ) TCR cofounder Dan Pinchbeck explained how he urged Paradox Interactive not to call Bloodlines 2, well, that . Pinchbeck says that, from the start, The Chinese Room inten…",

All of that could go some way to explaining why hundreds of thousands of people believed Google was scraping users' emails to train Google Gemini based on Google's own wording. Just last week, a viral X post managed to amass almost 150,000 likes (at the time of writing), claiming, \"You have been automatically OPTED IN to allow Gmail to access all your private messages & attachments to train AI models.\" Talking to The Verge , Google spokesperson Jenny Thomson claims, “These reports are misleading—we have not changed anyone’s settings, Gmail Smart Features have existed for many years, and we do not use your Gmail content for training our Gemini AI model.” So, I hear you ask, what happened? Effectively, under the smart features options, Google clarifies that Gmail, Google Chat, and Google Meet \"use your content and activity in these products to provide smart features and personalize your experience.\" The relative vagueness of this description, plus the use of 's…",

Hashino also discussed how he's gearing up for what sounds like a literal upgrade to the JRPG genre, except there are no patch notes yet. As reported by 4gamer and translated by GamesRadar , Hashino sees the genre as three distinct eras—the past (JRPG 1.0), present (JRPG 2.0), and future (JRPG 3.0). The ' ghosts of JRPG past, present, and future ' would have switched up the story of A Christmas Carol a bit, and now I'm wondering what that looks like. According to Hashino, JRPG 1.0 encompasses the \"classics\", which is not a small number of enduring pioneers, including Final Fantasy—which continues to release entries to this day after more than 35 years—alongside Atlus' own Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series. JRPG 2.0 is the genre as it is now, the modern iteration with \"its current style, which feels higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player\"…",
