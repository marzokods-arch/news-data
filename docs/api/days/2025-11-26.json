If you’ve been eyeing an upgrade before the holiday chaos hits, the savings are hard to ignore. The standout is the Dreame X50 Ultra, a high-end robot vacuum built for homes where most bots still get tripped up. Its chassis can lift itself to climb over thresholds and door sills, and the corner-reaching system helps it clean further into tight spots than you normally get from a round robot. It also handles hair better thanks to its detangling brush setup, and the base station washes and dries the mop pads with high heat, so you’re not left dealing with damp fibers. With the price falling from $1,599.99 to just $799.99 for Black Friday, it’s one of the biggest drops in Dreame’s lineup.",

I think we&#8217;ve accomplished that.” Indeed they have, especially this year, where many participating record labels go deep into their vaults to give the informed music-buying public incentive to venture out of their house and outside the doorway of their nearest participating record shop, including exclusives from Benson Boone, Cage the Elephant, Curren$y, Dr. Dre, Billie Eilish, Fred again.., Briston Maroney, Bruno Mars, Role Model and Talking…",

Brown kicked off 2025 with the best R&amp;B album Grammy for his latest album 11:11 (Deluxe) — his second win in that category after 13 years. He’s now closing out the year with two more nominations for the 2026 Grammy ceremony: best R&amp;B song and best R&amp;B performance for “It Depends” featuring Bryson Tiller, which peaked at No. 16 on the Hot 100.

One of them is a circular speaker, which can either rest on a table or be mounted on a wall. The other is a lamp-speaker combo with color shades inspired by soft-serve ice cream. Besides playing audio over Bluetooth, these speakers also support Spotify Tap for easy access to your playlists. In addition to its ease of assembly and affordability, what helps IKEA furniture stand apart from the crowd (of other mass-produced furniture) is its inviting vibe and minimal aesthetic. Gladly, its wares extend beyond what has a few feet and sits on the ground. And one category that IKEA has absolutely crushed is obfuscated, visually stunning wireless speakers. IKEA previously offered Wi-Fi-based speakers in partnership with Sonos under its Symfonisk lineup. Since that has come to an end, IKEA has been exploring its own creations. It has now added two new speaker ranges to its inventory in partnership with Swedish designer Tekla Evelina Severin, who’s popularly known as “Teklan.”",

    "body": "أعلنت المحكمة الرياضية الدولية \"كاس\"، اليوم الأربعاء، إيقاف لاعب بيراميدز الدولي رمضان صبحي لمدة أربع سنوات، عقب اتهامه بالتلاعب في العينة الخاصة باختبار الكشف عن المنشطات. وجاء القرار، الذي يعد الأشد في تاريخ اللاعب، بعد سلسلة من التطورات والتحقيقات التي استمرت عدة أشهر، ليضع رمضان صبحي أمام واحدة من أصعب المحطات في مسيرته الكروية. جذور القضية تعود جذور القضية إلى الأشهر الماضية عندما تم سحب عينة تحليل منشطات عشوائية من اللاعب عقب إحدى مباريات فريقه في بطولة كأس الكونفدرالية الأفريقية عام 2021. ووفقًا لما كشفته مصادر كووورة، فقد أظهرت العينة الأولى \"قراءات غير نمطية\"، من بينها ارتفاع نسبة الماء وتغيرات في مكونات العينة بشكل لا يتوافق مع المعدلات الفسيولوجية الطبيعية للإنسان. هذا الأمر دفع المختبر المعتمد لدى الكاس، والذي أجرى الفحص، إلى اعتبار العينة \"مريبة\" وسط احتمالات تشير إلى حدوث تدخل خارجي أو تلاعب. وبناءً على ذلك، تم إخطار اللاعب وناديه بضرورة حضور جلسة استماع لتوضيح الموقف، وهي خطوة إلزامية بموجب لوائح الوكالة الدولية لمكافحة المنشطات \"وادا\".. ولكن، مع تصاعد الحديث في الإعلام، بدأ الجدل يزداد حدة حول احتمال تعرض اللاعب لعقوبة قاسية في حال ثبوت التلاعب. قرار كاس شهدت القضية عدة جلسات استماع خلال الفترة الماضية، شارك فيها رمضان صبحي والمحامي الخاص به، فضلا عن ممثلين عن نادي…",

Released in 2024, it was one of the most powerful “small” handhelds, with an 8 Gen 2 SoC and PSP Vita vibes. AYN still sells the Odin 2, as well as the Odin 2 Portal, Thor, and Odin 3. When it comes to smaller Android gaming handhelds with enough power for demanding systems, your options are surprisingly limited. The Odin 2 Mini was one of the first to really fill that niche, with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 packed into a relatively small frame with a 5-inch screen. But now, that device is no longer on the market. Confirmed by a representative on Discord , the AYN Odin 2 Mini has been discontinued and removed from the company’s website. This was not announced in advance, nor was it made public on any of the company’s channels.",

    "body": "تكشف الصور واللقطات القادمة من مباريات ليفربول هذا الموسم عن أزمة ذهنية عميقة داخل الفريق، بعد سلسلة نتائج سلبية أطاحت بـ\"روح البطل\" التي تميز بها في عهد يورجن كلوب. وفي ظل تراجع الأداء وتعدد الأخطاء، أصبحت الإشارات السلبية المهيمنة على لغة الجسد عنوانا واضحا للأزمة، بداية من اختفاء ابتسامة محمد صلاح، مرورا بغضب فيرجيل فان دايك، وصولا إلى انهيار إبراهيما كوناتي عند استبداله. إذا كان الفوز على أستون فيلا وريال مدريد قد منح انطباعا بأن ليفربول يسير في الاتجاه الصحيح، فإن الهزائم أمام مانشستر سيتي ونوتنجهام فورست كانت ضربة موجعة أعادت الفريق إلى النصف السفلي في جدول الدوري الإنجليزي الممتاز. وأشار موقع \"ذي أتلتيك\" قبل أسبوعين إلى 11 مشكلة يجب حلها كي يستعيد ليفربول زخمه، لكن الواقع أن المزيد من المشكلات قد ظهرت، إذ خسر الفريق المباريات الست التي استقبل فيها الهدف الأول هذا الموسم، على عكس الموسم الماضي حين كان الأكثر قدرة على العودة من التأخر. خلال فترة كلوب، ارتبط ليفربول بلقب “الوحوش الذهنية”، وأنعش آرني سلوت هذه السمعة في بدايته، لكن الموسم الجاري يسير في اتجاه معاكس، ويمكن ملاحظة ذلك بسهولة في تفاعل الجماهير مع الأنباء التي تتعلق بتحليل لغة الجسد داخل الريدز، والتي تحولت إلى محور نقاش بين محللين بارزين. وقالت الصحيفة البريطانية: \"لا يدّعي أحد أن لغة الجسد هي سبب الفوز بالألقاب أو…",

Server owners can bypass this fee for their users if they subscribe to a Plex Pass themselves.

Projections from the market research firm indicate that iPhone shipments are expected to grow by approximately 10% in 2025, while Samsung’s Galaxy line shipments are estimated to increase by only 4.6%. That’s a major gap for two companies often assumed neck-and-neck. On a global level, Apple is projected to grab around 19.4% of total smartphone shipments this year — a threshold not seen since 2011 (via Bloomberg ).",

The Ultra phone otherwise offers a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, a 6,500mAh battery, and a 50MP 5x periscope camera. Xiaomi-affiliated POCO has been upping its game in recent years, and the POCO F7 Ultra was the firm’s first Ultra device. Now, POCO is back with the POCO F8 series, which consists of Pro and Ultra handsets. The POCO F8 Pro and Ultra are effectively rebranded, global versions of the China-only Redmi K90 and Redmi K90 Pro Max . The Pro and Ultra devices only have a few things in common, though. Expect the handsets to offer 100W wired charging speeds, an IP68 rating, an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor, the same display brightness figures, and the Hyper OS 3 skin. Both phones also get four major Android OS upgrades and six years of security patches. However, it’s clear that the Ultra handset is the standout offering here, and not just because of the traditional spec sheet.",

(ملحوظة): جميع الإجابات، بما يمكن أن تتضمنه من أخطاء لغوية أو معلوماتية، أوردناها كما ذكرها الذكاء الاصطناعي. الإجابة النتيجة المتوقعَة: آرسنال 2‑2 بايرن ميونخ &nbsp;لماذا 2‑2؟ - كلا الفريقين يدخلان المباراة برصيد مثالي، مع 4 انتصارات من 4 مواجهات في المجموعة. بايرن يتصدّر بفارق الأهداف، وآرسنال خلفه مباشرة. - رغم تفوق بايرن تاريخيا على آرسنال، يقدم الأخير هذا الموسم أداء دفاعيا جيدا، ولم تستقبل شباكه أي هدف في دوري الأبطال حتى الآن. - من جهة أخرى، بايرن يملك خط هجوم قوي جدا، وسجل 14 هدفا في دور المجموعات، مع هدافه القوي الذي دخل التاريخ أمام آرسنال. - عادة مواجهات الفريقين تنتهي بسيطرة بايرن أو بتعادلات عديدة، مما يجعل النتيجة متوازنة (تعادل مفتوح) مثل 2-2 خيار منطقي ومثير — خصوصا إن اعتمد آرسنال على سرعة جناحي الهجوم مثل بوكايو ساكا. تصريحات كومباني تمنى فنسنت كومباني المدير الفني لباير…",

The draft will be available the next time they enter the status creation screen. An animated “2026” sticker with customizable colors is also in development for use in statuses. WhatsApp has been working on adding more creative tools to the status feature, which is great. However, creating a status often becomes a time-consuming process, and it’s pretty common to get interrupted when you’re halfway through. Unfortunately, if you exit the status-creation screen, you will lose your progress and have to start over. WhatsApp v2.25.36.6 includes code for allowing users to save their status as a draft, similar to Instagram, helping fix one of the biggest annoyances in the process.

Qualcomm has compared the new processor to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, saying it’s a follow-up to 2024’s flagship SoC. OnePlus is expected to launch the first Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 phone before the end of the year. Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 a couple of months ago, but it also gave us a sneak peek at the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. It’s taken a while, but the company has finally launched this non-Elite chipset. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, which is built on TSMC’s 3nm manufacturing process, is positioned as the less impressive but still “premium” companion of the 8 Elite Gen 5. What’s particularly interesting is that Qualcomm is comparing the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 rather than the Snapdragon 8 Elite or Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 .",

Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images.

Three years later, the spacecraft detected a signal from the area to the right of the ice cap that scientists interpreted as an underground lake. ESA/DLR/FU Berlin, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO Results from an enhanced radar technique have demonstrated improvement to sub-surface observations of Mars. &nbsp; NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has revisited and raised new questions about a mysterious feature buried beneath thousands of feet of ice at the Red Planet’s south pole. In a recent study, researchers conclude from data obtained using an innovative radar technique that an area on Mars suspected of being an underground lake is more likely to be a layer of rock and dust.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2018 discovery of the suspected lake set off a flurry of scientific activity, as water is closely linked with life in the solar system. While the latest findings indicate this feature is not a lake below the Martian surface, it does suggest that the same radar technique could be used to check for subsurface reso…",

In other words, developers are shipping their game emulators disguised as other apps. Why would they do that? Well, it’s all about maximizing performance. The theory is simple: most smartphones optimize for specific use cases, often sacrificing peak performance for many apps to reduce temperatures and prolong battery life. Your web browser doesn’t need to run your chip at full tilt, after all. However, some devices game the system by unlocking maximum performance for listed applications, sometimes for specific games, and occasionally to improve their benchmark results. By “spoofing” one app to appear as another, a developer can trick the system into unlocking maximum performance that might not have been otherwise available. This is pretty handy if you’re trying to emulate something extremely demanding.",

In other words, the device can turn your wall into a makeshift writing surface. It’s an odd combo that is definitely niche, yet potentially useful for your next game night. For now, the device has only launched in China, but it introduces a unique angle to the budget projector space. The device itself is lightweight and unobtrusive, with an adjustable stand that tilts the unit up to 160 degrees, meaning you can project onto a ceiling. For specs, Honor lists 1080p resolution and 280 CVIA lumens of brightness. Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, HDMI 2.0, USB, and a headphone jack. It also features a built-in 5W speaker.",

It’s a massive 32:9 curved DQHD panel that essentially gives you the screen real estate of two 27-inch QHD monitors stitched together without bezels getting in the way.

Google Support claims the issue is fixed, but users continue to complain that the EIS bug persists. As a workaround, you can temporarily fix the stutter by disabling “Video stabilization” in the Pixel Camera settings. We’ve previously covered the Pixel 10 Pro’s jerky zoom videos and how users had to settle for workarounds to get usable video recordings despite paying over $1,000 for a top-tier flagship. The issue has affected users for months, and while customer support has claimed to some users that the problem has been “fixed,” users claim that it still persists. So we want to ask you: Are you still facing issues when recording video with the Pixel 10 Pro’s telephoto zoom? Reddit user No_Particular7571 had previously spotted that their new Pixel 10 Pro shot very jerky video through its telephoto camera, particularly when panning or moving. However, the stuttering completely disappears when you turn off EIS in the Pixel Camera app, indicating there is a bug in Google’s EIS implementation that conflicts with the phone’s OIS.",

Although details are unclear, this could be the first hike since July 2024 for the region. In other regions, Spotify has indirectly raised prices by rejigging its Premium tiers. After years of teasing and waiting, Spotify finally rolled out Lossless audio a few months ago, allowing Premium subscribers to stream tracks in up to 24-bit/44.1 kHz FLAC quality . The Lossless rollout was long expected to come along with a Premium price hike, but Spotify managed to roll out the better audio quality at the same price. That might not remain the case for long, as it seems that a price hike is on the cards for Spotify Premium. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Deals cover everything from the compact Flex and Pop models to the Lifestudio Grand, for a mix of price points and features. For anyone who’s been burned by the anemic speakers on most portable projectors, Epson is rolling into Black Friday with a batch of genuinely compelling discounts on the first smart streaming projectors in the world to feature Sound by Bose. All Lifestudio models also run Google TV , giving users a full suite of streaming apps, including Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, YouTube, and more, right out of the box. Even at full price, the Lifestudio series is worth a second look, but this week’s savings make it even easier to justify adding one to your cart. The Lifestudio Flex Plus sees one of the strongest markdowns, dropping to $849.99 from $999.99. It’s the most feature-rich of the smaller models, offering 4K PRO-UHD, 1,000 lumens for brighter environments, and Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) for gaming. You still get the same…",
