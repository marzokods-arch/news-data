We're committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout.\" The \" consultation process \" is a requirement of UK law (Splash Damage is a UK-based studio) that takes place prior to layoffs: It grants employees the right to know why they're being laid off, and to explore other possible alternatives.

And that's a difference that's not likely to change, for one simple reason: Epic boss Tim Sweeney thinks AI disclosures are a waste of time. \"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation,\" Sweeney wrote on X (via GamesRadar), agreeing with a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. \"It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.\" (Image credit: Tim Sweeney (Twitter)) This isn't the first time Sweeney has expressed support for generative AI: Earlier this month, for instance, he waded into the debate over Arc Raiders' use of AI-generated voices with a fantasy about games with \"infinite, context-sensitive, personality-reflecting dialog based on and tuned by human voice actors .\" And he's prob…",

It convinced me that Paralives is going to avoid the biggest flaw in Inzoi's early access: a lifeless Live Mode. The whole 45 minutes of new gameplay takes place with a single playable \"para\" in his small flat and the shopping square below it.

Reactions have been mixed on how the developers are simplifying the many classes of WoW to work without needing mods, or addons, to tell you what to do. Game director Ion Hazzikostas made his case for why these changes needed to happen now and promised to be listening carefully to players as the beta continues. Everything else seems to be going pretty smoothly—well, except the fish that ate everyone's frame rate. Every day I see people coming up with new and clever ways to make skylights and libraries with player housing.

Mr. House 🎰 Odds: 1/1 (Image credit: Prime Video) We know for sure Mr. House is in Fallout Season 2—he's shown in the teaser as the pre-war Mr. House, played by Justin Theroux, and in the trailer as the post-war Mr. House, a digital face on a TV screen.

We're in a memory shortage right now, and this applies to both DRAM memory used for RAM and NAND memory used for SSDs, and it will likely also affect GPUs, too. This shortage means there's more demand than supply, which causes prices to rise. We're already seeing RAM prices skyrocket, and prices for SSDs and even GPUs could follow suit before long. We're keeping track of the latest changes to RAM prices here. The cause is mostly the newly booming AI industry, as AI servers require a lot of memory, both in terms of long-term storage and short-term system memory.

I'd never equip them until my stash was full and I needed to free up space, and even then, I'd just slap them on whatever gun would accept them, all willy-nilly. It was a means to an end, so to speak, that end being room for more junk, of course. That's not to say I couldn't feel the difference between a naked gun and a decked-out one; I just didn't put much thought into it. Needless to say, it wasn't optimal, in part because I'd entirely underestimated attachments in favour of trying to accumulate a stockpile of the best guns . After watching ModernNik's impressively comprehensive attachment breakdown, I won't be making those same mistakes again. They tested every type of attachment, and even though some of the gains may look small—like a 0.16ms recoil recovery boost from a common stock—it all adds up. By far my biggest takeaway is that the 'quality sweet-spot', for lack of a better term, is often green, uncommon attachments.

Vendetta, also known as La Lupa, is one of the most distinctive heroes we've seen in Overwatch, and that's primarily because she's the first true melee character. \"But what about Doomfist or Brigitte?\", I hear you say. While these two are technically melee, they're not really when you think about it. Vendetta is almost entirely a sword-slinging brawler with a primary attack that can combo, and that's what makes her different. So when can you play her? Overwatch 2 Vendetta hero trial release time Vendetta's hero trial begins on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, at 11 am PT / 2 pm EST / 7 pm GMT to Monday, December 1 , at the same times, which coincides with the usual update time for the game.

On the bulbous screen of my monitor, I could see some supplies that had gone unpilfered. I sent Hicks—yes, Xenopurge wears its love of Aliens proudly—inside the small room to snatch it, while Morse provided cover, tapping away at my hotkeys to swiftly give them their orders. But the next xeno wave was coming. I'd destroyed the hive, but there were still a couple of locations where aliens from outside could get in. I needed to get my brave lads outta there. I panicked. I fired off the extract command, overriding their programmed logic so that they'd head straight home without getting distracted. Unless an alien slammed into them. Morse got to the door outside the extraction point. Then the red dot appeared. Suddenly it launched itself at Morse—just a subtle movement and change in speed, but somehow still so evocative.

Requiem is a new continuation of the mainline story, meaning you don't need any prior knowledge of Resi to make sense of the unfolding narrative.

But some prior knowledge will help sniff out easter eggs and get a good grasp of how the story will likely unfold. (Image credit: Capcom) To this end, two Resi games will be the most helpful to play. Resident Evil 7 is the first that comes to mind, as this was also directed by Nakanishi and follows a similar structure of introducing a new protagonist who is unfamiliar with combat to the world of Resident Evil. Then there's Resident Evil 2. Nakanishi has explained how Requiem will fall closer to RE2 as opposed to Resident Evil 4 .

It's Mature 17+, in case you were wondering. This would suggest that DS2 is due for a release on god's own platform pretty sharpish, which might come as some surprise. It certainly surprised me. After all, the PS5 version of that game only released in June this year, and I still remember writing news stories about ex-PS boss Jim Ryan declaring that PC players would be waiting \" two or three years \" for the platform's exclusives to make the migration. But it wouldn't be so strange for DS2 to jump across so soon after its console launch. Death Stranding 1 , after all, came to PC in July 2020 after its initial PS4 release in November 2019, and it even came with glitzy add-ons, like a photo mode and some crossover stuff.

But if you're looking to earn all the unique Trials rewards, you're going to need to step up to the plate and give it a shot. Below, I'll go over all the Trials challenges this week and the best way to complete them for a high score. Arc Raiders Trials this week (Image credit: Embark) Right off the bat, it's important to understand how scoring works. Firstly, only your personal best score during a single run for each challenge contributes to your overall ranking, so you need to be prepared. Secondly, you can earn double Trial Score points when map conditions are active , such as Night Raid, Electromagnetic Storm, and Hidden Bunker, so you're always best off attempting the challenges on these runs.

According to the Geekbench entry , we're talking 2,849 single-core points and 15,434 multi-core points. Arguably, it's the single-core result that's most interesting as it theoretically allows for a direct comparison between different generations of Intel Performance cores. The multi-core comparison is complicated by the vagaries of difference Performance, Efficient and Low Power Efficient core configurations, albeit the total result is, ultimately, the total result. The specific Panther Lake model appearing in the Geekbench results is the Core Ultra 9 386H, a mobile CPU as all Panther Lake chips will be at launch.

    "body": "When Battlefield 6 launched a month and a half ago, one of its most anticipated features basically didn't work. The Portal server browser was a dumpster fire at first, hosting dozens upon dozens of lazy XP farms that clogged up EA's servers so bad you couldn't even start your own friend lobby. Then, DICE nerfed XP farms into the ground. Folks complained, some who apparently only bought BF6 to shoot at bots demanded refunds, and many XP farming servers were taken offline. Now weeks later, I decided to check in on the BF6's Portal tab, hoping to find folks using Portal the way I hoped they would from the start: creating neat custom games and hosting specialized servers. I'm pleased to report both are happening, but not in huge amounts. First, the good news: Legitimately fun custom games are starting to pop up, several of which resemble the sort of goofy stuff you'd find perusing the custom lobbies of Halo or Garry's Mod. The most popular one of the moment is Chaos Climb by Forstorare (Portal code: zx45f) . Instead of describing it, I'd rather show you what it's all about: To me, this is videogames. What I dig about Chaos Climb is how it flexes the one big thing that Portal has that …",

Instead, you get to it through Battlefield Redsec , the battle royale mode, which is always free to play. But during the trial period, you'll also have access to three playlists, including a \"casual multiplayer experience,\" across three maps: Siege of Cairo, Eastwood, and Blackwell Fields.\" In a nice nod to newcomers, EA also provided a handy breakdown of each game mode available in the trial, as well as some tips on how to play them effectively .

It might be just what you need, too—especially now that Reforged has its own private multiplayer servers, the headline feature of its recent 2.0 update . Even more ambitiously than the popular Seamless Co-op mod (which is also fully supported here), Reforged bypasses the original game's anti-cheat systems while retaining bloodstains, phantoms, summons and invasions. Helpful, as there are more than 1,200 collectible stat-boosting rune fragments hidden throughout the entire game like Crackdown's irresistible agility orbs, many of which you'd never find without other kindly players placing glowing, tongue-in-cheek hints.

The answer is no: Last Epoch's expansion will be free to anyone who already owns the base game, and it will be packed in for anyone who buys the game after it's out. Last month, EHG founder Judd Cobler said the studio would \"maybe\" have to charge something for the expansion, as the game's first three seasons haven't been profitable. But now it looks like EHG will hold to the promise it made when it ran a Kickstarter for the game in 2018. There's a small catch here though: Alongside the expansion a new \"Paradox class\" will be released and it will have a price that won't be revealed until later. In the announcement post on Reddit, Cobler describes it as a \"fully alternate playable class built on systems that work differently from anything else in the game.\" T…",

Players seemed to enjoy the combination of cozy shop simulator and dungeon crawling roguelite, inspired by the Rogue Legacies and Stardew Valleys of the time. Some grumbled about a lack of depth and incentive to keep returning to the dungeon again and again, and seven years later developer Digital Sun is ready to show us what it’s learned from those criticisms. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is now available in early access on Steam. I spent several hours with it over the past week, and it already feels like a more focused and refined version of the original. The premise remains unchanged: you play as Will, a shopkeep-slash-dungeoneer who is looking to turn his spoils into cold hard cash. The core loop involves diving into randomized dungeons, fighting the monsters there, filling your backpack with loot, selling it for a tidy profit, and doing it all again. Inventory management itself is a puzzle, as items interact with each other in your backpack, forcing you to think carefully about how you use the limited space. In essence, it’s three games in one, each section complete with its own rules. Whil…",

Naomi Alderman is a published author of science fiction novels. And for years she's also been the lead writer for a gamified fitness app called Zombies, Run! It encourages players to get on the move by listening to episodic post-apocalyptic stories, interval training while actively 'running from zombies,' and supplies rewards from workout sessions to upgrade their survival base. Alderman co-created the app and wrote its years' worth of voice-acted, episodic stories that have amassed over 10 million users since 2012.

That Skyrim mod was down to game developer and modder Trainwiz (and friends), who notes in his Bluesky bio that \"Mattel is out to kill me.\" This is because toy giant Mattel owns the rights to the Thomas the Tank Engine characters, and doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humour about Thomas mods. Thus, we arrive at a new frontier for Thomas-based heroics. Trainwiz has popped up with a new mod for Morrowind that \"replaces cliff racers with Thomas the Tank Engine.\" Cliff racers are flying creatures that appear all around the Vvardenfell region of Morrowind, and occasionally swarm the player.

The description on the How to Fish Steam listing doesn't do it justice: \"You and your friends are out drinking and boating. You crash into a small island where you have to fish using everything from fishing rods to assault rifles,\" it explains. \"Sell your catch, earn money, buy better fishing gear, and defeat boss fishes to unlock new islands and finally make it back home.\" We've been living in a post- Ridiculous Fishing world of absurdist angling for years.
