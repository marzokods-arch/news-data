Cut That Wire fits right into the booming \"friend slop\" genre alongside REPO, Peak, Content Warning, and the like⁠—creative, but relatively low-intensity and progression-averse games that can be an excuse to just hang out with your friends. Players are either \"victims\" or the imposter, all trapped in a room together and strapped to ticking time bombs. One victim is the engineer, who is able to see a single safe wire on each bomb. Naturally, you don't know who's who. So, that \"engineer\" could actually be the imposter trying to get you to cut the wrong wire. Spotting the imposter and correctly diffusing each player's bomb involves playing mini games, where you have to either outsmart your friends or bluff your way to victory. The imposter can try to lead the other players astray to get them to cut the wrong wire on their bombs, or they can just drag things out long enough to run dow…",

These are the premises of the company who build audiograph players: the rudimentary recording devices which capture the voices spoken into them, and offer scratchy, echoey playback via punchcards. All over the city, audiographs hold the private thoughts of lords and admirals, the final words of gangsters and royal caretakers. The inner life that elevates NPCs to characters who haunt their levels long after they're ragdolled. The name above the door of that business? AudioLog. It's only fitting, since the inventor of the audiolog was a writer on both Dishonored and its 2016 sequel. During the development of System Shock, Austin Grossman had helped figure out the fundamentals of the genre we now call the immersive sim.

It expanded upon SnowRunner's logistics simulation with systems like convoy automation and an emphasis on constructing road networks (hence the name). But these bigger features came at the cost of a more simplistic driving model, leaving players who preferred the stern navigational challenge of SnowRunner put out. Now, though, Saber has released an update to RoadCraft that folds some of that driving complexity back in. Or at least, it gives players the option to reinstate it themselves if they so choose. The update adds a \"hard mode\" to RoadCraft in the form of several difficulty modifiers, each of which can be toggled on or off depending on how granular you want the experience to be. For driving fans, the key additions are limited fuel and \"realistic\" gearboxes—the latter of which basically means that RoadCraft now supports manual gear-shifting. Frankly, it's wild that RoadCraft launched without this functionality. Fuel management and manual driving are standard features in most dedicated driving sims, let alone a game born from the legacy of SnowRunner…",

July brought an improved mission system and more realistic erosion, while August saw the return of hardcore mode in tougher, meaner form. September's update is by far the smallest for a while. But there is one adjustment that has potentially game-altering ramifications, and it all has to do with the noise that guns make. Basically, Facepunch has altered how sound propagation for firearms works, so gunshots can be heard at significantly longer distances than before. Implementing this was more complicated than you might expect, as Facepunch explains in a Steam post : \"Networking range in Rust is made up of grids,\" the developer explains. \"These grids are a fixed size and can be adjusted by server owners, they are sometimes reduced on high-populated community servers to lower network overhead. When these grids are reduced, it also reduces things like: gun audio. This makes the world feel incredibly small and closed off.\" But Facepunch now says Rust can \"run gunshots at different distances to the network range\" though…",

It's Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone, which may lack the cool moments where movie Viggo Mortenson transforms into polygon Viggo Mortenson and then you get to slice up some ringwraiths, but is otherwise very much in the same mold.

How many Dragon Age games would you say there are? Only four, right? Origins, its sequel, Inquisition and last year's Veilguard. Not many, for a beloved franchise spanning a decade and a half at a major publisher. But then the BioWare team behind the series was often characterised as a pirate ship by colleagues: sailing haphazardly between projects and often drifting off course as it found its way to its next hit. Certainly, there was never a straightforward follow-up that built directly on the success of Origins. BioWare's pirates were routinely tossed about on the rough seas of EA's whims, following mandates for tight budgets or new engines or live service features. Those internal skirmishes added years to the development of mainline Dragon Age games, and we got fewer of them as a consequence. It's hard not to talk ab…",

Whether you're doing quests for them, joining them, fighting them, or grinding reputation to get that one rare armour set you can't live without, factions are often key to your experience with a game. What would Skyrim be without inexplicably becoming the head of four different guilds? What would you do in Destiny if you didn't have a bunch of conveniently compartmentalised aliens to go shoot at? Would it even be possible to enjoy XCOM without a global coalition judging your performance after every mission? (Image credit: Bethesda) So, we've established that factions are important.

Now though, veteran publisher MicroProse has just released Neyyah . That may read like onomatopoeia for the noise Minecraft villagers make, but it is in fact a first-person 3D point 'n' click puzzler, one that doesn't so much wear its Myst inspirations on its sleeve as have them tattooed all over its body. Created over seven years by solo developer Adam Gwynaire, Neyyah transports players to not one but several remote islands dotted with strange plant life and mysterious structures. Like Myst, it's a first-person point and click adventure that involves reactivating arcane machinery by solving puzzles that interconnect in obscure ways. There's a trailer for the game below. The 3D environments certainly look the part, though I'm less sold on the FMV cutscenes used to tell the story, which have a (somewhat endearing, in all fairness) am-dram quality about them.

According to Paradox, Shadows of the Shroud offers a \"complete overhaul\" of Stellaris' Psionic Ascension path. Through this, your civilization taps its telepathic potential to commune with an extra-universal realm known as the Shroud, potentially forming a covenant with one of the cosmic divine beings—known as \"patrons\"—residing within. Shadows of the Shroud delineates this process into three key stages: preparing to pierce the veil, communing with the Patrons, then choosing one to ally with and reaping the rewards/suffering the consequences. As part of this, the DLC adds a new \"Shroud Panel\", helping visualise how attuned you are to the Shroud and specific patrons within it. This should make it easier to see precisely what path you're on, and the rewards (and risks) your chosen direction leads to.

While I generally approved of Tempest Rising's balance between tension and fun, my reaction times aren't what they used to be during C&C's heyday, and having a little more time to think wouldn't have gone amiss in some of its scenarios. Fortunately, this will no longer be a problem as of next week. Tempest Rising's next update will bring several of the community's most hotly requested features.

Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio said a few years ago that he really did not want to call it Prey , and it turns out he was not alone on that: Former Bethesda marketing and communications boss Pete Hines said in an interview with Dbltap that he was dead-set against it too. \"I definitely pissed some people off internally over that because I fought so hard against using that name,\" Hines said. \"I'm the head of the spear, but I had a lot of people across my team—brand, PR and community—and we feel like we're burdening it with a name where we spend more time explaining why it's called Prey than we do talking about the game.\" The reason for all that time spent explaining, as previously noted, is that the whole thing was so odd. Prey—the original—was developed by Human Head Studios and released in 2006, and it was quite good. A sequel was planned, although it was more of a spinoff, following the adventures of a completely different character in a completely different setting: A great ci…",

Like a lot of things in the game, you're not explicitly told how to complete the quest. And if you don't figure it out, you'll have no way out of the area. This particular quest can be frustrating because there's a trick to it that you might only stumble upon by accident. The Seamstress isn't all that helpful when she asks you to find bugs that \"produce a marvelous spine, flexible yet strong.\" I don't know about you, but I've already found quite a lot of spine-like things in the game that are flexible and strong. It would've saved me a lot of time if the Seamstress, I don't know, narrowed it down a little. Turns out, there's one particular type of enemy that drops the Spine Cores you need to finish her quest. They're called Hokers and you've probably passed by a few in the area. They're round little guys who spit out spikes when you hit them. There are a bunch of them just to the right of the Seamstress' hut. All you have to do is slash them once, wait for them to shoot their spines out, and then hit each spine to pick them up as Spine Cores. …",

There are bugs in it and you can fight them. After spending so much time experiencing the wait for Silksong as a shared fever dream, it only felt right for those of us playing it to pool our initial reactions in a collected package: Does it meet the expectations of our Hollow Knight diehards? What does it do for those of us who didn't play the original? How does it feel to play something that you were never entirely sure existed? Are the bugs cool? Silksong, after six years, is here.

When Musk rails against 'the establishment', it's only when it threatens his vast fortune, his ability to indulge in hate speech, or when he's promoting conspiracies. Indeed, he posted multiple tweets during the Covid-19 lockdowns where he drew connections between essential measures to protect the vulnerable and the plot of Deux Ex, where a man-made pandemic is deployed by the world's richest man to advance a political power play. Unsurprisingly, Austin Grossman, who wrote Deus Ex alongside Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, is not a fan of Musk's take on the classic cyberpunk immersive sim. Deus Ex—and Dishonored, which Grossman also wrote—is a game very much interested in the powerful, and the tools they use to control people.

This isn't a pair of headphones to wear on the bus or chat over Discord. They don't even have a microphone. No, the LCD-S20 is for sitting back and engrossing yourself in your favourite game or album and enjoying the tonal brilliance of planar magnetic drivers. Marketed at professional musicians and producers, the LCD-S20 are a little out of our usual comfort zone for PC gaming apparel. However, what makes them great for recording a track in a studio also has a benefit for PC gaming. Namely, planar magnetic drivers with SLAM technology and superb sound isolation. The LCD-S20 look a lot like the Audeze Maxwell . That's a pair of headphones that we rate very highly, with multiple members of the PCG hardware team using them as their daily driver, and I'll get back to comparisons with these later in the review. The LCD-S20 shares the same floating band design with three levels of adjustment, designed to keep all 550 grams of these mostly metal headphones off any one place on your head. It works pretty w…",

I picked up the 2017 game pretty cheap, for reasons I'm not quite sure of—I've never really played or enjoyed sports games, I don't care for golf, and I'd never even heard of the series prior to this purchase. Maybe it was the promise of anime models that looked like they'd been ripped out of a 2000s online rhythm game or sheer summer boredom, but I'm glad my silly little brain made that decision. Everybody's Golf is an excellent game, and I loved the 2017 version's open courses that I could drive a cart around with my own wee custom character. Also, you know, the actual golfing part was surprisingly good with tight physics and a steep but fairly intuitive learning curve. (Image credit: Bandai Namco) It's why I was especially excited to discover that the series was going to be making its PC debut with Everybody's Golf Hot Shots. It's exclusively been a PlayStation thing since the first game released in 1997—except for the one game that made its way to mobile in Japan. What I wasn't so excited about was the fact Clap Hanz is no longer at the helm. Hot Shots instead has been tackled by…",

Whether you remember it or not, Pete Hines—former senior vice president of global marketing and communications at Bethesda—certainly does. In a chat with Dbltap , Hines recalled the whole episode, which he says he only learnt about when his own collector's edition hit his doorstep, like an old army guy remembering a particularly harrowing battle. \"My first reaction was, 'When the fuck did we add a canvas bag to this collector's edition?'

MGS Delta: Snake Eater launched on August 28, though was available a couple of days earlier for those who shelled out for the digital deluxe edition. PCG's review concluded that \"Delta answers the question it most needed to answer: Can Konami still make a great Metal Gear game? By most metrics I think this has aced it.\" The sales might be impressive but the launch hasn't gone completely to plan, with the game suffering some significant performance issues, particularly with frame drops. Konami has acknowledged the issues and says it's \"currently investigating the causes and working on a patch to resolve these problems\", but as yet there's no ETA.

Once I'd got my grubby little mitts around the Creative Stage Pro sizeable box, and subsequently torn into its cardboard prison with a scavenger's frenzy, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy the setup process was. Yes, this is a beefy sound device that requires a lot of wires plus its own power plug, but you're only setting up one soundbar alongside one subwoofer, and it all comes with straightforward, easy to understand instructions in the box. Also inside the box is a remote, though this runs off of 2x AAA batteries that are very much not included. The soundbar features a few rubberised control buttons too, so it's not the end of the world if pick…",

This strange character living in Mosshome needs three of the berries to complete her concoction, and you'll get a nice reward at the end if you take on the Berry Picking wish. Chances are, if you like to explore, you've already found one or two of the Mossberries when you were making your way up to the top of the Moss Grotto. Still, that last Mossberry may be evading you, so here's where to find them all in the starting area. All Silksong Mossberry locations for the Moss Druid There are four potential Mossberries to find in the lower areas of Pharloom, but you'll only need three for the Moss Druid and the Berry Picking quest. If you find the additional berry (or any others), you can hand them in after the quest is complete for a whopping 80 Rosaries .

Last week I was: Getting back into Deadlock, because I just really hate having free time. One thing I've seen repeated often in Borderlands 4's interviews is the insistence that yes, we've learned our lesson with Borderlands 3, and we're not going to give you a headache this time . We've got character motivations, stakes, and jokes not rooted in years-old memes! Which is fair enough. Borderlands 3's story ( which, warning, I will be spoiling ) was so atrocious it nearly spoiled what I otherwise found to be a great little game. I massively enjoyed zipping around as Zane with my movement speed build, and the moment-to-moment blasting was as consistent as ever. And then the story would happen and I'd start itching desperately to be shooting something again. It wasn't just the jokes, either. Borderlands 3 tripped over itself when it came to its serious moments, too. Maya's death, its insistence that Ava was the chosen one, Lilith throwing herself into a moon for some reason, any time the Calypso twins, who could've been 1,000% more interesting, were on screen—it wa…",

    "body": "In recent years, software giant Microsoft has been releasing the source code for some of its oldest operating systems under MIT open-source licenses. Examples include MS-DOS and GW-BASIC , and now another blast from the past has been added to the collection. Somewhat surprisingly, though, this one is really old and just so happens to be a version of its first-ever software product. Specifically, it's a port of BASIC, the OS that founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed for use on the Intel 8080-powered Altair 8800 . As explained in a Microsoft blog , the version that's just been released on GitHub was created for computers using MOS Technology 6502 processors (via The Register ). The Intel 8080 and MOS 6502 were both 8-bit CPUs, launched in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Although the latter was less capable than the former, it was considerably cheaper, which is why Acorn Computers, Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and many others bought it in droves to power their computers and consoles. Such was the popularity of the 6502 that Gates and Ric Weiland wrote a port of BASIC specifically for that processor, which Commodore paid a flat license fee to use on its PET computer (then i…",
