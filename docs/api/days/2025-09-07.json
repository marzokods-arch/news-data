    "body": "One of System Shock 2 's more unusual quirks is how it supports four player co-op. This was extremely rare in PC gaming in general at the tail end of the nineties, and it makes System Shock 2 unique among the classic immersive sims. With its 25 th anniversary remaster, Nightdive Studios wanted to ensure this co-op functionality was brought up to date with the rest of System Shock 2. Yet according to producer Daniel Grayshon, getting it to work was a nightmare worthy of SHODAN herself. Speaking on the Nightdive Studios Deep Dive podcast, Grayshon explains the sticking point was how System Shock 2 uses an old-fashioned direct IP connection based on DirectPlay. \"[This] was a very old Windows built-in functionality to do some redirecting somewhere and ultimately try to end up at the destination,\" he says. Aside from DirectPlay being insecure by modern standards, Nightdive also wanted the remaster to support crossplay between PS5, Xbox, Switch and so forth. \"We need to strip this out, completely strip this out. We can't have direct connections anymore because the consoles will not allow that at all,\" Grayshon explains. \"We need to construct some kind of lobby system, and we need to tap…",

Monster and Monster's hybrid trucking sim dedicates itself to synthesising grand journeys across the cosmos with the specific vehicle handling and road networks of Euro Truck Simulator 2 . The combination was relatively well received by players when Star Trucker launched in 2024, earning itself a \"Mostly Positive\" rating on Steam out of just under 3,000 reviews. Now Monster and Monster is celebrating a whole year of interplanetary logistics, with the double delivery of an anniversary update and a big discount. Said anniversary update brings a container's worth of new features to Star Trucker, foremost among which is peripheral support. Henceforth, you can increase the realism of driving a rocket-propelled truck along roads strung through space by plugging in the joystick/steering wheel/custom Millennium Falcon dashboard of your choice. While the update is designed to accommodate the broadest range of peripherals possible, in a dev blog Monster and Monster points out that it is a small team and therefore \"it's …",

It expanded upon SnowRunner's logistics simulation with systems like convoy automation and an emphasis on constructing road networks (hence the name). But these bigger features came at the cost of a more simplistic driving model, leaving players who preferred the stern navigational challenge of SnowRunner put out. Now, though, Saber has released an update to RoadCraft that folds some of that driving complexity back in. Or at least, it gives players the option to reinstate it themselves if they so choose. The update adds a \"hard mode\" to RoadCraft in the form of several difficulty modifiers, each of which can be toggled on or off depending on how granular you want the experience to be. For driving fans, the key additions are limited fuel and \"realistic\" gearboxes—the latter of which basically means that RoadCraft now supports manual gear-shifting. Frankly, it's wild that RoadCraft launched without this functionality. Fuel management and manual driving are standard features in most dedicated driving sims, let alone a game born from the legacy of SnowRunner…",

    "body": "Rust has entered a quieter period as it stocks the hold for its naval update due in a couple of months. But Facepunch Studios still continues to add bits here and there. July brought an improved mission system and more realistic erosion, while August saw the return of hardcore mode in tougher, meaner form. September's update is by far the smallest for a while. But there is one adjustment that has potentially game-altering ramifications, and it all has to do with the noise that guns make. Basically, Facepunch has altered how sound propagation for firearms works, so gunshots can be heard at significantly longer distances than before. Implementing this was more complicated than you might expect, as Facepunch explains in a Steam post : \"Networking range in Rust is made up of grids,\" the developer explains. \"These grids are a fixed size and can be adjusted by server owners, they are sometimes reduced on high-populated community servers to lower network overhead. When these grids are reduced, it also reduces things like: gun audio. This makes the world feel incredibly small and closed off.\" But Facepunch now says Rust can \"run gunshots at different distances to the network range\" though…",

It's not likely we'll ever see a PC port of The Two Towers, but fortunately its creator, Stormfront Studios, made a similar hack-and-slash shortly after and that is on PC, with a rerelease by SNEG showing up on Steam . It's Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone, which may lack the cool moments where movie Viggo Mortenson transforms into polygon Viggo Mortenson and then you get to slice up some ringwraiths, but is otherwise very much in the same mold.

Paradox noted that PlayStation customers will be able to place a new preorder for the game after it finally announces those adjustments on September 17th. \"Anyone who pre-ordered the Premium Edition through the PlayStation Store will be contacted and refunded starting Monday, September 8th,\" a Paradox representative wrote on the VTMB subreddit . \"You will be able to pre-order your Premium Edition copy again later, before the release on October 21st.

The show will retell the story of the first game in the series, which was originally released in 2015 by Don't Nod. It's too early for any casting announcements, but we know who will be writing and producing. Leading the series is Charlie Covell, who will be the writer, executive producer, and showrunner. You may already be familiar with Covell's work—they also wrote Netflix's Kaos and The End of the F***ing World⁠—Netflix's censorship, not ours⁠—both of which are dripping in dark comedy. In a statement to Variety, Covell described helming the Life is Strange show as \"a huge honor,\" saying, \"I am a massive fan of the game, and I’m thrilled to be working with the incredible teams at Square Enix, Story Kitchen and LuckyChap. I can’t wait to share Max and Chloe’s story with fellow players and new audiences alike.\" Along with Covell, the series will also be executive produced by the Story Kitchen team, which is also working on adaptations of Tomb Raider , Split Fiction, and It Takes Two, all at Amazon.

How many Dragon Age games would you say there are? Only four, right? Origins, its sequel, Inquisition and last year's Veilguard. Not many, for a beloved franchise spanning a decade and a half at a major publisher. But then the BioWare team behind the series was often characterised as a pirate ship by colleagues: sailing haphazardly between projects and often drifting off course as it found its way to its next hit. Certainly, there was never a straightforward follow-up that built directly on the success of Origins. BioWare's pirates were routinely tossed about on the rough seas of EA's whims, following mandates for tight budgets or new engines or live service features. Those internal skirmishes added years to the development of mainline Dragon Age games, and we got fewer of them as a consequence. It's hard not to talk ab…",

Whether you're doing quests for them, joining them, fighting them, or grinding reputation to get that one rare armour set you can't live without, factions are often key to your experience with a game. What would Skyrim be without inexplicably becoming the head of four different guilds? What would you do in Destiny if you didn't have a bunch of conveniently compartmentalised aliens to go shoot at? Would it even be possible to enjoy XCOM without a global coalition judging your performance after every mission? (Image credit: Bethesda) So, we've established that factions are important.

Now though, veteran publisher MicroProse has just released Neyyah . That may read like onomatopoeia for the noise Minecraft villagers make, but it is in fact a first-person 3D point 'n' click puzzler, one that doesn't so much wear its Myst inspirations on its sleeve as have them tattooed all over its body. Created over seven years by solo developer Adam Gwynaire, Neyyah transports players to not one but several remote islands dotted with strange plant life and mysterious structures. Like Myst, it's a first-person point and click adventure that involves reactivating arcane machinery by solving puzzles that interconnect in obscure ways. There's a trailer for the game below.

Just four months on from the Biogenesis addon , which built out the 4X's bioengineering pathways, the Shadows of the Shroud DLC will expand the minds of psionic players on September 22. According to Paradox, Shadows of the Shroud offers a \"complete overhaul\" of Stellaris' Psionic Ascension path. Through this, your civilization taps its telepathic potential to commune with an extra-universal realm known as the Shroud, potentially forming a covenant with one of the cosmic divine beings—known as \"patrons\"—residing within. Shadows of the Shroud delineates this process into three key stages: preparing to pierce the veil, communing with the Patrons, then choosing one to ally with and reaping the rewards/suffering the consequences. As part of this, the DLC adds a new \"Shroud Panel\", helping visualise how attuned you are to the Shroud and specific patrons within it. This should make it easier to see precisely what path you're on, and the rewards (and risks) your chosen direction leads to. As your power increases, your psionic aura will spread across the galaxy, influencing …",

While I generally approved of Tempest Rising's balance between tension and fun, my reaction times aren't what they used to be during C&C's heyday, and having a little more time to think wouldn't have gone amiss in some of its scenarios. Fortunately, this will no longer be a problem as of next week. Tempest Rising's next update will bring several of the community's most hotly requested features. Among these is an active pause feature and a game speed adjustment tool designed specifically for the singleplayer campaign, letting you tweak the pace of the action to your liking, or freeze the game entirely while issuing orders to your units. Adjustable singleplayer speed isn't the community's most requested feature, however. That, apparently, is larger-scale multiplayer matches. Currently, Tempest Rising supports 1…",

This particular quest can be frustrating because there's a trick to it that you might only stumble upon by accident. The Seamstress isn't all that helpful when she asks you to find bugs that \"produce a marvelous spine, flexible yet strong.\" I don't know about you, but I've already found quite a lot of spine-like things in the game that are flexible and strong. It would've saved me a lot of time if the Seamstress, I don't know, narrowed it down a little. Turns out, there's one particular type of enemy that drops the Spine Cores you need to finish her quest. They're called Hokers and you've probably passed by a few in the area. They're round little guys who spit out spikes when you hit them. There are a bunch of them just to the right of the Seamstress' hut. All you have to do is slash them once, wait for them to shoot their spines out, and then hit each spine to pick them up as Spine Cores. …",

In the years since, spanning stretches of developer silence and shifting release windows, the Hollow Knight sequel was steadily warped into an inscrutable object of collective fascination. Silksong was less an upcoming game than it was a singularity of attention, continually accreting interest while emitting nothing back. And now it's out. You can play it. There are bugs in it and you can fight them. After spending so much time experiencing the wait for Silksong as a shared fever dream, it only felt right for those of us playing it to pool our initial reactions in a collected package: Does it meet the expectations of our Hollow Knight diehards? What does it do for those of us who didn't play the original? How does it feel to play something that you were never entirely sure existed? Are the bugs cool? Silksong, after six years, is here. Here are our first thoughts. Team Cherry is hitting harder than ever—but maybe it could pull a punch or two?

Mouselook or dual analogue control mods can sometimes make a classic more approachable, but other times it's like you used AI to \"improve\" the Mona Lisa or something. Caput Mortum gets this, and makes the controls one of your primary enemies, elevating a pretty good horror game to a truly memorable one. Caput Mortum's idiosyncratic controls, partly lifted from King's Field, FromSoftware's pre-Dark Souls first-person dungeon crawlers, had me hooting from the start. It's a \"we were still figuring out first-person on gamepad\" sort of deal: You look left and right with the triggers and up and down with the bumpers, swiveling your head like you're dialing in a WW2 anti-aircraft gun.

Musk sees himself as an outsider and heroic figure taking on the status quo, despite being the world's richest man, the owner of X, and a sometimes-ally of Donald Trump. When Musk rails against 'the establishment', it's only when it threatens his vast fortune, his ability to indulge in hate speech, or when he's promoting conspiracies. Indeed, he posted multiple tweets during the Covid-19 lockdowns where he drew connections between essential measures to protect the vulnerable and the plot of Deux Ex, where a man-made pandemic is deployed by the world's richest man to advance a political power play. Unsurprisingly, Austin Grossman, who wrote Deus Ex alongside Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, is not a fan of Musk's take on the classic cyberpunk immersive sim. Deus Ex—and Dishonored, which Grossman also wrote—is a game very much interested in the powerful, and the tools they use to control people. It's also an exploration of the ethics of transhumanism—an industry that Musk himself is extremely invested in. \"That kind of pol…",

Maybe it was the promise of anime models that looked like they'd been ripped out of a 2000s online rhythm game or sheer summer boredom, but I'm glad my silly little brain made that decision. Everybody's Golf is an excellent game, and I loved the 2017 version's open courses that I could drive a cart around with my own wee custom character. Also, you know, the actual golfing part was surprisingly good with tight physics and a steep but fairly intuitive learning curve.

    "body": "Konami has finally returned to the Metal Gear series with its remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and the results have been instantaneous. The publisher has announced that MGS Delta: Snake Eater surpassed a million sales across all platforms (PC, PS5, and Xbox) on its launch day. MGS Delta: Snake Eater launched on August 28, though was available a couple of days earlier for those who shelled out for the digital deluxe edition. PCG's review concluded that \"Delta answers the question it most needed to answer: Can Konami still make a great Metal Gear game? By most metrics I think this has aced it.\" The sales might be impressive but the launch hasn't gone completely to plan, with the game suffering some significant performance issues, particularly with frame drops. Konami has acknowledged the issues and says it's \"currently investigating the causes and working on a patch to resolve these problems\", but as yet there's no ETA. (Image credit: Konami) Nevertheless this shows what we all surely knew anyway: Metal Gear is still big business, even without series impresario Hideo Kojima. Konami seems pretty happy with itself too, saying in a press release that \"this achievement reflect…",

Usually, items like this unlock hidden areas or even give you early access to late-game regions—this is a Metroidvania after all. There are a couple of locations in the starting areas where you can use your key to access something fancy. I'll run through how to locate them and find your way to each.

We're in 'AAAAA' territory, gang; new heights of absurdity are here. That's per Nigel Lowrie, co-founder of Devolver Digital, in a chat with IGN . In a chat about Silksong and the mad scramble of devs to escape the orbit of its release date , Lowrie mentioned that there is, of course, an upcoming release even bigger, more enormous, more Brobdingnagian than Hornet and her needle: GTA 6. \"There are AAA games and then there's AAAA games,\" said Lowrie, \"and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game.\" That's quintuple-A, if they start blurring together at some point for you like they do for me. \"It's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands.\" Silksong might have loomed over other indie games, but GTA 6 hangs over anything you could conceivably call a videogame.
