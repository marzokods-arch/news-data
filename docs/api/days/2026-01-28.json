Android’s release cycle sounds simple on paper, but it’s anything but. Scratch the surface, and you’ll find a maze of previews, betas, and other mysterious builds that often just go over your head. Android releases don’t move in a straight line, from ‘under development’ to ‘released’. Multiple versions of the operating system exist at the same time, at different stages of development, and are meant for completely different audiences. What creates confusion is that all of them are discussed simultaneously on online forums. The confusion spirals further when you add Pixel-exclusive features , leaked experiments, and the constant noise enthusiasts create on social media.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR A new report found dozens of AI “nudify” and face-swap apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Despite policies against sexual nudity, these apps were distributed through the app stores. Many of the apps generated significant revenue from in-app purchases, of which the platforms take as much as a 30% cut. Many of these apps were removed following the report, but several are still available for download. AI is one of the most powerful tools available these days, and you can do so much with it. But, like any tool, it can be used for good or bad . Over the past few weeks, we’ve witnessed social media users using X’s Grok AI chatbot in lewd ways, primarily to create sexualized imagery of women without their consent. As it turns out, it’s not just Grok that has been at the center of this undressing scandal, as both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store allegedly hosted “nudify” apps. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR The Nothing Phone 4a Pro has leaked again, this time through a certification by the EU’s power ratings body. The Phone 4a Pro gets a subtle increment in the battery, but retains the same 50W charging speed. The other big improvement is the water protection rating, now IP65. Unlike the more premium Phone 3, which largely disappointed with its inflated pricing, Nothing’s Phone 3a and the 3a Pro impressed with their high value proposition and features absent from mid-range phones. Naturally, the successors, Nothing Phone 4a and Phone 4a Pro, have big shoes to fill. We expect the series to come with reasonable upgrades without a significant price increase, and a recent leak proves this assumption may be partially true. The Nothing Phone 4a Pro has been on the horizon for several months now. After the Phone 4a and 4a Pro first appeared back in September , some of their specifications were tipped last month alongside hints of a new affordable headphone from the brand. A more recent leak now reveals the charging speed and the slightly increased battery capacity.",

The veteran rocker and environmentalist proves, once more, that he’s rockin’ in the free world by sharing the love with Greenland, an ally which unwittingly finds itself with a massive target on its back, placed there by Donald Trump’s administration. “I’m honored to give a free year’s access to neilyoungarchives.com to all our friends in Greenland,” writes Young on his website . “I hope my music and music films will ease some of the unwarranted stress and threats you are experiencing from our unpopular and hopefully temporary government,” he adds. “It is my sincere wish for you to be able to enjoy all of my music in your beautiful Greenland home, in its highest quality. This is an offer of Peace and Love.” Young continues, “all the music I have made during the last 62 years is yours to hear. You can renew for free as long as you are in Greenland. We do hope other organizations will follow in the spirit of our example.” Just how many of Greenland’s 57,000 residents are fans of Neil Young and his vast catalog is unclear, though the message is plain to see: music and art can help in difficult times.

The bug report contains two screen recordings showing off the system UI and split-screen multitasking. We also get a look at the Chrome browser and Play Store app running on the platform. We’ve known for a while now that Google plans to replace Chrome OS with Aluminium OS , which merges Chrome OS and Android into a single computer-focused platform. Now, it looks like Google has accidentally given the world an early look at this unified platform. 9to5Google spotted a Google bug report on the Chromium Issue Tracker that contains two screen recordings of Aluminium OS running on an HP Elite Dragonfly 13.5 Chromebook. Google has since restricted access to the report, but the outlet still retained the recordings. Check out the one screen recording at the top of the page, and the other below.",

The Commission will issue preliminary findings within three months, along with a draft of the measures it intends to impose on Google to comply with the DMA.

Nova Launcher, the popular Android launcher thought to have shut down in September 2025 , is officially back, but with a twist. The app started receiving regular updates in November ahead of an ownership change this month.

Real-time QR code scanning is a major upgrade, helping users avoid fake login pages and malware-filled sites instantly. Improved social message analysis makes it easier to catch scams that look like normal conversations. Online scams keep getting more advanced and harder to notice. Scammers use tricks like fake QR codes on restaurant tables and urgent messages from hacked social accounts to blend in with daily digital life. McAfee wants to tackle this growing problem with a new update to its Scam Detector service. McAfee just announced big improvements to its Scam Detector tool, like instant QR code scam checks and better protection for social messaging apps. Now, instead of only reacting after a scam happens, the software helps right when you’re about to click, scan, or reply. If you’ve ever paused before clicking a strange link or scanning a code in public, this update is meant for you.",

Brighter blue areas indicate a higher density of dark matter. Researchers used Webb data to find the dark matter — which is invisible — via its gravitational influence on regular matter.

Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) peered at this region for a total of about 255 hours. Dark matter doesn’t emit, reflect, absorb, or even block light, and is therefore not visible to the human eye or traditional telescopes.

This lines up with a leak we saw earlier in the month, but not a more recent rumor from last week. Leaker Evan Blass recently claimed the S26 would launch in six colors. Amid a recent blitz of Galaxy S26 rumors and leaks, we’ve heard about color options a couple of times: first in the context of leaked images of the S26 Ultra’s SIM card tray , then in a second rumor that corroborated the colors from that initial leak while claiming the existence of two more. Today, though, we’ve got a conflicting report that lines up with the SIM card tray leak, but doesn’t mention the other colorways we heard about later. Leaker theonecid posted on Twitter today that the Galaxy S26 series will come in four colors: black, white, Cobalt Violet, and Sky Blue. Those are the same colors seen in images of the Ultra model’s SIM tray posted earlier this month by Ice Universe — but today’s post notably lacks the “silver shadow” and “pink gold” colorways leaker Evan Blass claimed would be available on the S26 Ultra last week.",

Like many of you, I’m old enough to remember when the Nokia 3210 was the phone to have, and Snake was the game everyone played. It was ultra simple and brutally addictive. As far as we’ve come with mobile gaming, it’s hard to match the nostalgia of those halcyon days, especially on a smartwatch . That’s why a recent post on Reddit’s Galaxy Watch community caught our attention. A developer going by JackGrylls shared an early build of a Snake-style game made specifically for Galaxy Watch and Wear OS, aiming to bring back the feel of the old bezel-controlled version they remember from the Tizen days.",

Last year’s Galaxy S25 Ultra features an 8-bit display that uses a software technique to simulate 10-bit color. Samsung Galaxy S26 rumors have been heating up lately. In recent weeks, we’ve seen credible rumors about color options , storage configurations , materials , and more. Today, a new rumor says we should expect a fairly significant display upgrade. Samsung’s 2025 Galaxy S lineup uses display panels with 8-bit color depth, which are capable of reproducing about 16.7 million discrete colors. Prolific leaker Ice Universe tweeted this morning that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will feature a 10-bit panel, drastically increasing the number of colors the phone’s screen can display.",

Astronomers have long sought evidence to explain why&nbsp; comets &nbsp;at the outskirts of our own&nbsp; solar system &nbsp;contain crystalline silicates, since crystals require intense heat to form and these “dirty snowballs” spend most of their time in the ultracold&nbsp;Kuiper Belt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Oort Cloud. Now, looking outside our solar system, Webb has returned the first conclusive evidence that links how those conditions are possible. The telescope clearly showed for the first time that the hot, inner part of the disk of gas and dust surrounding a very young, actively forming star is where crystalline silicates are forged. Webb also revealed a strong outflow that is capable of carrying the crystals to the outer edges of this disk. Compared to our own fully formed, mostly dust-cleared solar system, the crystals would be forming approximately between the Sun and Earth. Re…",

Update: January 27, 2026 (9:47 AM ET): A Google spokesperson has informed Android Authority that it’s unclear what the exact situation is for this specific user. However, YouTube users without Premium can still access playback speeds up to 2x and adjust the speed in 0.05 increments. Meanwhile, Premium users can play videos at speeds up to 4x. The spokesperson adds that the company often runs experiments to specifically highlight premium features to non-subscribers as a way to encourage trying out Premium. It’s possible this user may be seeing a prompt to sign up for Premium in order to use speeds above 2x.",

Without this fix, these devices would slowly break. Once the certificate expired, they’d lose access to Apple’s servers and core features. The update is about functional life support, not new features; devices remain on old iOS 12 and many modern apps won’t work. Supporting a smartphone for more than a decade sounds almost impossible with how quickly new models come out these days, as in the case of Android models . But this week, Apple did just that by releasing a software update for iPhones that were first released more than 10 years ago. Apple has quietly released iOS 12.5.8, a surprise update for legacy hardware that can’t run modern versions of iOS, as spotted by a Reddit user . This includes the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, the original iPad Air, the iPad mini 2 and 3, and even the sixth-generation iPod touch.",

The project has garnered significant attention from a viral Tweet on Monday. The tool is not yet finished, but the goal is similar to other projects like N64: Recompiled. While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday. Although it’s far from being finished, the goal is to statically recompile PS2 games into modern C++. Combined with the right renderer, this code can then be turned into a native PC port with significantly better performance than any traditional emulator can offer.",

We’ve previously spotted Google working on a new UI for Google Wallet , one that better accommodates your favorite passes for quicker access. At the time, we didn’t know exactly what this new UI would look like, whether the favorited passes would be highlighted on the Wallet app’s home screen, or appear directly on the phone’s home screen. Thanks to a recent Google Wallet update, we now have a much better idea of how favoriting passes would work in the new UI.

Around two dozen devices are at risk of going obsolete, but you might be eligible for a partial refund if you bought them recently. However, if your device supports Apple HomeKit or Thread, it is immune to the shutdown. The shutdown date for Belkin’s Wemo smart home app is almost upon us. On January 31, 2026, Wemo’s cloud service will be shuttered, and any devices that run on it will effectively be turned into dumb devices (if they can still function, as with light bulbs). Therefore, Belkin is sending final reminders to owners and telling them they may be eligible for refunds in certain cases. After first announcing Wemo’s shutdown back in July last year, Belkin is sending emails to users again, reminding them to arrange alternatives if needed. In its email to existing users, Belkin also notes that while its Wemo cloud interface is shutting down, devices compatible with Apple’s HomeKit or Thread’s IoT protocol will continue to work through their respective services.",

According to a new Google Workspace update , Google is rolling out smarter suggested meeting times directly inside Google Calendar.

    "body": "Credit: Apple TL;DR Apple has announced a new AirTag with a longer Precision Finding range, improved Bluetooth detection, and a much louder built-in speaker. The updated AirTag also adds Precision Finding support on Apple Watch, making it easier to track items without pulling out your phone. Pricing stays the same as before, starting at $29 for one AirTag or $99 for a four-pack. After last month’s leak pointing to a long-overdue refresh, Apple has officially unveiled a new version of its AirTag tracker. While it has been referred to as the “AirTag 2” in the past, Apple isn’t using that name. This is simply the new AirTag, and it’s focused on a more extended range, easier findability, and tighter integration with Apple’s ecosystem. According to the Apple Newsroom , the updated AirTag offers a significantly improved Precision Finding experience thanks to the company’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip. Apple says you can now locate an AirTag from up to 50% farther away than before, while an upgraded Bluetooth chip also extends the range at which nearby devices can help detect it through the Find My network.",

However, that hasn’t stopped scams from popping up in other parts of the web, prompting AYN to send out a warning message this morning. The company writes that it has received reports of unaffiliated websites selling its products online. These range from overpriced resellers to outright scams, and the company warns that it “cannot guarantee any sort of protection if you purchase from non-AYN sites.” The company also notes that only emails from addresses ending in @ayn.hk are official AYN staff members.",

After my colleague’s thoughts on the topic, we decided to ask you whether there’s a good reason to leave Verizon right now or if it’s worth sticking with it for the time being. We stuck the poll in Andrew Grush’s own back-and-forth article over whether he should finally leave Verizon himself . The move to prepaid made sense on paper, especially after paying off most of the devices on his account. But once Verizon started stacking discounts and even offered a temporary free line, the math wasn’t quite as clear-cut to him anymore. He wasn’t suddenly Verizon’s biggest fan, but the extra incentives slowed his urgency to jump ship.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android 17 is said to be shifting away from flat design toward translucent, blur-heavy visuals. Google could roll out a frosted-glass look across core UI elements, including the volume slider and power menu. Dynamic Color will reportedly tint blurred panels, helping the new transparency effects blend with your wallpaper and theme. Android 17 is still months from its official launch, but it’s clear that Google plans to change how you use your phone. After years of flat, solid colors, the next version — codenamed “Cinnamon Bun” — is said to focus on translucent, blurry backgrounds. We saw the seeds of this change planted last year with the introduction of Material 3 Expressive , which brought subtle blurs to the notification shade and the Quick Settings panel. Google wanted to create a sense of depth so that the user interface felt lightweight rather than like a heavy, opaque wall of color blocking your view.",

In his Galaxy A56 5G review , my colleague Ryan Haines found that the phone’s mediocre performance, lack of wireless charging, and limited camera capabilities hold it back considerably. But above all, one of the A56’s most significant problems is that it’s outdone by the competition.",

The listing corroborates a previous claim that the cheapest Galaxy S26 will now offer 256GB of storage instead of 128GB. This would be a long-overdue move as most of Samsung’s rivals have offered 256GB of base storage for years now. Samsung is one of the few manufacturers still offering flagship Android phones with 128GB of storage, as seen on the base Galaxy S25. However, a new retail leak has revealed some good news for the Galaxy S26. SuomiMobiili reports (h/t: SammyGuru ) that an unnamed Finnish retailer has posted color and storage details for the Samsung Galaxy S26 range . The base Galaxy S26 will apparently be available in 256GB and 512GB flavors.",

With the AI boom, Google wants to make information accessible without any significant effort, and is extending these principles beyond web search. Last month, it extended the same altruistic virtues to Google Drive, where you now see AI overview-style summaries for your folders . With this change, Google’s AI will look through your folders, any directories within them, the files stored in them, and even the contents of those files, so you can find whatever you’re looking for immediately. These “smart” features in Google Drive are available to all paying Gemini subscribers and Workspace users. Google says it saves time and helps you discover files buried under several layers of folders. But I’m deeply unsettled by Google raking through my files — especially without my explicit consent — and the only solution I feel I have now is to stop trusting Google with anything private.",

However, not every reader agreed with me, and some mentioned a name I hadn’t heard (or used) in years: SwiftKey . I was once an avid SwiftKey user, opting for the innovative keyboard early in my Android journey over Google’s simpler default option. The allure of the more efficient and sensibly designed Google alternative eventually drew me away as I upgraded to more polished devices. But, given that we’ve just started a new year, could the reverse be true? Could SwiftKey challenge Gboard on my devices going forward?",
