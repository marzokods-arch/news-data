If you were a goth kid in the '90s, you are going to feel completely at home. Between two preview builds, I've now played about 3 hours of Bloodlines 2, and in terms of its authenticity, I'm sold. From the moonlit streets, to the moody fashion, to the derelict mansions and art deco apartments, it couldn't feel more like a world where sexy-cool vampires would be at home. And there's no shyness about taking the tabletop lore seriously—concepts like the Camarilla and the Masquerade aren't just background, they're core to the story. (Image credit: Paradox Interactive) It can feel a bit like Proper Noun Overload, and there is something inherently stuffy about a lot of the bloodsucker politics. But that's punctured nicely by the two playable characters—Phyre, an ancient vampire awoken from over hundred years of slumber, and Fabien, a disembodied 1940s vampire detective who lives in their head (for slightly tangled reasons).…",

Sanctified by Jet Set Radio, that visual lineage continues in the work of creators like Bomb Rush Cyberfunk developer Team Reptile, which just revealed its next entry in stunt-centric Y2K futurism. It's called Hyperfunk, and Team Reptile says it's \"2 seconds per second of evolved funkstyle.\" Based purely on Steam page description, the developer has achieved a 100% funkstyle increase since Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. I don't know if they do Nobel prizes for that kind of thing, but I think they should consider it. (Image credit: Team Reptile) If you don't find \"evolved funkstyle\" a particularly informative bit of phraseology, let me put it in more digestible terms. Team Reptile says Hyperfunk is \"an extreme trick and graffiti game from a bright future\" where graffiti crews battle \"with style and ideology of how to interpret this new world.\" To do that, they need to go fast. To go fast, they need to do tricks for boostpack energy. More combo, more speed. It's simple science. And judging fro…",

I'd hate to try and do all that on something smaller or with fewer pixels. Of course, you ideally need a beefy graphics card to game at 4K and certainly for today's big releases with spangly ray-traced visuals. But what if you don't have one but still need a big, high-resolution screen for work? Well, you can just run your games at 1080p, but then it'll look all blurry. One solution is the current in-thing in the world of displays: dual-mode monitors. These are natively 4K in resolution but, at the touch of a button, they switch to 1080p. To counter the inherent blurring this normally produces, manufacturers employ a host of clever pixel blending tricks, and our current recommendation for the best 4K dual-mode monitor, the Alienware AW2725QF , does a very good job of it all.

But there's been a surprising U-turn, with Krafton significantly changing its argument. The lawsuit is now in the discovery phase, so Fortis Advisors, which represents the ousted founders, sought discovery to see if Krafton held evidence to back up its claims. \"But despite its obvious relevance, Krafton feigned astonishment during the parties' meet and confers at how it could possibly be part of Phase I,\" Fortis said.

Included in this drop are over 10 million people leaving the PC platform entirely. Consoles, handhelds, and mobile all offer compelling value for the budget-limited gamer.\" It's not all down to people upping and leaving, though: \"A few million entry-level defectors are not actually leaving the PC platform but are migrating to the more expensive hardware tiers of midrange and high-end PC hardware.\" JPR seems to put at least some of this down to the impending ending of support for Windows 10 : \"Never before in the history of the Microsoft Windows operating system has there been a forced hardware migration requirement.

Intel needs a helping hand in a few ways. The company is struggling with a falling share price and recently struck a deal with the US government to buy a share of the business, and getting an in with one of the richest companies on the planet isn't a bad get.

The announcement also broke the news of a $5 billion investment by Nvidia into Intel's common stock, at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. According to sources speaking to The New York Times , the Trump administration approached Nvidia in January and asked it to invest in the chipmaker. The US government has since made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel itself, which is now estimated to be worth $13 billion as a result of Intel's share price rising by near 23% off the back of yesterday's news.

I mean, who would have thought a few years ago that Intel would become financially unstable, dropping projects and thousands of staff , and then randomly announce a sizeable investment from Nvidia and a plan to collaborate on new chips ? Not many folks, that's for sure. Likewise, I should imagine only die-hard Team Red fans at the start of the decade would have predicted that the best choice for a new CPU , regardless of price point or use scenario, would be an AMD processor. And yet, all of the above have come to pass, and in the case of the last point, we've decided it's time to change our recommendation for the best budget gaming CPU. That honour used to go to Intel's Core i5 13400F , but no longer, as AMD's Ryzen 5 7600X is the sensible choice. (Image credit: Future) There's nothing actually wrong with the 13400F, as such, it's just that the 7600X is simply a better option. It's faster in games, and because it uses AMD's AM5 processor socket, you get far superior upgrade options. With the Core i5 13400F, all you can do is replace it with a 13th Gen or 14th Gen Core i7 or i9 chi…",

One thing I didn't focus on too much in my piece exploring the tech , but which certainly stuck out to me during my conversations, is just how inevitable many seem to think this technology is. This came through most strongly from my discussion with Tiago Sada, chief product officer at Tools for Humanity . This company makes 'Orb' iris scanners for World , a Sam Altman co-founded company that's looking to create a global network of verified humans. The idea with proof-of-human/liveness detection is to, well, detect and prove that you're human, the goal being to combat bots on online services—even services such as gaming. Sada thinks that having some form of this tech across the board is inevitable: \"I think, if you look far ahead enough, let's say, like, five or 10 years, I have a lot of conviction that every single thing we do on the internet—whether it's a game, an app, a website—it will require proof-of-human.

    "body": "Our Jeremy said it best when he reported on the surprise announcement of an Intel-Nvidia collaboration yesterday: it's cats living with dogs. Naturally, such a strange occurrence has led people to question just how it will affect current product roadmaps—especially Intel Arc. On that front, thankfully, Intel says things are business as usual. An Intel spokesperson has supplied a statement to the media saying that: \"collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings\" (via PC World and Hot Hardware ). That's pretty unambiguous, at least for the short term. Intel's roadmap, to be clear, currently includes at least two new generations of processor containing its Arc Xe3 iGPUs: Panther Lake and Nova Lake. The former should launch relatively soon, will be mobile (ie, laptop)-only, and will at least in part be made using the company's new 18A node—although early yields apparently aren't looking too promising . The latter will arrive later and should have both desktop and mobile options, just like current-gen Arrow Lake, and looks to be made on TSMC's N2 node. One key bit in the midst of this is that Arc Xe architecture and outside of t…",

Few were going to make time for a handsome but orthodox pixel art metroidvania when the joys and indignities of Pharloom beckon. Except me: I needed a break from Silksong earlier this week, mostly because I was getting my ass kicked, but also because a small detail on the Adventure of Samsara Steam page piqued my interest. This is actually a spiritual sequel of sorts to the 1980 game Adventure , which was probably the most cryptic and sprawling Atari 2600 cart on the market. Adventure gave me nightmares as a child. Whereas most Atari 2600 games were cheerfully straightforward one-screen arcade games or scrolling shooters, Adventure had designs on being a full-blown, well, adventure, and it displayed some proto-metroidvania qualities to that end.

That's good news for Resident Evil fans who might otherwise be a bit wary about yet another new Resi movie—the film franchise was already rebooted once, just four years ago, with the thoroughly mid Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Cregger's track record, though based on a small sample size (at least when it comes to feature films) is a good reason to be optimistic. And for those wondering which game and characters this new Resi movie will be based on, it looks like the answer is: none of them. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Cregger confirmed that while the 2026 film will take place in the Resident Evil universe, \"It's an entirely original story,\" instead of being based on any one specific game. Cregger is also steering away from major Resident Evil characters like Leon S. Kennedy. \"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story.

Thanks to the efforts of a Tokyo contributor who was able to review the case file for the ongoing Pocketpair lawsuit, videogame patent law site Games Fray (which broke last week's Nintendo patent story) reports that part of Pocketpair's defense against Nintendo's lawsuit aims to invalidate Nintendo's patent claims based on the existence of prior art in mods. (Image credit: Pocketpair / Toasted Shoes / The Pokemon Company) As IP attorney Kirk Sigmon told PC Gamer last September, demonstrable prior art—meaning preexisting work resembling the invention described in a patent's claims—is bad news for patent holders, because it means they shouldn't have been granted the patent in the first place.

Borderlands 4 is currently sitting at a \"Mixed\" rating on Steam, and a quick glance shows that nearly every negative review is about performance issues (with some adding \"don't blame the consumer\" for Pitchford's benefit). PCG's Nick Evanson notes that \"every major Borderlands game has run like a bag of frogs juggling bowling balls on release\" and this time is no exception. \"We're reading every piece of feedback you share,\" says the Gearbox statement , which makes you feel a little bad for the poor staffer charged with that duty. \"We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming [today].

If that sounds like the beginning of a eulogy…yeah. It isn't technically dead, and there's a universe where BioWare makes some incredible comeback with Mass Effect 4, but I don't think it's this one. After Andromeda, Anthem, and Veilguard, it seems that no matter the talent still left in the studio, EA just isn't going to give BioWare the time or trust to make the kind of RPGs it originally spearheaded anymore. I'm finally ready to let go. If you too are mourning the studio's effective downfall, rest assured that the BioWare-style RPG lives on elsewhere. My colleague Fraser Brown insisted back in 2023 that the BioWare-style RPG was dead and just didn't know it yet.

Having tested the game on a broad range of hardware, I can tell you now that it's actually all fine, even when the performance is lower than you'd like. This is especially true if you stick to 1080p or 1440p, and even though Dying Light: The Beast proudly wears an 'I love upscaling' t-shirt, you should have no problems getting a respectable frame rate on most modern gaming PCs.

The Ryzen 5 7600X3D chip in the OcUK Mach 5R excited me because it feels like a perfect compromise pick. You're still getting that sweet, sweet 3D V-Cache technology and the gaming performance boosts that come with it, but at a lower price point than usual, which allows you to throw a little more cash at the points that really matter to you. Being a six-core CPU with 96 MB of L3 cache, it's sort of like a Ryzen 7 7800X3D (the CPU in my home rig) but with two fewer cores and a lower clock speed. When it launched late last year, it was initially a US-only Micro Center exclusive, with limited availability. In a rig like this, one with a beefy GPU but at a mid-range price point, getting 3D cache for the cheapest possible seems like a smart play. I was initially worried that games like Borderlands 4, whose official system specs name an eight-core CPU as a minimum , would mean the rig would be bottlenecked. Turns out,…",

    "body": "When I played (and praised) Hello Kitty Island Adventure at its PC launch in January , I quickly noted that it would be a wasted opportunity to not add new areas with more Sanrio characters, on top of the core cast Friendship Island was already home to. After all, there are so many characters in Sanrio's wheelhouse that deserve a place in the game and that so many people already love. However, the announcement of the game's first DLC, Wheatflour Wonderland , still surprised me. It wasn't until I got into the magical new realm that I realised DLCs like this open up a whole new set of possibilities for Hello Kitty Island Adventure, and frankly I am shocked it's taken Sunblink this long to make one. Wheatflour Wonderland not only introduces Cogimyun, an incredibly underrated character in Sanrio's roster, but an entire new significantly sized area for you to explore, filled with new critters, ingredients, and puzzles to solve. On top of that, Wheatflour Wonderland comes with its own story involving the friends you've made, in an adventure ripped straight from Sailor Moon which would make my pink-frilled, six-year-old self sing. There's a whole lot more here than I was expecting, which…",

What you've made here is an AI-powered Tribble , and now those of us in the US and the UK can pick one up for $429 / £369 . The once-Japan-only device is said to be many things, including a calming presence, a quiet reassurance, and something that \"responds, understands, and grows with you.\" Essentially, it's an AI trapped inside a cuddly robotic fursuit, and one that Casio seems to think is perfect for stress relief ( via Digital Trends ). The Moflin is capable of moving and tilting its head, responding to light and touch, and listening to your darkest fantas... I mean, your vocalisations through a built-in microphone. Not only that, but it'll adjust its behaviour based on an AI-powered emotional spectrum, which Casio says allows it to \"express a diverse range of feelings.\" It can be grumpy, thrilled, joyful, anxious, lonely, calm, happy... in fact, it sounds like a right needy little git, and that's apparently part of the appeal.
