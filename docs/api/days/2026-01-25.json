Our list is drawn from boxofficemojo.com’s running tally of the 1,000 top-grossing films of all time in terms of worldwide grosses. Grosses for Wicked: For Good have slowed to a trickle in the past couple of weeks, but the film is likely to top $525 million in worldwide grosses this week. Both Wicked: For Good and its predecessor, 2024’s Wicked , were adapted from the 2003 Broadway musical Wicked . The first Wicked film opened on Nov. 22, 2024. In just five weeks, it pulled ahead of Mamma Mia! to become the top-grossing film adapted from a Broadway musical. Wicked received 10 Oscar nominations on Jan. 23, 2025, including nods for both of its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande . It won two awards at the Oscars ceremony on March 2, 2025 — best costume design and best production design. Wicked: For Good was shut out in the nominations that were announced on Thursday Jan. 22.

Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums.

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority When Google started its operations in the late 1990s, it set out to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” Despite continual, and sometimes secretive, iteration, the clause remains intact in its mission statement. With the AI boom, Google wants to make information accessible without any significant effort, and is extending these principles beyond web search. Last month, it extended the same altruistic virtues to Google Drive, where you now see AI overview-style summaries for your folders . With this change, Google’s AI will look through your folders, any directories within them, the files stored in them, and even the contents of those files, so you can find whatever you’re looking for immediately. These “smart” features in Google Drive are available to all paying Gemini subscribers and Workspace users. Google says it saves time and helps you discover files buried under several layers of folders. But I’m deeply unsettled by Google raking through my files — especially without my explicit consent — and the only solution I feel I have now is to stop trusting Google with anything private.",

    "body": "Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl has hinted at a return to Australia — and confirmed a new album is finished — during the band’s one-off Tasmanian show over the weekend. The U.S. rock veterans played a sold-out marathon set at UTAS Stadium in Launceston on Saturday (Jan. 24), marking their first Tasmanian performance in more than a decade and their debut concert in the state’s second-largest city. The show, which ran close to three hours, was the band’s only Australian date on the current visit. Late in the set, Grohl addressed the crowd with a major update on the band’s next chapter, confirming that Foo Fighters have recently completed work on a new record. “We might have a whole new record of f***ing songs that we just finished the other day,” Grohl told the audience, delivering the first public confirmation that a follow-up to 2023’s But Here We Are is complete. Grohl also hinted strongly that fans won’t have to wait long to see the band back on Australian soil. “This won’t be the last time you see us,” he said. “We’ll be back here sooner than you think… and it’s before my next birthday.” Grohl’s birthday falls on Jan. 14, suggesting Foo Fighters could return to Australia befor…",

When Smallzy referenced a side-eye emoji Tomlinson had previously left in response to a fan asking about Australian dates, the former One Direction member leaned fully into the speculation. “I always find the question kind of funny because as long as I’ve been touring, I’ve always come to Aus. It’s inevitable,” Tomlinson said. “I love it there, I love it. So yeah, I’ll definitely, definitely be there. I think we’re just — it can’t be too long until we announce, to be honest.” As Smallzy jokingly cautioned against giving fans false hope, Tomlinson doubled down. “No, it’s happening. Don’t mind them.

Australian artists were particularly prominent throughout the countdown, continuing a trend that has defined recent editions of the Hottest 100.

However, not every reader agreed with me, and some mentioned a name I hadn’t heard (or used) in years: SwiftKey . I was once an avid SwiftKey user, opting for the innovative keyboard early in my Android journey over Google’s simpler default option. The allure of the more efficient and sensibly designed Google alternative eventually drew me away as I upgraded to more polished devices. But, given that we’ve just started a new year, could the reverse be true? Could SwiftKey challenge Gboard on my devices going forward?",

I use Notion and have spent way too much time just setting up my system within the app, choosing the correct icons, and making sure the colors match across my pages. Because I spent so much time tweaking it, I feel like I have to put it to use, so I try to write down as much as humanly possible to achieve that feeling of being on top of things that matter.

    "body": "TL;DR A Trump Mobile executive teased a higher-end “T1 Ultra” in a November interview. That’s despite no one who ordered the original Trump phone having received it yet. The executive claims that customers are “eager to buy into” the successor. My colleague C. Scott Brown put down his $100 deposit for the Trump phone seven months ago, and it still hasn’t turned up . At least he ordered it for professional reasons (I think), but no one who excitedly pre-ordered the T1 phone has seen any sign of it yet. That hasn’t stopped Trump Mobile from thinking about what comes next. According to a company executive, a higher-end “T1 Ultra” may also be in the works. The Verge spotted a largely overlooked interview from November with Trump Mobile executive Don Hendrickson. Speaking to Wireless Dealer Magazine at the time, Hendrickson teased a second phone before the first one had made it into customers’ hands.",

Research has previously shown that meteorites may have been a significant source of Earth’s water as they bombarded our planet early in the solar system’s development.

At the time, enabling this look took some tinkering — but now, the new light theme is rolling out publicly in multiple versions of the Photos Android app. The editing view for Google Photos has historically featured a dark gray background. That’s easier on the eyes when using your phone in a dark room, but it might not always be what you want. After an apparent server-side update that’s hitting users this week, that background will match your device theme: dark gray on dark mode, light gray for light mode.",

For many of us, Google Wallet has become the ever-growing storehouse for not just our credit or debit cards but also our passes, IDs, vouchers, and virtually everything else that needs to be conserved digitally. However, as it grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage or sort, which is why Google has been building search functionality for Wallet for quite some time. A little over a year ago, we saw Wallet’s Search UI in its early form .

The Xiaomi Tag will likely use a CR2032 battery and may come in two versions, including one with Ultra-Wideband (UWB). A global launch is not yet confirmed, but if it pans out, it could potentially democratize Bluetooth trackers and significantly boost Android’s Find Hub network. We’ve seen a handful of Android-compatible Bluetooth trackers released over the years, but the market is largely untapped, if Apple’s success with AirTags is any indication. Motorola recently announced its Moto Tag 2 tracker, but there’s still plenty of space in the market for other Android brands to launch their offerings. It seems Xiaomi has decided to finally enter this space, as a new leak shows off the upcoming Xiaomi Tag. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

When someone asked me for a recommendation — be it someone looking to upgrade to a no-nonsense, feature-packed smartphone, or a tinkerer looking for a platform to play around with — my answer was always a OnePlus smartphone . Between the great hardware, clean software out of the box, and a price tag that skirted well below other flagships, it was the safe recommendation. However, more than that, a OnePlus smartphone has traditionally been a smartphone that was, more or less, fully under your control. If the phone was out of the software update guarantee period, you could install a custom ROM to breathe new life into it. If you didn’t like a software update, you could revert to the previous version. Or, if you just wanted to tinker around with hardware you owned, you could. Unfortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

Now Brief tries to be a travel companion Of all of the things Now Brief is supposed to be able to do, I wanted it to show me ETAs for upcoming events. The idea is simple — Now Brief looks at calendar events with a tagged location, checks where you are, and then works out when you should leave to get there on time. If that sounds familiar to you, that’s probably because that’s one of the many useful things that Google Now did back in the day.",

Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured.

It’s not yet clear if there’s any real support behind this effort, but if there is, it could become official by as soon as May. Life must have been a lot simpler 100 years ago. Not easier , certainly, but definitely without so many modern-day distractions. Back in 1926, lawmakers in Kentucky first got it into their heads to nominate a bird — the northern cardinal — as their state’s official avian ambassador, and pretty much everybody followed that lead with a state bird of their own . Now in 2026, when there’s clearly nothing more pressing for politicians to be worrying about, we’re hearing about the first nomination of an official state smartphone platform .

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud. Stephen found that focus particularly useful for building his confidence to practice in the real world.",

General availability starts in March. Need another device in your home to make noise at you throughout the day? Nintendo’s got you covered. Following an initial tease in September, pre-orders are now open for the company’s Talking Flower toy. Based on a chatty character from Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the gadget will pipe up every half hour or so to tell you the time, quote lines from the game, or just kind of say whatever. An overview video published by Nintendo today explains what the Talking Flower can do. The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button. It seems, well, annoying — and if you’ve played Wonder, you’ll know that’s a faithful adaptation of the character.",

Not all of us are musically inclined, though, which is why we were so excited when Google introduced a new feature for its Recorder app with the Pixel 10 that used AI to help us create music .

Prompted Playlist debuted in beta in New Zealand last month. It’s now expanding to the US and Canada. Last month, Spotify introduced a feature it calls Prompted Playlist . Prompted Playlist uses AI to generate custom playlists based on your text input, which can be as broad or specific as you like. The feature has been exclusive to testers in New Zealand, but today, Spotify announced that Prompted Playlist is rolling out in beta in the US and Canada. As described in a new blog post from Spotify , Prompted Playlist can make just about any playlist you could think up. You can ask for tracks from a specific genre or set of genres, tracks originally released within a specific span of time, tracks that Spotify has tagged as matching a certain mood — if you can describe a playlist, Prompted Playlist can make it.",

Gemini is slowly but surely replacing Google Assistant throughout Google’s smart home ecosystem. While we wait for a broader rollout, most Google Home users just want the basics to work again.

Instead of recording the caller’s message as a voicemail, it may allow them to hear you in the background. The bug appears to affect all supported Pixel phones, starting with the Pixel 4. If you have no time to go through all your voicemails, Google’s “Take a Message” feature for Pixel devices can be really useful. If you miss or decline a call, Take a Message can automatically spin into action, informing the caller that you’re unavailable and asking them to record a message. While it sounds like voicemail, the feature uses AI to transcribe the message and automatically store it in your Pixel’s call history, where you can revisit it later. While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well. While very useful in theory, it has reportedly been malfunctioning, letting callers hear you instead of recording their message. Several users have highlighted this issue with Take a Message on their Pixel phones over the last few months. These reports, spotted by 9to5Google , are not limited…",

The increase is part of T-Mobile’s Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee, which is now $4.99 a month. This is the second hike of $0.50 since last year, but you’ll be spared if your monthly plan already includes federal taxes and telco fees. If you’re a T-Mobile customer in the US , your bill just went up overnight. That’s because the carrier is adding an auxiliary charge, separate from your monthly payment plan. As of Wednesday, January 21, T-Mobile is increasing its “Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee” to $4.99 per voice line and $2.10 per mobile data line. That’s a $0.50 increase compared to before this date, when the fee per voice line was $3.99. If you have multiple lines in your plan, the total should reflect on your bill starting this month. T-Mobile updated its bill breakdown support page (via Droid-Life ) to reflect the new prices.",

Like Hydra, the platform appears to regenerate as quickly as one of it’s somains is cut back. Earlier this month, shadow library Anna’s Archive, infamous for scraping 300TB of Spotify’s most played songs , suddenly lost its main .org domain. At the time, the site’s operator downplayed the situation, saying that domain takedowns for sites like theirs happen often . They insisted it had nothing to do with their recent scraping of Spotify at a massive scale. But unsealed documents now show how Spotify, along with top music labels, pulled off a legal ambush and shut down Anna’s Archive.",

A few weeks back, that option seems to have gone away for everyone, replaced with an on-device “nightlight” mode. While not yet confirmed, the timing of this change and the rise of Gemini for Home feel possibly related. Gemini has arrived for Google Home, and that’s changing the experience for users everywhere — for better or for worse. While Gemini offers the possibility of much richer AI interactions, users have been worried about losing valued functionality along the way, like Assistant’s useful Continued Conversation mode. Google’s made a pretty strong commitment to supporting its older smart home hardware , but the question of third-party support has been less certain. Today we’re checking out what appears to be one big downgrade that’s hitting just such a third-party device. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.
