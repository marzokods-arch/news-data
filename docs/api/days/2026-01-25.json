Thanks to Sydney-based web developer Arin Sarkisian, Doom now runs on a pair of earbuds. More specifically, it runs on the PineBuds Pro , which Sarkisian explains on his site are \"the only earbuds with open source firmware.\" The buds have a CPU strong enough to run Doom with some minor tweaks—the site notes Sarkisian \"cranked [the CPU] up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode,\" providing \"more than enough\" juice to run the game, albeit at around 18 fps. Doom itself also required some tweaking so that the buds' meager RAM could handle the game, but the site explains \"there are plenty of optimisations\" that can cut down on Doom's required 4 MB of RAM.

Because while player cops in GTA roleplay servers are nothing new—I first happened upon the homemade law-serving scene back in 2017—having spent the last few weeks revisiting some of my favourite servers (and dipping my toe into some new ones), there's definitely a bit of a blue-line renaissance going on out there on the crime-ridden streets of Los Santos and Blaine County right now. Across major FiveM and RageMP communities, joining the LSPD isn't a case of spawn-in and sound the whaler either, it's a proper ordeal.

As they have done with other N64 favorites before, recompilation mad lad Wiseguy and co. are here to save the day. Yesterday, a trailer for Banjo: Recompiled went up on YouTube seemingly out of nowhere and with it, a full native port of the original Banjo-Kazooie for Windows, Linux, and Mac was shared on GitHub along with its source code. You'll need to bring your own game files, but plug the ROM in and it just works. It's remarkably crisp and feature-rich, offering a superior experience to emulation while demanding less from your computer. Some of those features include support for higher framerates, widescreen and ultrawide aspect ratios, and an extensive options menu where you can change control mappings and switch to a dual analog camera.

In fact, developer Big Distraction says it made the game because it got fed up of waiting for Gearbox to make another Risk of Rain. If you've played Risk of Rain 2, you'll know that it can be pretty tough, especially if you're heading into its alien wildernesses on your own. Such is the case with Lort. However, it seems some players are unhappy with the game's balancing, and their complaints are primarily why 28% of reviews are negative on Steam . On Friday, Big Distraction released an update to Lort making some adjustments to its challenge. But they also don't seem entirely happy about it. In a Steam post accompanying the update, Big Distraction addressed the issue of Lort's challenge. While it doesn't quite amount to \"git gud\", Big Distraction said that players shouldn't come to Lort expecting an easy ride. \"Lort is a roguelike and isn't meant to be a super easy game,\" the post reads. \"You are meant to die and learn how to overcome the challenge of each new level, enemy and boss.

With Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 falling flat on its face and Battlefield 6 struggling to maintain its promising initial momentum, I've turned increasingly to the throwback deathmatch joys of Straftat and the cooperative combat shenanigans of 2024's Echo Point Nova . Now, new indie challenger Doku Games has entered the arena with Out of Action , a PvP FPS that aspires to be the darling of movement kids everywhere. Out of Action doesn't look all that in screenshots, with generic-looking cyborg ninjas battling in aggressively grey arenas. But it springs to acrobatic life when in motion. Its cyberpunk-ish warriors can shoot-dodge, slide across floors, run along walls, rebound off walls, and perform first-person somersaults in midair. It's enough to make Max Payne motion sick. On the subject of Max Payne , Doku Games also promises \"advanced multiplayer bullet-time\". The S…",

But he discovered that its cutesy visuals and gentle onboarding belied a game of serious puzzling depth. \"As a puzzle it becomes exponentially tricky. Each asteroid or planet only houses a small number of possible resources, making effective shipping between them vital,\" he wrote in September last year. \"It starts to feel like trying to fit all the components of a circuit board in a functioning layout on the surface of a potato.\" Up to this point, Star Birds' puzzling has been limited to synthetic resource production. Now, though, things are about to get more involved with the addition of organic production chains. Earlier this week, Toukana introduced its Flora & Fauna update to Star Birds, adding alien plants, food production, and a frankly concerning number of tentacles. Much of this revolves around the new star system players can explore. Paradeira is a green and pleasant sector of space bustling with organic life. Primarily, this life can be…",

A significant chunk of the appeal of them, just like The Elder Scrolls, is the option to flick back and forth between first-person and third-person at the press of a button. When I'm in a cramped tunnel full of ghouls with an air-cooled automatic rifle and a depleting supply of .308 rounds, I want to be in claustrophobic first-person. When I'm jogging across the countryside in a duster, or swinging a golf club at Fiends coming from every direction, I want to be in open third-person. Modders have tended to focus on first-person animations, both because it's the more popular view and the easiest to tweak. Which is why it's taken until now for modder Wombat to bless us with a full third-person animation overhaul for Fallout: New Vegas. And yes, it does cover NPCs as well. Enhanced Animations – 3rd Person Movement is apparently the first in a series of planned Enhanced Animation mods. As Wombat explains, \"It covers all general movement animations when standing, which include idle, walking, running, jumping, and landing animations, all with directional variants.

Rubbing some salt in the wound, Reddit posts claiming to come from a developer who worked on the project say that \"it was close to the finish line.\" The redditor, posting under the name SocramVelmar, wrote \"Although the game was close to release, development stopped suddenly due to internal uncertainty and concerns around layoffs. With things unclear, some of the team moved on to other studios that offered more stability.\" If it was close to completion, you may be wondering, why not put in a little more effort to get it out the door?

This is distinct from the irregular preproduction work that came before, as well as the even more blistering, seven days a week schedule he kept during the game's final stretch in 1997. Cain would wake up at 6:00 AM, take care of his cat, then reach the office by 7:00⁠—homemade loaf of bread in hand⁠, recipe helpfully under the video's top comment—to get an early start on coding tasks when there were no meetings to interrupt him.

Cain's lunch habits⁠—he would return home to make something each day⁠—touch on an economic reality that makes me wish I was born 20 years earlier.

There's been some drama in the World of Warcraft community—I know, we live in a wild and mad world—over its overhauled transmog system , and I can't say it's entirely unwarranted. For the completely uninitiated, 'transmog' is a very fancy MMO lingo word for 'playing dressup', and for World of Warcraft: Midnight, Blizzard's changed the entire economy around how it works. Before this week's pre-patch, players could create and save outfits, which would apply a sort of 'new skin' over their existing gear. If they got a new piece of gear, it'd pop up in their currently-equipped item, requiring them to visit an NPC to re-apply the transmog over it again.

A normal match of Deadlock is familiar MOBA fare and is therefore extremely stressful.

Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . Before I played No Players Online, I knew nothing about it, except that it was a horror game set in a server for an abandoned multiplayer FPS. In some ways it is exactly that, but in others it is not really that at all. If that description seems confounding, then it is only accurate to my experience with this deeply strange game, which is at once a fairly derivative horror experience and one of the oddest puzzlers I've ever played. Even the history of No Players Online is confusing. I've been vaguely aware of the game for years, but it turns out that the No Players Online I was familiar with is not the No Players Online I just played. The commercial version that launched late last year and costs $15 is based upon a free, short game released back in 2019, developed by Adam Pype with sound design by Viktor Kraus and addit…",

    "body": "More quizzes! (Image credit: Larian Studios, PC Gamer) Want to keep testing your knowledge of gaming trivia? We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I love a classic videogame dungeon. Give me dark caves and dripping ceilings. Give me puzzle doors and weird keys. Give me traps under every flagstone and monsters in every room. The best dungeons are burned into my brain as some of my favourite levels of all time, lurking forever in the shadows of my memory like a gang of 2d4 skeletons. But how well do you remember your years of excursions in the underworld? Our latest quiz tests exactly that, challenging you to match each ominously titled dungeon to its game of origin. Only the kind of seasoned adventurer who knows their Underearth from their Underdark and their Dredmor from their Deadmines will prevail. It's multiple choice, so even when you're stumped you can at least make a guess—but remember that down in the dark, giving the wrong answer to a riddle can have dire consequences… Let us know how you did in the comments below!",

But a new trailer reveals that The Killing Stone will be ready for business next month, and I'm beginning to think it might be one of the early bangers of 2026. The Killing Stone is a card battler with demonic overtones that owes at least some of its soul to 2021's Inscryption . The meat of the experience is a simulated board-game where you play cards that come to life as little critters. These critters form up in a line on the board, fighting to destroy a lidless eye that represents each player's life. Destroy your opponent's eye and you can move on to the next battle. If your eye gets poked to oblivion on the other hand, well, let's just say the results aren't to your advantage. Surrounding this mechanical core is a narrative meta-layer where you explore the spooky house of an old magus, researching upgrades to improve your chances of beating the game and entreating with its curious denizens. As you can hear in the trailer, the game boasts some hefty voice-acting talent…",

That mod is Marrow , a new campaign for Monolith's deviously difficult and ferociously violent shooter. It's sort of Blood's equivalent of John Romero's Sigil —a continuation of Blood's storyline that concluded with protagonist Caleb slaying his demonic former master Tchernobog. Like Sigil, Marrow restricts itself to Blood's original assets (weapons, enemies etc) to power the experience, focussing instead on using those assets to build large and complex new maps for the game. Episode One of Marrow has been out for a while, releasing back in 2023. Marrow's creator, Nick Palsmier, intended to issue a general release of Chapter 2 as close to the launch of Nightdive's 2025 remaster as he could.

One of these is side-scrolling soulslike The Last Faith , which aims to do for Bloodborne what Blasphemous did for Catholicism and religious dogma, squeezing out its darkest juices into a 2D, metroidvania-shaped glass.

Instead, Geoff Keighley cued up a trailer for an unknown hero shooter called Highguard. It didn't go great. The social media reaction was instantly hostile. Highguard was received as a 'one more thing' trespasser that had claimed an unearned seat of honor, although its developer did not pay for the slot as many assumed. The reveal has become a case study in how not to announce a game, but what really got people worked up is what Highguard's developer did next: nothing. Highguard is launching on Steam next week, but the studio still hasn't said anything new about it publicly, aside from a tweet today announcing a livestream. Starved for a new trailer to dunk on in the endless competition to win the social media Cynicism Cup, posters have had to settle for generic declarations of Highguard's cookedness. That cynicism-for-cynicism's-sake aside, it feels safe to say that general distrust of this kind of game is at an all-time high. In Highguard's case, you do get a whiff of hubris fro…",

Rolling for the most powerful characters is only half the game; the rest is building the most efficient material processing plant you can. Now that everyone's realized what kind of game they're actually playing, someone went and built an entire simulator for designing factory blueprints to share with other players. EndfieldTools is currently getting slammed with traffic because it's the best spot for sharing factory blueprints and testing out layouts without having to waste resources in-game. The factory planner is essentially a simplified version of the real thing with tools to simulate how efficient your setup truly is.

My cold take: New Vegas is still my favorite entry in the series, including the 2D originals. My hot take: Fallout 4 is a vastly superior game to Fallout 3, and deserves more credit than it gets in RPG snob circles. The writing is much better than you remember, with more interesting quests and characters than Fallout 3⁠. The color, vibrancy, and general art direction look fresh even 10 years on. The gunplay is so much better and more satisfying than the prior 3D Fallouts, and the weapon customization is a genuine advancement over what you see in New Vegas.

Players loved that tech demo so much the sim quickly rocketed onto Steam's list of top wishlists, where it now sits in slot number 10 alongside big-budget games like Ark 2 and Forza Horizon 6. Well, sharpen your sword and polish your armor, because Half Sword is ready to spill its guts all over early access: it launches Friday, January 30. That's just next week! To celebrate, the developer, aptly named Half Sword Games, released a comically grisly new trailer set to a soundtrack of what I'll call one of the most delightfully unhinged songs ever written for a game in history. Watch and listen for yourself: The trailer begins with some bare-fisted boxing, but that quickly escalates to people's faces being pulverised on the ground or against wooden posts.

Jobs have been lost and multiple games have been cancelled, including the long-delayed and much-wanted remake of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. While the fate of Ubisoft's many studios is the more pressing concern (including staff already going on strike), along with the threat of a pivot towards even more live service games and generative AI, a gamer-level problem is that one of Ubi's most iconic adventures exists in a surprisingly sorry state. Fortunately we're PC gaming nerds, and we know how to solve such problems. Where to buy Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time If you don't already own a modern digital copy of Sands Of Time, you've got a few options. The first and most convenient is Steam , where the game goes for around $12 (£9). At the time of writing, the Ubisoft Store has the game discounted down to under $3 (£2), although, yes, you'll have to download it through their app. You can launch it through Steam after doing so. The third option is GOG , but you might want to wait just to buy there: At the time of writing, GOG has just announced th…",

The letter's signatories, led by Labor Caucus co-chairs Steven Horsford, Debbie Dingell, Mark Pocan, and Donald Norcross, say they have \"serious concerns\" that the acquisition will lead to layoffs, studio closures, wage suppression, and an unwelcome concentration of sports and entertainment brand ownership that could lead to \"anticompetitive coordination.\" Median worker pay at EA has declined steeply year over year, the letter states, a trend that suggests the company \"may already face limited competitive pressure to retain or reward talent.\" It goes on to say that EA has eliminated more than 1,700 jobs since 2023 and warns that even deeper cuts could result if the acquisition is closed because of the massive debt financing involved, \"which creates strong incentives for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting mea…",

So when I stumbled across the Isometric NYC city map project, I was at first properly stoked—and then deeply conflicted. Isometric NYC is the one-man effort of Andy Coenen, attempting to render all of New York City in an isometric pixel art style distinctly reminiscent of the SimCity series . But rather than laboriously building this city pixel-by-pixel, Coenen has instead leveraged multiple AI agents to create this city map. The entire process required much more work than dashing off a handful of prompts, but you are perhaps beginning to understand my sense of conflict. Coenen himself is a software engineer currently conducting AI research at Google DeepMind . He explains that the original idea for Isometric NYC was to use Google's \" Nano Banana to generate a pixel art map from satellite imagery tile-by-tile,\" though Coenen ultimately used…",

That's all according to Intel's Q4 earnings call, where CFO David Zinsner said, \"2025 demonstrated the staying power of the x86 ecosystem across client and datacenter, and the importance of our manufacturing assets as we launched Core Ultra Series 3 on Intel 18A, the most advanced process fully developed and manufactured in the United States. Both create a firm foundation on which to build the new Intel\" ( transcript via Seeking Alpha ). On 18A, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said, \"While we still have work to do, I'm encouraged by the steady progress on our Intel 18A use, and Naga [executive Vice President and Foundry lead] and his team remain laser-focused on additional improvements as they ramp Series 3 into the high volume needed to meet strong customer demand.\" Intel is split into a few major segments: the part that designs chips that go into desktops / laptops / handhelds ; and Intel Foundry, its semiconductor manufacturing division, which also offers to make chips for other companies these days.

Enter Escalation, four themed monthly updates from January to April 2026, which will see everything from new map conditions, projects, and Expeditions , to a brand-new map, small and large Arcs, and an update to our dearest Scrappy. We'll also get new quests , events, items, and other additions throughout the year. You can see the new early 2026 Arc Raiders roadmap below: (Image credit: Embark Studios) January's Headwinds update might look on the slim side, but it kicks things off with a welcome addition: level 40+ matchmaking. This should help give new players an easier time as they get to grips with all the horrors Topside.

    "body": "Asus first introduced the ROG Azoth range a couple of years ago to straddle the line between traditional gaming keyboards and the more enthusiast-grade options that had skyrocketed in popularity. The original ROG Azoth was a triumph that walked the tricky line wonderfully, packing in nice-to-haves such as lubricated switches, reliable wireless connectivity and hot-swappable powers into a smart, compact chassis. This new ROG Azoth 96 HE takes some of what Asus has built up to this point and tears it up. For instance, it's not mechanical in the same sense as its predecessors (or siblings, I suppose), as Asus has opted to go for its ROG HFX V2 Hall effect switches for gaming precision and power, rather than the increased tactility of a traditional mechanical switch. These have been upgraded over the older V1 switches kitted out to other Asus keyboards with Hall effect powers and were first seen on the Asus ROG Falcata , with optimisations such as a shorter overall travel (3.5 mm vs 4 mm) that's more noticeable in use than you'd think, plus a larger magnet for more precise customisation. It's now possible to set the actuation or reset point in increments of 0.01 mm, which is not somet…",

Steve Downes takes particular issue with the nightmare scenario of AI being trained on real-life voice recordings to imitate those actors, whether living or dead. In a YouTube AMA ( spotted by GamesRadar+ ) Downes says he never wants to see AI used to replicate his voice. \"That's where we cross a line that gets into an area that I am uncomfortable with,\" says Downes. \"I'm not a proponent. I don't like it, and I would prefer that it not be done.\" Perhaps conscious that he works in an industry where AI use is increasingly widespread, and does offer limited use cases, Downes does go on to slightly soften his stance outside of the topic of his own voice. AI can have \"many, many positive effects on not only showbusiness but humanity in general\" says Downes, but \"can also be something that deprives the actor of his work. I'll go on the record with that.\" It's not quite Neil Newborn, Astarian in Baldur's Gate 3 among many other things, coming out and saying of AI : \"It's shit… AI sucks.\" But at least it shows…",

I'm sure I speak for us all when I say: thank god. Well, not all of us. To hear Fulton tell it, cutting the dog is a cross he has to bear at the studio. \"I did know I was going to get this question. And do you know what? There are some folks on the team that were relishing me getting this question because I cut it a while back.\" Why did Fulton Old-Yeller Old Yeller? He seems almost too irate at the social cost it's incurred to say: \"For development reasons, right? I don't need to go into any more detail than that, except to say there are a substantial number of people on the team who have yet to forgive me for that decision.\" In response to IGN prodding him about maybe sticking a dog in the sequel, he concedes, \"I hear you on that.

An unfair comparison considering the desktop chip doesn’t have to deal with the constrained thermal envelope and limited power draw of a laptop, and the 3D V-Cache really does make a difference. Despite the rainbow keyboard and presence of an RTX 5080 GPU, you’ll be surprised to hear this this isn’t a gaming laptop. MSI positions it as “engineered for the demands of STEM professionals,” which probably doesn’t mean gardeners, and then takes a puff on some burning leaves to huskily exhale the phrase “it operates like a high-tech brain”. Yeah, man. The Vector A18 HX may well “deliver the performance and reliability engineers need to excel in every challenge,” but luckily for us it also delivers the kind of frame rates that make PC gamers very happy, and is so obviously a gaming laptop in an unconvincing disguise with its 240 Hz display, seven heat pipes, and two fans to keep it all cool.
