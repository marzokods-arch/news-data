It's the best handheld gaming PC in many respects, but not really worth all that money, and while it's lacking in some key features, it's apparently easily upgradeable. This last point has come to light thanks to iFixit's recent disassembly of the handheld. The ROG Xbox Ally X has been given the teardown treatment, and it turns out it's surprisingly easily upgradeable, at least in some ways. This has earned it a 7/10 score from iFixit, which isn't quite the 10/10 it awarded the Framework laptop , but is still pretty impressive, especially for a handheld. It's also upgradeable in ways that should be very relevant to many ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X owners (presumably the same applies to the non-X version, too, even though that wasn't tested). This is particularly true when it comes to storage and thumbsticks. The $1,000 handheld comes with a 1 TB SSD, which is decent for a handheld, but if you're paying gaming PC prices for a handheld, more storage than this would be nice. Thankfully, though, the ROG Xbox Ally X has an easily-accessible M.2 slot, so you can swap it out with a new one of your ch…",

That's according to Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation, who says that over the past few months, the site has seen a \"decrease of roughly 8% as compared to the same months in 2024\" in human pageviews. After updating its bot detection systems, the Foundation \"found that much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.\" \"We believe that these declines reflect the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,\" says Miller, \"especially with search engines providing answers directly to searchers, often based on Wikipedia content.\" The AI answers that Google spits up top of the SERPs, in my experience, tend to reference articles from publications—such as yours truly—more so than Wikipedia.

I don't understand Roblox, I don't know why '6 7' is funny, all of my personal habits and peccadilloes have been roasted to cinders by teenagers on TikTok, and I don't have the dexterity or frontier spirit to get into Fortnite. It's fine. It's fine. I'm just waiting for the good Lord to take me. One thing I do understand, though, is The Simpsons, which I was the right age to catch (at least as re-runs) back when it was still good. So even I raised an eyebrow, perhaps two, when leaks began swirling that the entire town of Springfield would be back in map form in Fortnite (via VGC ). That's per Fortnite Nostradamus/Deepthroat/leaks-person-of-note NotPalo , who wrote that Fortnite would be getting a cel-shaded map with separate sections for areas like the Springfield nuclear power plant. There'll also be Simpsons character skins (with, it's said, their own Lego versions for use in Lego maps), and a Simpsons-themed mini-season. Which is all very lovely, but let's cut to the chase. One of the perhaps five things I know about Fortnite is that when they added Peter Griffin to the game, they had to mak…",

As the dust begins to settle and services have, in large part, recovered, it's just left to the analysts to determine exactly how much financial damage was accrued. One such candidate is the CEO of internet monitoring firm Catchpoint, Mehdi Daoudi, who spoke to CNN about the fallout from AWS' rather public faceplant. \"The incident highlights the complexity and fragility of the internet, as well as how much every aspect of our work depends on the internet to work,\" said Daoudi. \"The financial impact of this outage will easily reach into the hundreds of billions due to loss in productivity for millions of workers that cannot do their job, plus business operations that are stopped or delayed— from airlines to factories.\" While that figure initially seems excessive, when you take into account the scope of the outage, it's perhaps not too far out of th…",

The demo wastes no time in immersing you into its world.There's no introduction, no story to follow, you just wake up in a boat in the middle of the sea, engulfed by darkness. From there you're given a prompt on how to sail, but for the most part you just have to figure everything out: where to go, who you are, and who you've just pulled into your boat from the water. There is a significant lack of hand-holding throughout the demo, which is noticeable from the get-go. You're given visual clues to follow, such as red lights floating in the ocean, but aside from that you are left to your own devices. You do have an AI/co-op partner, though. I will say, it is nice having a companion who will occasionally help you out by walking over to a door and calling out to you if you're taking slightly too long to figure things out. …",

    "body": "The MSI MAG Z890 Tomahawk WiFi has been on the market for 12 months, as it was one of the first motherboards to be released alongside Intel's Core Ultra 200S range of desktop CPUs, aka Arrow Lake, in October 2024. At the time, there were few other models to choose from, but that's considerably changed over the months, and MSI faces stiff competition at this price point. The Z890 Tomahawk's original MSRP was $300, though you're more likely to find it around the $260 mark, and while that's not a huge reduction, it brings it more in line with boards from ASRock and Gigabyte. That's not the only thing that's changed since last year, as the performance of Arrow Lake has noticeably improved due to a wealth of microcode, BIOS, and Windows updates. In gaming, Core Ultra 200S still lag behind AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, though. MSI's Tomahawk series of motherboards has been around since 2018, as part of its budget and mainstream selection of products, sporting the MAG (MSI Arsenal Gaming) moniker.

And not just because I yearn for the days when I didn't make weird noises getting up from my chair. See, that was the year Telltale reimagined the adventure game as a narrative-driven social conundrum with The Walking Dead. As a point-and-click diehard, I was sceptical of the change in direction. Telltale had been helping to keep adventure games alive after the genre fell out of favour, and now it was making the switch to something that looked like an interactive TV show. (Image credit: AdHoc Studio) In that first episode of The Walking Dead, my scepticism seemed justified, at least by the brain-dead puzzles—including one that involved an otherwise intelligent character not knowing how to use batteries. But I still found myself eager to follow Lee and Clem's grisly journey, wondering if the social friction could make up for what the puzzles lacked. Dispatch is an evolution of the Telltale style. Those last vestiges of point-and-clicks held it back, but Telltale became more confident throughout the series, and it eventually stopped trying to appease t…",

This and other vital lessons come courtesy of Victoria 3, which is celebrating its third birthday with a few statistics, as has become fashionable . Turns out players are either incredibly bad farmers or incredibly efficient murderers, because in the last 12 months they've starved enough people to death to denude real-life Earth of humans 107 million times over. But it was all worth it, because in the same timespan our plucky players managed to create anarchist Prussia 1,476 times, which is surely deeply distressing if you're Otto von Bismarck and deeply heartening if you are Gustav Landauer. Also, if you are either of those people, welcome back. All this was accomplished in a total of 440,377,653 hours of play, which equals out to about 1.1 billion deaths an hour if my maths is right.

You want to know if you can hook up with any of the immortal bloodsuckers and find romance in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 . I've got good news and bad news. In the World of Darkness, the universe in which Vampire: The Masquerade is contained, romance is kinda complicated. More complicated than usual, I mean. This is because vamps aren't human. Like Phyre themself says, the Beast—the demonic apex predator inside every vampire—hollows them out, removing human emotions like love. With that bit of lore in mind, let's dig in. Can you romance NPCs in Bloodlines 2? (Image credit: Paradox) There is what The Chinese Room calls \"romantic feeding\" in Bloodlines 2, but if you're looking for traditional RPG romance systems then you're out of luck. While vampires can retain some of their humanity—which there's a system for in both the tabletop game and Bloodlines 1, but not the sequel—in most cases their former nature gets squeezed out by the Beast, the source of all their darker proclivities.

Every night, the primogens of Seattle's vampire clans sit around in their havens, waiting for you, Sheriff Phyre, to come and solve things that one of their goons should be handling. The absolute best you can hope for is some murder, being sent to kill a human in need of a beatdown or a ghoul who's gotten too big for its britches.

Yeah, we're talking bottom-of-the-barrel filler quests here—stuff that you'd even roll your eyes at in a quest-laden MMO. In a brisk 20-30 hour narrative-driven RPG, they're unacceptably bad. These quests are devoid of plot, have little to no impact on the rest of the game, and since this is an RPG without gear, the rewards are terribly basic.

For context, that's comparable numbers to indie mega-hit Balatro , which sold 500,000 in its first 10 days and has since gone on to sell in the millions. 300,000!!!in 5 DAYSThank you all!!!!🏐🏐🏐🎉🎉 — @ballxpit.com ( @ballxpit.com.bsky.social ) 2025-10-21T13:27:28.935Z In that time, it's also hit a peak concurrent player count of nearly 35,000 —again, within spitting distance of Balatro's 45,000, and in less than a week. I definitely recommend checking out for yourself, if that popularity has piqued your interest. As I said in my review, Ball X Pit is \"a roller coaster ride of ball-bouncing action that loves to break its own rules\". It combines Breakout-inspired action with Vampire Survivors-like roguelike progression and even a substantial city-building element between runs, and the result is an absolutely deadly 'one more run' effect. Does this mean it's on track to be the next huge phenomenon? All things…",

This (up to) 27-item bundle from Magpie Games contains a couple of other solid systems, too—Avatar Legends (based off Avatar: The Last Airbender) and Root: The Roleplaying Game are included, alongside the gothic horror TTRPG Bluebeard's Pride—which sees players acting out different aspects of a newly wed's psyche as she uncovers the misdeeds of her new captor.

A simple enough concept, but let's just say this one spiralled a bit. And then some. This incredible desk contains 74 hexagonal frames, 44 of which house 37 active RGB cells. Each multi-layered cell can display its status via perspex inserts and multiple LEDs (via Hackaday ). Between the cells are pathways along which the bees travel, again with RGB lights. All told, there are 3,745 LEDs. It's all controlled by software that Full Stack Woodworking also built. And the resulting bee hive simulation is utterly beguiling. But hold that thought, because this labour of love deserves describing. This is a hugely complex desk build. Just making the top layer of the cell frames from African hard wood was an incredibly involved process, requiring several steps to prepare uniformly thin strips of wood ready to be laser cut.

Earlier this year it released its ninth expansion, Grasping Fortune, and now it's gearing up for number 10: Poison Song . This is a big one. Well, they're all big ones, but this is a big one for a new reason . Poison Song means players are finally getting \"one of the holy grails that TR players [have] been waiting for more than twenty years—the ability to join House Indoril.\" This is either the most hype-inducing sentence you've ever heard, or completely meaningless (if you are normal), so let me try to break it down. Base Morrowind let you join any of three different Houses—Morrowind-native political factions that, conveniently, pretty much mapped to each corner of the Fighter-Mage-Thief triad. There was Hlaalu, the Empire-sympathetic merchant guild; Redoran, the traditionalist fighter sect; and Telvanni, dickhead wizards who live in mushrooms.

That's per a post by Yoko Taro , director of the Nier games, to X. Taro was shown an image of a signed copy of the Nier Reincarnation OST being sold on Vinted, a site typically used for more noble purposes, like reselling clothes or old books. Mind, flogging a signed something-or-other isn't inherently scummy (times are tough!) but what isn't great is faking the signature entirely. \"This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine,\" Taro says, before adding that \"I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.\" Oof. This has naturally led to a flurry of people asking whether or not their autographs are genuine, or sharing genuine ones—which sort of defeats the point, though I imagine ol' Taro switches it up from time to time.

Though the 8BitDo Retro R8 owes arguably both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses to that commitment. The version I have my hands on is the N edition. Based on an old school Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, to you and me), it's covered in a pale, warm-toned grey colouring, punctuated with a smattering of reds and blacks, plus grey on the base. It's perhaps the most interesting-looking mouse I've tested in years, and the same can be said about the translucent green Xbox edition . The second you pick up this mouse, you will feel every one of its singular design choices. The ends are angular, rather than the grooves we've come to expect from most mice, and the left and right side-buttons are recessed into the frame of the mouse itself. That means you have to get leverage over the opposite side of the mouse to get enough space to jam your finger in. These side buttons …",

It's a platformer focused on fluid, momentum-based motion through stylish one-screen levels, and I can't recommend it enough: nothing else feels like this game. In my 92/100 review I practiced no restraint at all. \"In some ways N++ feels like the end of the action platformer,\" I wrote, \"like an exhaustive final document, a catalogue of its emotional highs and lows.\" I stand by those words mostly because, ten years later, I still play N++ occasionally. There's nothing else that scratches the same itch. And with over 4,000 levels—not including user-made levels—It's so big that I doubt I'll ever finish it. But that doesn't mean I'm not excited for Ten++, which is a sizeable new update adding even more levels I doubt I'll ever finish. The free update includes new levels for the solo, multiplayer and race modes, as well as six new color schemes and \"a few assorted bugfixes\".

I could talk on and on about how it de-incentivises toxicity, has some really neat boss and class designs, and a progression system that constantly rewards you instead of de-levelling your key and taking your lunch money. And I might. But the thing I'm really impressed by is one tiny little UI feature that solves a problem that's been plaguing World of Warcraft (and other MMOs) for years. Decades, even. See, in MMOs, a secondary responsibility for damage dealers—other than blasting—is interrupting enemy spellcasting. Usually, specific abilities need to be interrupted or else the pull of that particular dungeon gets way harder.

The AIO in question looks to be an MSI MPG CoreLiquid P13 360 , and yes, that cooler does actually let you use the screen as an extended display rather than just importing gifs or video files to replay on it. Which means this very likely is Battlefield 6 (BF6) actually playing on the little screen, rather than a streamed video or moving image. It doesn't look like the game's all too playable on the round screen, though—half of the HUD is cut off. Our Jacob Ridley discovered this HUD-chopping effect himself when he tried the cooler's hand at playing Doom in-browser.

The same is true in gaming; how many times have you slapped your mouse down in frustration because you're sure it's just cost you the win in Counter Strike or Valorant? Well, let's take the tools out of the equation and look at what the leading esports players are using themselves. Of course, using the same gear as Faker isn't going to suddenly make you too a four-times League of Legends World Champion, but at the very least if you're matching the gaming setups that the professionals use you can't use that as an excuse. You're just going to have to use them to git gud. I've picked out three of the main categories of esports, FPS (Valorant, CS2, Fornite), MOBA (League of Legends, DOTA 2), and sports (Rocket League, FC25), and picked the most popular gaming mouse, gaming keyboard, and gaming headset from what the highest proportion of professional gamers use. It is worth noting that sponsorship and platform plays a big part of this, where Logitech sponsors a lot of the MOBA pros and the PS5 is the de facto platform for something like FC25, so the DualSense is the automatic choice for the pros. So, keep that in mind... …",

They give you that extra hundredth of a second to catch the drift. You don't realise how important that leeway is, until you play a game that doesn't give it to you. Welcome to Assetto Corsa Rally. While Kunos Simulazioni is still busy building its Gran Turismo-style omni-simulator Assetto Corsa Evo, the Roman Studio has embarked on a technical partnership with compatriots Supernova Games Studios to bring the most authentic—and demanding—rally sim to PC since the venerable Richard Burns Rally. Kunos handed over the vehicle handling physics and other technical data, then Supernova gave a stoic nod, loaded up Unreal Engine 5, and promptly set to work building a game that will ruthlessly dissolve any ego you had about being handy in the gravel. Although it's the work of a separate studio, it's funny how distinctly 'Assetto Corsa' this project looks and feels. There's a distinctive crispness and clarity to t…",

According to AP News , a post from the Ministry of State Security on WeChat accused the US National Security Agency (NSA) of exploiting vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a mobile phone brand to steal information from National Time Center employees back in 2022. Since then, the ministry says that the NSA used 42 types of \"special cyberattack weapons\" to disrupt the internal network systems, and attempted to infiltrate a key timing system between 2023 and 2024—although no evidence was provided in the post to backup these claims. \"The U.S. is accusing others of what it does itself,\" the post continues. \"Repeatedly hyping up claims about Chinese cyber threats.\" After discovering the breach, the min…",

Arc Raiders pulled in a peak concurrent player count of 189,668. That makes it Steam's 89th most-played game by concurrent players, per the keepers of the scrolls over at SteamDB . It's ahead of GTA 5 Enhanced, Dune: Awakening, and Football Manager 2020, and just a hair off the personal records of Warframe and Stellar Blade. It's worth nothing that the game hit its peak pretty early in the server test, mind you. Right as things picked up, we brought you news that the game had slipped just part 185,000 players. The mathletes among you will note that 189,668 isn't too much more than that, and indeed the game reached that peak on the first day of the Server Slam.

It's a list designed to represent the passion of our global team of over 30 writers and editors. If you're wondering why Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire is back on the list for the first time in years, it's because Josh made a fully animated powerpoint presentation that he delivered to the team while dressed up as a pirate. Not everyone went to those lengths to advocate for their chosen favourites, but you can be sure every pick is a game that at least a few people on staff care deeply about. As always, the key question when creating a list of the best games is: What does it mean to be the 'best'? Is it a canon classic—a game that can't be ignored for its legacy to all of PC gaming? Is it an original idea, offering up something that's never been seen before? Or, more simply, is it a finely crafted masterpiece—the pinnacle of its chosen genre?

The momentous news came, appropriately enough, alongside a shot of Liu and his own sleepy dog, though the shot of the script itself had the writer's name cunningly edited out. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride for this project, based on—if you've somehow forgotten—2012's open world crime game of the year. The film was originally announced back in 2017, with Donnie Yen set to star. Then things went quiet until Yen himself said it had been canned earlier this year. That's when Liu entered to take up the banner. The rights to Sleeping Dogs belong to the game's publisher, Square Enix. You might reasonably think, with Square Enix being kind of weird about its properties in general, that it might bear some responsibility for the movie's rocky road so far.
