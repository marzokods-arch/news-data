In a new interview with IGN , creator Eric Barone listed a handful of features coming in the update, and one of them answers an oft-made demand from Stardew Valley die-hards: make kids interesting. Stardew Valley kids—ie, the children you raise yourself, not the diminutive NPCs roaming around town— are very boring. They just walk around your house and don't do much else. They don't grow, and they have few demands. They're quite unlike real children. \"What I will say without maybe being too specific is that with this update, one of the things we're trying to do is... Well, there is a popular fan request, which has to do with the children, trying to make the children a little more interesting,\" Barone said. \"So I'm trying to do something with that, but there's a lot of other things in the update as well that no one's really asked for, but I think people will appreciate it.\" Another confirmed new feature is two new marriage candidates.

Pahdo Labs laid off half its team, halted updates, and said it was going \"back to the drawing board\", with a follow-up announcement promised for February. Now that follow-up has arrived, and it's more bad news. CEO Dan Zou has announced the studio is shutting down completely. \"Since our last update in November, we've been grappling with the reality that Starlight Re:Volver did not achieve the commercial success we needed to sustain Pahdo Labs. We aimed high, spread ourselves too thin, and shipped a game that couldn't hold a healthy player base.\" Zou revealed that Pahdo spent the last few months working on a demo for a game in a similar style called Edge of Divinity, hoping to attract a new round of investors. \"We believed making a demo of a familiar but new game would be our best shot,\" Zou wrote, \"as it allowed us to demonstrate lessons learned in game design and market positioning in the quickest and clearest way possible.

Maybe a Fallout 3 remaster! Heck, maybe a Fallout: New Vegas remaster! You've got to admire the optimism, but the finale of Fallout Season 2 is out and the countdown has expired. I'd say it's not all that surprising, but the icon that was revealed isn't an announcement of a new Fallout remaster, it's another explorable node that gives you a 3D walkthrough of one of the show's locations (the penthouse suite in the Lucky 38 casino) with some behind the scenes info and photos. Not that that's a bad thing! If you're a fan of the show, you might like to learn more about it, see photos from the shoot, and learn some trivia. But if you were hoping for something more, like a remaster of a Fallout game, you're probably going to come away disappointed. Here's what it looks like: (Image credit: Prime Video) So, yeah. Like everything else on the map, it's an interactive toy with stuff to click. But who knows? Maybe tucked away somewhere …",

With Fallout Season 1 set in California, like the original Fallout game, and Fallout Season 2 set in Nevada, like Fallout: New Vegas, I was sort of expecting Fallout Season 3 to take place in another region we've visited before in the games. Would it be Fallout 3's Washington D.C.? Maybe Fallout 4's Boston? Well, that could still happen, I suppose, but the finale of Fallout Season 2 suggests a few characters would remain in New Vegas, while another would be visiting somewhere new in Fallout Season 3—and it's a place no Fallout game has ever been set. In the closing moments of the final episode of Fallout Season 2, The Ghoul finally reaches the end of his main quest… except it's not the end. He discovers that his missing family are not inside their designated cryotubes in New Vegas after all, a major bummer after he spent 200 years searching for them. On the bright side, he now knows they're alive, and his wife Barbara has left him a clue as to where they are: he finds a postcard from Colorado in her cryotube. The season ends (except for an intriguing post-credits sequence with another clue about Fallout Season 3) with The Ghoul wal…",

But wait a minute… wasn't there another war in the works? A different war than the one approaching New Vegas? What's happening with that? Earlier in the season, Maximus seemingly kicked off a war between the various Brotherhood of Steel factions by bashing Paladin Xander Harkness in the head with a super sledge to stop him from slaughtering a bunch of ghoul children. It was the very thing elder cleric Quintus had warned him about, because if Harkness was killed it would touch off a civil war between the powerful Commonwealth BOS (where Harkness was from) and the weaker west coast BOS factions. We've heard nothing about that situation since the fourth episode of Fallout Season 2, and it's not revisited in the season finale……",

Alas, the final episode of Fallout Season 2 , \"The Strip\", is another short one, clocking in at about 46 minutes, and it does more table-setting for Season 3 than wrapping up of Season 2.

I was most interested in his comments on why Disco Elysium, which bucks CRPG tradition in so many ways, follows genre convention in having a top-down isometric perspective. \"The isometric image is wonderful in that it is flat,\" Rostov says. \"There's none of this 3D, like a million viewpoints. It's just this one image, in essence. You can design the entire game as if it was a painting.

It's armed with a \"heavy coaxial machinegun\" and a \"120mm high-velocity cannon.\" To put that firepower in perspective: 120mm explosive rounds are the same ordinance that Super Destroyers drop in 120mm missile barrages.

It was more like: ‘That sucks. What are we learning?’\" The disappointing results—and the success of Grounded 2—have led Obsidian to \"think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take.\" Urquhart wants Obsidian to make games in three to four year cycles. \"We don’t need to change everything every time,\" he said. \"We’ve had this debate internally: Do people really care that we spent an extra hundre…",

As the resident homemaker of my friend group, I'm always back at the base managing NPCs, living arrangements, and our chaotic infrastructure. So when my friends returned with scads of 'magically delicious' greens and no idea where they picked them up, I had to figure out how to get a Lucky Clover in Terraria and decide if it was trash or treasure.

But Highguard's marquee Raid mode is genuinely unlike any other FPS mode out there, at least in the sense that nobody has ever constructed this particular FPS sandwich before: Two slices of Rainbow Six with a battle royale center. I also appreciate that it's a free-to-play shooter that doesn't bombard players with ads (at least for now) or sell battle passes that expire.

That's a tricky thing to navigate when determining value here, as nothing is as good value as it was five months ago, but I have generally little bad to say about the Element Pro. It's solid. Starting with its choice of components, it comes with an Asus Prime RX 9070 XT 16 GB, which isn't far off the choice of graphics card I'd choose for a PC build of my own right now. It's capable at 4K and has 16 GB of VRAM. That alone is sure to make some gamers swoon. Though you don't get to switch on DLSS, FSR is a decent alternative. And the Prime card, including a triple-fan shroud, is pretty cool and quiet—reaching a mere 61 °C in my testing in Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition. The CPU is the tremendous Ryzen 7 7800X3D , which was once upon a time the best CPU for gaming .

Among the topics Nesmith addresses is why it wouldn't make sense to switch to Unreal Engine , and how studio head Todd Howard is an inveterate fiddler, even if he \"desperately\" tries not to be. Nesmith has some pretty firm beliefs about decisions that have been made about the hugely popular Elder Scrolls series over time, at least one of which had my esteemed colleague Joshua Wolens despairing (it's a lore thing). He's asked about the idea of lowering barriers to entry for new players within the series, and whether it's a trend he expects to see continue with The Elder Scrolls 6. \"Absolutely, and I led the charge on that, to be frank,\" says Nesmith. \"Obviously I had to persuade Todd, as he is the ultimate arbiter on these things, but I managed to do so. I did a lot of the character systems and one of Todd's philosophies early on in Oblivion, which I took to heart and why I pushed so hard for these things, is that he wanted an interfaceless game so ideally you just play the game. You just play it.\" Hmm. I mean, as a philosophy fair enough… but…",

Those affected have taken to social media to voice their frustrations, and advise others how to move to different AI models. It's Anthropic's model, Claude, that's getting the nod more often than not.

It experimented with a 5v5 raid mode over the weekend , but maintained that it wasn't meant to be a replacement for its standard 3v3 mode.

Fallout season 2 episode 8 premieres on February 3, 2026 and it's starting a few hours earlier than most of the other episodes of the season so you'll actually be able to press play that night instead of waiting until after work on Wednesday—neato! When is the Fallout season 2 episode 8 release time? Fallout season 2 episode 8 premieres on Tuesday, February 3 at 6 pm Pacific on Prime Video. Here's when that is in other time zones around the world: 6 pm PST, February 3 (Los Angeles) 9 pm EDT, February 3 (New York) 2 am GMT, February 4 (London) 3 am CEST, February 4 (Berlin) 1 pm AEDT, February 4 (Sydney) 3 pm NZDT, February 4 (Auckland) You've got just enough time before that to brush up on the other details about Fallout Season 2 , particularly our Fallout season 2 episode 7 recap in which Lucy wrestles with free will versus evil and The Ghoul learns the consequences of ineffectual good intentions.

In a chat with PressBoxPR , Nesmith said \"the big one\" in terms of lore regrets \"would be the time splitting thing that happened way back in the Daggerfall days.\" That'd be the Dragon Break , a name you may dimly recall from the book Where Were You When The Dragon Broke? that you can…",

One thing that has bothered me, however, is the limit to two houses per account—one per faction. I'm a roleplayer, which means I have a lot of characters with different themes who might want different homes—and aside from building an apartment complex (which, hey, it's possible) I'm left without much in the way of abilities to do that.

Ars Technica's reporting focusses, inevitably, on TVs. But where TVs go, the PC monitor market often follows. See 1080p and 4K resolutions for proof. Of course, TV and monitor formats and resolutions are not all exactly the same. See 1440p and ultrawide monitors for proof, equally, of that. Ars points out that the first 8K TV was announced by Sharp way back in 2012, with the first 8K OLED being released by LG in 2019. But wider adoption has been slow. While there are now, by the estimates of data firm Omdia, around one billion 4K TVs out there, only 1.6 million 8K TVs have found homes since 2015. Indeed, what little 8K TV sales there have been peaked in 2022. Consequently, the likes of LG and Sony are entirely exiting the 8K market .

It uses a microphone built into the earcup that's taking aim at your mouth, and using AI-powered denoising to keep non-mouth sounds away from the feed. I've experimented with beamforming microphones before. Both on the Bang & Olufsen Portal and Audeze Maxwell —with the former being my go-to headphones for a long while now. Admittedly, the beamforming microphone on both is weaker than your average boom arm, and by some margin, but perhaps noise cancelling will come to the rescue here.

    "body": "Competitive gaming gear often isn't all that exciting. That's because, like the ill-fated switch to Dvorak or Colemak (if you had to Google that, it proves my point), players get used to a certain standard. You can't push the boat out too much or overcommit to a single selling point. Most competitive players simply want something that functions as they're used to, but better. That's why I was a little surprised to see competitive players as the target audience for Be Quiet!'s first foray into the gaming peripherals market. Unlike the Be Quiet! Light Mount and its wonderful dampened keys, the Dark Perk Ergo and Dark Perk Sym don't have noticeable gimmicks—they miss a USP. I can, however, say that the Dark Perk Ergo is clearly very well built. Despite holes in the bottom to cut down on weight, it's not flimsy. I can apply a lot of pressure on the side (be it for fun or because I've lost a round), and it doesn't move an inch. At 55 g, it's certainly on the lighter side, but Be Quiet!'s material choice is a good one, giving a mouse that could take a drop or jostle without a problem. The Ergo model is clearly a right-handed design, with its side buttons being on the left and a slight c…",

During the TWT Finals over the weekend, we were treated to a trailer for Season 3 which seemed desperate to tell us one thing: Tekken 8 is going back to basics, promise. It literally says that in the trailer, too: Season 3 goes back to basics. Refined balance. More conventional. More focused. More deliberate. A fresh start. It's a lot more straightforward and communicative than Season 2, which is certainly a good place to start. It's also exactly the kind of stuff players have been wanting to hear for the best part of a year. Hell, maybe even two. But how that philosophy will manifest itself remains to be seen.

One was its clever finetuning of survival and building systems that still felt really clunky in competing games, and which many have since adopted. The other thing was Vikings. Valheim ruled so much that it was our favourite game of 2021 , and that was largely thanks to Vikings. Five years later Valheim is still in early access, but its updates come thick and fast and its community seems, by and large, pretty happy with how things are going. To celebrate the milestone, Iron Gate has issued a special anniversary update, or \"Patch 0.221.10\" in more prosaic terms. It features a bunch of nice things, like \"a celebratory hat\", a new weapon in the form of early axes (they're basically ancient dual-wieldable axes), and frosted sweetbread, which is a new consumable.

If you're grabbing all six Divinity games together, it'll only cost you $23 for 17 years and hundreds of hours of RPG from the studio that made Baldur's Gate 3. Just don't grab the Divinity: Original Sin 2: Eternal Edition pack, also on Steam. For some reason, that's only been marked down 60%, or $10 more for only five of the series' six games⁠—the furtive Dragon Commander, so easily forgotten… 23 bucks feels like a steal for Original Sin 2 alone. Our 2017 game of the year remains a fresh, surprising RPG almost a full decade after launch. And don't believe the haters : Its magic/physical armor system is actually brilliant , and it's an incalculable loss for all mankind that Larian will not be revisiting it in the upcoming Divinity. That's just \"Divinity\" coming soon, nothing Divine, Beyond, 2, Dragon Commander, Original Sin, or Original Sin 2 about it. As for how to tackle this bottomless brunch buffet of RPG, we have a full guide to the series and how we recommend approaching it. For the TL,DR: Go in more or less reverse order of release until you stop having fun, but ski…",

So, wouldn't it make sense for Bethesda to make lightning strike twice? People love Skyrim even more than Fallout, so shouldn't Bethesda try to turn The Elder Scrolls into a TV series, too? Maybe not! Bruce Nesmith, lead designer on Skyrim, doesn't think so, anyway. In an interview with PressboxPR , Nesmith, who left Bethesda in 2021 during the development of Starfield, laid out the reasons it wouldn't make sense for Bethesda to try to duplicate what it's done with the Fallout show. \"What you have to realize about things like the Fallout TV show is that they don't make Bethesda money directly,\" Nesmith said. \"I would be shocked if Bethesda is making any money that they care about really, not when you make literally billions of dollars on Skyrim. What you're going to make by licensing the IP to this TV show is just peanuts.\" If the Fallout show isn't making Bethesda money, what is it doing? \"What it gets you is notoriety. It's marketing.

Not for much longer, though: Adobe announced today that Animate will soon be removed from sale, with support and access to the software ending over the next few years. According to an FAQ , Adobe Animate will no longer be available to purchase (it's actually a monthly subscription) starting March 1. After that, existing enterprise customers will be able to access the software and receive technical support until March 1, 2029, while customers with individual licenses only have until March 1, 2027 to keep using Adobe Animate. It may not be as popular as it was in the heyday of Newgrounds , but Adobe Animate is still used to make new shows, such as Star Trek: Lower Decks, as well as videogames. The animations for Mewgenics , the latest game from important Flash game designers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, were made in Adobe Animate. It's easy to tell: The Flash vector animation tools impart a distinctive look that defined the aesthetic of web games throughout the late '90s and 2000s. \"It cannot be overstated, fuck Adobe,\" said …",
