The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta. In a recent interview with IGN , console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said changes are coming in the final game. \"We definitely reduced the range and overall reduced the power,\" Nickerson said. \"We found out a lot in open beta that it was obviously very strong, just like players said. Really, players ended up just shooting Doritos. Light environments, dark environments—they were just like, ‘Hey, aim at the Dorito. You're going to hit something at the end of the day.’\" I wish that were hyperbole, but I'd guesstimate that a fourth of my kills in the open beta were enemies I never actually saw.

The studio stands accused of taking a very cool new armor set, which had been intended to be a reward from the returning Iron Banner activity, and instead placing it inside the Eververse Store where it sells for 1,500 Silver per character—$15 in real money. The shambles goes back to September 9, when the Destiny 2 team announced the return of the Iron Banner PvP mode, \"with new weapons to earn and an incredibly cool new set of armor .\" A couple days later, though, Bungie unveiled the new Iron Banner armor and it was in fact \"reprised\" armor , which is to say a reskin of old armor—and not an especially impressive one in the eyes of Destiny 2 fashionistas. The disappointing walkback from \"incredibly cool\" to old hand-me-down was a bummer for players looking for new drip. The real trouble, though, began when concept artist …",

(Well, except for a lone IGN commenter who says, \"So BF6 is mainly a console game now? Gross.\") How far we've come! And in context, it does sound like the Battlefield 6 devs aim to correct an imbalance, not to disregard the PC version. \"We don't want to, obviously, tear down or destroy any of the legacy that Battlefield has, which is, first, a PC game,\" said senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson, who revealed in the interview that he coined the \"secretly console first\" saying at Ripple Effect. \"But we really have to care about console at the end of the day.\" Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl offered a similar take. \"Obviously, we're still also thinking about PC players, but in the past, frankly, Battlefield was built as a PC game and then…",

Developers do what they can to prevent leaks, but sometimes there's just no getting around it. Such is the case with Battlefield 6: Technical director Christian Buhl told IGN that Ripple Effect ( formerly DICE LA ) \"did not want leaks,\" but it did want as much feedback from players as possible—and that meant rolling the dice. \"We had, actually, discussions, I think about a year or two ago,\" Buhl said. \"I guess it was maybe about two years ago, about how much we were going to do to prevent leaks versus how much we were going to do to get the game in front of players. We made a very deliberate decision that we were going to bias very heavily towards putting things in front of players and getting their feedback, even though we knew things would leak.\" Sure enough, that's exactly what happened: The Battlefield Labs program is technically a closed testing platform…",

We are a gritty, grounded, realistic shooter. That's what we intend to be, and that's what the game is going to look like for a while.\" The \"for a while\" bit does give me pause—it would be the unconventional choice for an FPS that plans to sell loads of cosmetics to forever resist crossover opportunities in the name of aesthetics, and I don't exactly trust EA to leave money on the table.

The Dune: Awakening DLC, which costs $12.99, was listed as containing a new storyline, vehicle, cosmetics, and \"the Dune Man building set, letting you build bases in the style of those pragmatic and weathered workers of Arrakis.\" But that \"building set\" turns out to be just four new building pieces, which I think anyone would agree hardly qualifies as a set. Players quickly complained, and Funcom issued a response the following day. \"We realize that our communication around the contents of the DLC has not been clear enough,\" Funcom said . \"The Lost Harvest DLC has a variety of content, with the focus being on the new side story and the Treadwheel, but the way the Dune Man building pieces were communicated created expectations that it would be a full building set rather than what was our intention: four new pieces to supplement the base game…",

They then promptly tell on themselves across social media, asking 'Why did this happen?'\" For the uninitiated, Ricochet has some fun elements to how it works. Many cheaters are just banned on detection, but a lucky few get to play on while Ricochet nerfs their ability \"to do any damage with weapons and vehicles\", tracks them, learns about their behaviour, and then permabans them from all Activision games. The post goes on to detail some of the areas that Activision has recently been targeting, including permabans on accounts that were used to boost others, and regular leaderboard purges in Black Ops 6 and Warzone.

This is an incredible day. It's morning in the Zone. If it's been a while since you fired up CoP, those are the slots—bound to F1, F2, F3, and F4—that let you quickly use items in your inventory without having to pull up the whole equipment screen and laboriously sift through everything you're carrying. By default, they're set to use stuff like medkits, bandages, food, but you can drag whatever you like in there.

To help matters (or make things worse, depending on your point of view), 2K produced a detailed chart of what settings Nvidia GPU owners should use to get the best performance. However, most of this just involved enabling upscaling and frame generation. Borderlands 4 is just plain hard on your hardware. Especially the CPU, it would seem, because the minimum system requirements demand an '8 core (or equivalent)' processor, citing an Intel Core i7 9700 as an example. Yesterday, I tested a very similar chip , the 9700K, in a rig with a Radeon RX 5700 XT and 1080p Low quality, and the CPU was frequently hitting 100% utilisation in the open world (see below).

Yesterday, a coworker shared a link to a little browser game that looked right up PC Gamer's alley: Doomscroll , a top-down shooter played entirely with a scroll wheel. You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay. It was kinda fun: I played a few runs, unlocked some upgrades, and experienced brief whiplash after locking eyes with two headlines about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real. So naturally, I turned to vibe coding for this,\" Friedman wrote. Friedman goes on to describe his process of telling the chatbot…",

Which means a billion guns, gorgeous looks, and some questionable humor. Kotaku has already noticed one joke , however, that seems like a straight-up dig at Embracer Group, former owners of Gearbox. One early game location is called \"Embracer's Bluff\", a run-down place crammed with garbage and containing two rather pointed side quests. The first involves a murderous vending machine that kills a would-be customer, while the second is centred on a talking AI-powered toilet that everyone hates. The cherry on top is the ruler of Embracer's Bluff, who seemingly lives in a hot tub surrounded by dildos. This would be a clear enough dig at Embracer Group, but Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford basically said in the runup to release that Borderlands 4's story was in some ways inspired by the company's acquisition by the Embracer Group, and subsequent r…",

To be honest, it's probably still a reasonably decent CPU in many scenarios, but you can't deny that this sort of rebranding makes things even more complicated for your average user trying to decide on their next upgrade. That's not to mention that the Core i5 110 is an LGA 1200 socket chip, which is a whole two generations behind.

Like 100% good.\" Cain has a pretty clear idea of what \"100% good\" means, saying that they'd spend their time \"growing food and making shelters and looking for old tech and maybe looking for old medicine, and they're really trying to help people.\" As to why he wants to see this, it's not (just) because he's an old softy, but because he thinks it'd be interesting to see how players approached them.

Capcom eventually agreed to let GOG re-release Dino Crisis and the first three Resident Evils, though it took \"time, persistence, and trust-building,\" Gnyp says.

Because of this, Gearbox made the baffling decision to remove the traditional minimap in favour of a compass at the top of the screen. Sure, the compass is useful for getting your bearings, but it's also completely useless in pinpointing enemies in combat. There's a psycho to your northeast, but they could be standing right in front of you or ten blocks away. See what I mean? Luckily, tucked away at the bottom of the 'gameplay' tab in the settings menu is the radar display . This isn't quite the minimap of old, which would give you the exact layout of the area, but it will help you track the exact location of enemies in combat relative to your own position.

There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players. It was all a bit (or a lot) overblown, as PC Gamer's Tyler Colp pointed out: \"a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything.\" Those review bombings did indeed have little impact…",

Post-launch patches solve most of the issues in time, but stutters, hitches, and relatively low frame rates are the norm for the series, so my expectations for Borderlands 4's launch performance weren't very high. And sure enough, it needs work. I've tested Borderlands 4 on two gaming PCs: one that just meets the minimum system requirements ( Core i7 9700K , Radeon RX 5700 XT , 16 GB DDR4-3200) and one that's a top–end gaming rig ( Ryzen 7 9800X3D , GeForce RTX 5090 , 32 GB DDR5-6000). Note: Not long after Borderlands 4 launched on Steam, a 2.7 GB patch appeared. It didn't come with any patch notes, so I have no idea what it fixed or added, but I can say that it stopped most of the crash-to-desktop failures I experienced with my first few runs. Most .

Those are just a couple of the reasons some gamers have chosen to reject launch day hype in favor of \"patient gaming\": Waiting a year or more to play new games, which means getting them cheaper during a sale and playing them after a bunch of big performance and quality-of-life patches have likely made them much better than they were at launch. There's even a pretty active subreddit dedicated to the idea : the main rule is that you're not allowed to post about games that are under a year old. But there's also a reason HBO's servers sometimes struggled with Sunday night demand at the height of Game of Thrones' popularity.

Then there's the actual matches, swarmed with statistics, and the players themselves, whose performances are broken down Moneyball-style. But well before Moneyball grew notoriety, videogames had been reducing sports to their starkest numbers: and in 1992, developers Paul and Oliver Collyer released their calculating, statistic-obsessed vision of the beautiful game. The first Championship Manager wasn't a hit, but it wasn't a flop either, and follow-up Championship Manager 93 made several improvements. The Collyer brothers founded Sports Interactive in July 1994, to develop and manage what was becoming a (relative) sales success, but the game had one core piece of magic. The design of Championship Manager—the focus on statistics, the simple-if-elegant visual style, and the authentic link …",

Oddly enough, Harlowe feels the most like the traditional Siren we've come to know, more so than the best Vex builds , despite her reliance on tech. Nevertheless, the Gravitar brings much more to the table than you'd initially expect, so I'll go over three of the best Harlowe builds at max level below. I'll cover the skills, augments, and capstones to pick, alongside gear that works with them to make this character shine. Best Harlowe builds in Borderlands 4 Harlowe has three unique skill trees, each with their own associated action skill, just like the other Vault Hunters in Borderlands 4: Creative Bursts : Focuses on Harlowe's Chroma Accellerator, dealing elemental damage, causing status effects, and action skill spamming.

Unfortunately, you're restrained by how many skill points you can earn, which is based on the current max level , so you can't splash the cash and unlock every power. Below, I'll go over the max level in Borderlands 4 and how many skill points you can expect to earn right now, so you can properly plan out your characters ' builds. However, I'll also discuss whether we can expect this to increase in the future. What is the max level in Borderlands 4? The max level in Borderlands 4 is 50 , giving you a total of 49 skill points to spend across your three skill trees. Every five skill points you spend unlocks the next layer of the skill tree, apart from the final tier, which requires an extra point to get the final perk. In other words, you could almost reach the end of two skill trees if you're being efficient, though that's not really optimal for most builds. There are a few key features related to your progression: You'll start encountering loot drops with Firmware as early as level 25 (these are effectively gear sets).
