I'll explain the Bird City map modifier below, including everything it adds and how it benefits you, as well as the schedule in your timezone. Take note that this is only a minor map modifier, similar to Lush Blooms, so it simply takes over the standard matchmaking for the Buried City map; it's not a separate node like Night Raid, for example. When is the next Bird City event in Arc Raiders? (Image credit: Embark) Like other map modifiers, Bird City is active multiple times per day at specific intervals (every eight hours) and lasts for just one hour. This gives you a very narrow window for when you can play it.

And now, it's even going as far as to characterise itself as helping build a \"rebel alliance\" against Big Tech.

However, according to Bleeping Computer , Microsoft now says that the update-based failure seems to be linked to a previous security update bug. Per a Microsoft business account-locked advisory spotted by an AskWoody forum member : \"Recent investigations have determined this issue can occur on devices that failed to install the December 2025 security update and were left in an improper state after rolling back the update. \"Attempting to install Windows updates while in this improper state could result in the device being unable to boot.

And by wearing the same thing, I mean all playing as the exact same guy with no way of knowing who's who.

A single moment in this week's episode , where a sick suit of NCR power armor was unveiled alongside the stirring Fallout theme, had me itching mightily to reinstall a Fallout game—any Fallout game, really—for a fresh playthrough. If you feel the same, it sounds like a great time to dive into Fallout 76 because it's completely free to play from now until February 5, which will carry you through to the Fallout Season 2 finale next week. If you want to wear that dope NCR power armor from the show in Fallout 76, though—that ain't free. That ain't even close to free. The Fallout 76 Mojave Bundle , which includes that tasty NCR armor skin, a Legion Legate outfit, an NCR flag and neon New Vegas sign, a fancy lookin' new super sledge, and a few other odds and ends, will run you $30 USD. That's pretty steep, especially considering everything else Fallout related is on sale on Steam at the moment. You can actually buy Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4 for a total of $17.50, or two months of Fallout 1st (which gets you a private world and a monthly allowance of in…",

This hasn't changed much since 2021 , when GDC reported that 31% of devs use generative AI, but how they feel about it has dramatically shifted. This year, 52% of the more than 2,300 respondents said that they \"think generative AI is having a negative impact on the game industry,\" according to the report's author, Beth Elderkin, who notes that just 18% said the same thing two years ago, and 30% last year. The opposite opinion, that generative AI is good for the industry, was only found in 7% of this year's respondents, a decline from 13% last year. The people least likely to approve of generative AI are who you'd expect: artists, designers, writers, and programmers. The people who use AI the most are also who you'd expect. Ever since CEOs started hyping the technology as a productivity elixir, skeptics have suspected that the executive class is more likely to personally rely on chatbots, and GDC's survey results are consistent with that hypothesis. \"Business professionals' usage (58%) far out…",

Some countries over the past year have issued travel advisories or cautions for people headed to the US: Canada, for instance, issued a warning in 2025 that anyone with a gender-neutral passport could face difficulty entering the country because of an executive order signed by Trump directing the government to recognize only two \"sexes,\" male and female. The US is also home to a large number of developer conferences and events, and that leaves developers with a tough choice: Put themselves at risk of detention or worse, or miss out on potentially vital opportunities for networking and promotion, which can be particularly important for smaller indie devs. Despite the high cost missing these events can incur, GDC's 2026 State of the Game Industry survey indicates that nearly one-third of industry employees who don't live in the US have cance…",

That percentage was even higher in the United States, where 33% of respondents said they'd been laid off during the same period. 17% of surveyed games industry workers reported having been laid off in just the last 12 months, while half of respondents said their current or most recent employer had conducted layoffs in the last year. The survey results indicate that widespread layoffs remain a persistent issue in the games industry, having intensified during the transition into the post-pandemic era and the fallout of industry expansion and acquisition. More than 16,000 games industry workers lost their jobs between January 2023 and January 2024. 2025 offered little reassurance that the losses would stabilize as job cuts continued at major companies like Microsoft, which dramatically downsized its gaming division while laying off…",

We only get one shot at this,\" a goggled Sam Fisher says in a recognizably Metal Gear Solid call screen. We then see a neck-down shot of Solid Snake skulking through a cloud of smoke, unholstering what appears to be a SOCOM pistol with an unusual sight. The man himself doesn't speak, but he appears to be wearing a sneaking suit similar to this MGS2 look. The teaser ends with the date and time of the full Year 11 roadmap reveal: February 15 at 8AM PT. Some obvious questions arise, such as: Huh? Collaborations are nothing new for Rainbow Six where cosmetics are concerned, but this is the first time a playable operator has come from outside the Tom Clancyverse.

The existing game will be renamed to Final Fantasy 7 - 2013 Edition when the new version launches. Existing owners will have access to both versions, but the original will no longer be available for purchase.

And across all runs, there will now be corrupted regions on the map that you can choose to pass through, facing harder enemies but earning stronger rewards in the process.

I stumbled across Little Woody after playing one too many Arc Raiders matches. With a free demo currently available, I thought there was no harm in checking out this 2D point-and-click puzzle game and having a change in pace. The only reason I was wrong in thinking this is actually because I enjoyed it too much, and suddenly reaching the end of the demo enraged me more than a backstab in Arc Raiders could—I was just starting to get into the puzzle-solving groove.

Instead, I would just let it tally up exercise based on physical exertion. So, if I slacked, I wouldn't finish. To establish some ground rules, I decided this would not be a replacement for traditional exercise, and traditional exercise would not be a replacement for it.

It comes in the form of the Open Gaming Collective (OGC) , a group formed, at least in part, of developers for various and somewhat disparate gaming-oriented Linux distros. Developers of these distros, such as those working on Bazzite, Nobara, Asus Linux, PikaOS, and many more, will work together to \"a unified set of gaming-focused components used across the Linux ecosystem\" (via GamingOnLinux ). The various distros represented aren't all built on the same base OS, either; Nobara and Bazzite, for instance, are Fedora-based, while PikaOS is Debian-based, and ChimeraOS is Arch-based. Ubuntu, the most popular and well-known Linux distribution, is Debian-based, but Fedora tends to be a popular base for gaming distros, and Arch is what the Steam Deck's SteamOS is bui…",

After spending a week with a pre-release build of Destiny of the Railforged , my enthusiasm is renewed. Though the DLC doesn't touch every aspect of Monster Train 2 (there are no new Alcove events, for example), it's a substantial package that makes an already large experience feel supersized.

Microsoft also says in its earnings release that Xbox content and services revenue, including Game Pass, were down by 5%.

That obviously makes it difficult to gauge the impact of the Game Pass Ultimate price hike , which wasn't exactly warmly received by gamers.
