Samsung usually leans heavily on trade-ins, especially for its high-end devices. The device is officially going on sale tomorrow, so it looks like you’ll have to fork out the full asking price. At $2,899 plus tax , the Galaxy Z TriFold is already asking a lot. If you were eyeing Samsung’s three-panel foldable and telling yourself you’d claw some of that money back by trading in your current device, you might want to brace yourself. Early signs suggest that the option may not be on the table. As 9to5Google spotted, Samsung briefly put the Galaxy Z TriFold up for sale on its US website earlier today, ahead of its official launch tomorrow. The phone wasn’t available to buy for long, but the listing was revealing. While buyers could see pricing, bundles, and add-ons, the usual trade-in option was conspicuously absent.",

A complaint that earned it countless poor reviews on Google Play, causing great confusion among users and spawning several sketchy forks. That change is the removal of support for .3ds files, which is by far the most common ROM file type for Nintendo 3DS games. The team claimed this was to distance the project from its predecessor’s dubious roots in piracy, but in practice, all you needed to do was change the file extension from .3ds to .cci, and it still worked, provided the files were not encrypted.",

The case hinged on the “conversion” of cellular data purchased from mobile carriers, specifically, which plaintiffs argued is their property. Google will pay out $135 million to affected users and make adjustments to Android behavior and terms of service. Google has agreed to pay $135 million to settle a class action suit over “appropriating” Android users’ mobile data. The suit accused Google of harvesting Android user data over cellular connections without their consent, including at times when Google’s apps were closed on those users’ devices. As reported by Reuters , a preliminary settlement was filed Tuesday night and is pending approval from a judge. Assuming there aren’t any last-minute changes, anyone in the US (outside of California) who’s accessed the internet using a cellular network on an Android device since November 12, 2017 will be eligible to claim part of the settlement.",

It goes further than many novelty ring watches by adding health and fitness tracking. At $49.99, it’s cheap enough to be a weird gift, and even has a “couple interaction mode.” Smart rings have been edging closer to smartwatches for a while now, but Rogbid has taken a more literal approach. The company has just launched the Rogbid Fusion, a device that looks like a smartwatch shrunk down into ring form, complete with a screen, health tracking, and even the option to wear it on your wrist instead. Rogbid isn’t a big name in wearables, but it’s been selling budget smart devices for years. As spotted by The Verge , the Fusion is now available from Rogbid’s online store for $49.99. That’s far cheaper than most ring watches, and it comes in gold, silver, and black finishes.",

It allows you to log in to your Epic Games account to browse and download games on your Android device. Support is still experimental, and multiplayer games are not working. The age of PC emulation on Android is upon us, with new translation layers and software allowing you to play Steam games on your phone or Android gaming handheld without any fuss. Now, for the first time, you’ll also be able to play titles from the Epic Games Store library, thanks to a nightly update from GameNative. And if you’re like me, that amounts to literally hundreds of free games claimed over the years. While support is still experimental, the setup is fairly straightforward. After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration. From there, it will open a browser where you can log in to your Epic Games account. Then, you need to copy an authentication key, paste it into GameNative, and it should automatically populate your game list (give it a minute if you have 500+ games like me).",

Modern implementations have gotten increasingly strong with their conversational skills, and that’s one of the big reasons we were so happy to see Gemini come to Google Maps navigation last fall — you could just focus on your driving, and make casual requests to Gemini for information about points of interest. And now, that’s getting even better. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has released a new update for the Galaxy Watch 4, fixing issues brought by the One UI 8 upgrade last month. Multiple users on Reddit have confirmed that issues with their Galaxy Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic have resolved. The update also brings the January 2026 security update. The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",

Demand for affordable 4G devices remains surprisingly high, as seen in the success of the Galaxy A06 4G, which sold more than any Galaxy S25 series flagship.

Take, for instance, the Galaxy S25 series , which launched globally in January 2025, giving it a strong position to emerge as a global top-seller in 2025.

Global sales start on February 12 at $499 for the 12+256 version, or $599 for the 16+512GB version. The gaming phone landscape is looking pretty grim in 2026, with ASUS stepping back from the smartphone market and newer flagship chips suffering from poor thermal performance. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro is one of the last gaming phones on the market (and our top pick for the best gaming phone ), but now it’s set to get a cheaper, more pocketable sibling. The REDMAGIC 11 Air is a slightly slimmed-down version of the 11 Pro, but not by much. The company writes that it’s “12% thinner and 10% lighter” than its larger sibling, with the same 6.85-inch 144Hz AMOLED panel. It’s still roughly as thick as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra at 8mm, but the flat back means there’s no camera bump to get in your way while you game.",

AYN made two major announcements via Discord this morning, and the news is bittersweet for handheld fans. Starting with the good news, the company is running a sale on the Odin 2 Portal, which remains our pick for the best retro gaming handheld you can buy a year after release. The sale starts now, and it will continue through the Chinese New Year, ending on February 25. The company is framing this as “a token of our appreciation to our users,” but it may also simply be clearing stock. While supplies last, the 8+128GB Base model costs $249 (down from $329), the 12+512GB Pro model costs $369 (down from $399), and the 16GB+1TB Max model costs $449 (down from $499).",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Nothing’s co-founder and CEO Carl Pei has confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship this year. Instead, it will focus on its Phone 4a series and audio products. Pei says the decision is backed by the intensifying competition to acquire smartphone components. The Nothing Phone 3 can be classified as less than a success. While it excelled in terms of fun, quirky features , the Phone 3 did not thrive in terms of practicality or value. Despite its novelty, the non-flagship chipset and an $800 price tag easily made the phone feel impractical . And Nothing appears to have taken the verdict to the heart, to the effect that it is taking 2026 to mull over flagships instead of releasing one. In a recent video shared on the official Nothing YouTube channel, co-founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship phone in 2026. This could be a shocker for Nothing fans, as it seemingly was for the staff member speaking with Pei on the talk show. But coming from the outspoken CEO himself, there’s little room for realignment.",

AI-driven data center demand is pushing chipmakers toward high-margin HBM, driving up DRAM prices and squeezing phone makers. Budget phones under $150 are taking the biggest hit as rising costs make low-end devices harder to sustain. The smartphone industry is facing a paradox. Counterpoint Research reports that global smartphone chipset shipments will drop by 7% in 2026. Normally, fewer shipments would mean trouble for the industry , but this time, manufacturers are still expected to see double-digit revenue growth. So, why are shipments dropping? Part of the reason is the growing demand from data centers . As AI becomes more common, chipmakers are shifting their resources to produce high-margin HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for large server farms. This shift has caused DRAM prices to rise sharply, making it harder for manufacturers to create affordable phones without taking a loss.",

We’ve already seen leaked renders showing off the Galaxy S26 phones , giving us a good idea of what to expect next month. Now, a trusted leaker has posted images showing these phones clad in cases. Veteran leaker Evan Blass has shared renders showing off the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra in UAG cases. He also posted a picture showing an S26 series device (ostensibly the S26 Ultra) with a screen protector. Check out the images below.",

They come equipped with a powerful Samsung ISOCELL HPE sensor (200MP), large batteries (up to 6,580mAh), and fast wired charging (up to 100W). Xiaomi promises four years of Android updates and six years of security patches for these Hyper OS 2 phones. The worsening RAM crisis and resulting price increases have brought mid-range Android phones back into focus, but they also push consumers to demand more from them. Not only are phones expected to be good enough to handle all needs, but they should also be durable enough to withstand everyday wear and tear and the occasional drop. Xiaomi is building on that theme with the launch of the Redmi Note 15 Pro 5G and Redmi Note 15 Pro Plus 5G, promising better durability than ever before in the lineup.

The company says the issue affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under rare conditions. Manual and automatic Call Screen still work, and callers can continue using standard carrier voicemail instead. Most recent Pixel features have been welcome additions, but one meant to handle missed calls has instead caused a bit of a privacy snafu. Over the past few months, some users reported that callers could hear background audio during missed calls, rather than being cleanly prompted to leave a message. Google has now confirmed the issue and says it’s disabling Take a Message on the affected devices. In a post on its support forums , Siri Tejaswini, a Google community manager, said the company investigated the reports and confirmed they affect “a very small subset” of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under “very specific and rare circumstances.” Out of caution, Google is disabling Take a Message and its next-generation Call Screen features on those phones.",

AI-generated images just found a new canvas: your wall. SwitchBot’s latest isn’t a robot or a smart lock. It’s a collection of E Ink picture frames that double as always-on AI art displays. On the hardware side, the frames feature E Ink Spectra 6 technology, designed to mimic the layered look of real paint on real paper. As with other E Ink displays, the result is glare-free, backlight-free, and easy on the eyes, making it better suited as wall art than an LCD or OLED screen. Through the SwitchBot app, users can upload and organize artwork, store up to 10 images locally, sync new content, and schedule images to cycle on and off at given times of day. The frames are available in 7.3-inch, 13.3-inch, and 31.5-inch builds, each of which supports both horizontal and vertical orientations.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 series’s launch pricing may be the same as last year’s S25 series, at least in some markets. This is contrary to earlier reporting that suggested increased RAM prices would lead to higher S26 prices for consumers. The leak in question deals with pricing in Euros, and we can’t be totally sure what it means for US pricing. RAM prices have been soaring in recent months , a trend that’s caused product delays and fueled concern that new consumer electronics of all kinds will see reduced memory, higher sticker prices, or both. It was reported in November that the upcoming Galaxy S26 series was likely to see a RAM-induced price hike versus last year’s S25 phones, but a new leak suggests that might not be the case. Leaker Roland Quandt posted today on Bluesky that pricing for S26 base models will be “pretty much the same” as the S25 at launch, at least in European markets. His post goes on to say that the S26 Ultra may actually be less expensive, coming in about “100 Euro cheaper for 256 and 512GB” models, though he’s expecting the one-terabyte version’s pricing to remain the same.",

Frattare X-ray: NASA/CXC/CfA/Á Bogdán; Infrared: NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI; Image Processing: NASA/CXC/SAO/P. Edmonds and L. Frattare A new discovery captures the cosmic moment when a galaxy cluster – among the largest structures in the universe – started to assemble only about a billion years after the big bang, one or two billion years earlier than previously thought. This result, made using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and James Webb Space Telescope, will lead astronomers to rethink when and how the largest structures in the universe formed. The findings are described in a paper published [Wednesday] in the journal Nature. The object, known as JADES-ID1 for its location in the “JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey” (JADES) has a mass about 20 trillion times that of the Sun. Astronomers classify JADES-ID1 as a “protocluster” because it is currently undergoing an early, violent phase of formation and will one day turn into a galaxy cluster. However, JADES-ID1 is found at a much larger distance – corresponding to a much earlier time in the universe – than astronomers expect…",

My glass-enclosed shower blocks most of the sound coming from my phone; even with the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s louder speaker and the trick of using corners to amplify sound, I couldn’t hear it clearly in the shower.

The ITF has approved various models of the WHOOP tracker for match use so long as haptic feedback is disabled, but Grand Slam events can impose additional rules independently. WHOOP responded by sending its Body apparel collection, which conceals the tracker within undergarments, to players, though using them still risks violating competition regulations. WHOOP makes one of the most interesting fitness trackers around, focusing entirely on strain, recovery, and long-term performance rather than on-wrist features, to the point that it does not even have a display. It’s a niche device that works out well for athletes who want deeper insights into their bodies.

Emulation frontends help keep things nice and organized, but a new app called NeoStation goes above and beyond what traditional frontends like ES DE and Beacon offer, with a plethora of unique features. NeoStation, the brainchild of solo dev Miguel Soto, just hit beta with a slick new UI redesign. After a quick, easy setup (you have to delete the app if you have an older version), it displays all the games on your system, including Android games and apps on mobile devices.",

This could be very useful for many users, but also raises performance concerns due to Chrome’s resource usage. The feature doesn’t seem to be widely available in Chrome Canary yet, but we’re guessing this is a gradual release. Google Chrome is the world’s most popular web browser on PCs, but it also has a reputation for being a resource hog. Now, Google has implemented a toggle that’s convenient in theory, but also means the browser can suck up resources as soon as you start your computer. Chrome expert Leopeva64 reported on Twitter that Chrome Canary now offers an Open Chrome when my computer starts toggle on Windows. The toggle, which is apparently off by default but functional, opens a Chrome window as soon as you boot up your PC. The toggle can be found by tapping Settings &gt; On startup &gt; Open Chrome when my computer starts . Check out a screenshow below, via the tipster.",

Android releases don’t move in a straight line, from ‘under development’ to ‘released’. Multiple versions of the operating system exist at the same time, at different stages of development, and are meant for completely different audiences. What creates confusion is that all of them are discussed simultaneously on online forums. The confusion spirals further when you add Pixel-exclusive features , leaked experiments, and the constant noise enthusiasts create on social media.",

Despite policies against sexual nudity, these apps were distributed through the app stores. Many of the apps generated significant revenue from in-app purchases, of which the platforms take as much as a 30% cut. Many of these apps were removed following the report, but several are still available for download. AI is one of the most powerful tools available these days, and you can do so much with it. But, like any tool, it can be used for good or bad . Over the past few weeks, we’ve witnessed social media users using X’s Grok AI chatbot in lewd ways, primarily to create sexualized imagery of women without their consent. As it turns out, it’s not just Grok that has been at the center of this undressing scandal, as both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store allegedly hosted “nudify” apps.

The Phone 4a Pro gets a subtle increment in the battery, but retains the same 50W charging speed. The other big improvement is the water protection rating, now IP65. Unlike the more premium Phone 3, which largely disappointed with its inflated pricing, Nothing’s Phone 3a and the 3a Pro impressed with their high value proposition and features absent from mid-range phones. Naturally, the successors, Nothing Phone 4a and Phone 4a Pro, have big shoes to fill. We expect the series to come with reasonable upgrades without a significant price increase, and a recent leak proves this assumption may be partially true. The Nothing Phone 4a Pro has been on the horizon for several months now. After the Phone 4a and 4a Pro first appeared back in September , some of their specifications were tipped last month alongside hints of a new affordable headphone from the brand. A more recent leak now reveals the charging speed and the slightly increased battery capacity.",

App users on Reddit are reporting multiple issues that cause the launcher to crash during the setup process and hide their app icons. The latest Nova Launcher build is version 8.2.8, now rolling out across the beta and stable release channels. Nova Launcher, the popular Android launcher thought to have shut down in September 2025 , is officially back, but with a twist. The app started receiving regular updates in November ahead of an ownership change this month. Branch Metrics sold Nova Launcher to the Swedish company Instabridge, which quickly began laying the groundwork for in-app advertisements . Now, the recent updates to Nova Launcher appear to have broken the app, with users on Reddit reporting critical bugs and crashes. The most recent Nova Launcher beta build, version 8.2.8, started reaching users a few days ago. The latest version 8.2.8 is also rolling out across the stable channel as of Saturday, January 24, according to the app’s Google Play Store listing .

Real-time QR code scanning is a major upgrade, helping users avoid fake login pages and malware-filled sites instantly. Improved social message analysis makes it easier to catch scams that look like normal conversations. Online scams keep getting more advanced and harder to notice. Scammers use tricks like fake QR codes on restaurant tables and urgent messages from hacked social accounts to blend in with daily digital life. McAfee wants to tackle this growing problem with a new update to its Scam Detector service. McAfee just announced big improvements to its Scam Detector tool, like instant QR code scam checks and better protection for social messaging apps. Now, instead of only reacting after a scam happens, the software helps right when you’re about to click, scan, or reply. If you’ve ever paused before clicking a strange link or scanning a code in public, this update is meant for you.",

Amid a recent blitz of Galaxy S26 rumors and leaks, we’ve heard about color options a couple of times: first in the context of leaked images of the S26 Ultra’s SIM card tray , then in a second rumor that corroborated the colors from that initial leak while claiming the existence of two more.

Leaker theonecid posted on Twitter today that the Galaxy S26 series will come in four colors: black, white, Cobalt Violet, and Sky Blue.
