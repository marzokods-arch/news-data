After developing Genie 3 last year, Google’s turned it into an interactive experiment with Project Genie. While Project Genie lets you create and explore worlds, it’s currently limited to AI Ultra subscribers. There’s no denying that generative AI can produce some impressive results, and while it’s easy to see that success and imagine some even grander possibilities, actually distilling all that promise down into an easy-to-use, reliable tool can prove particularly challenging. Last year, Google showed off its Genie 3 world-building engine — give it a prompt, and it could create realistic scenes, ready to explore. And now it’s finally your chance to try this magic out for yourself, as Google launches Project Genie . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Support was previously removed to distance the project from game piracy. The removal prompted forks that restored support, causing confusion for users. Azahar provided a light at the end of the tunnel after the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra was caught in the crossfire of Nintendo’s legal actions against Yuzu, but there was always one major complaint. A complaint that earned it countless poor reviews on Google Play, causing great confusion among users and spawning several sketchy forks. That change is the removal of support for .3ds files, which is by far the most common ROM file type for Nintendo 3DS games. The team claimed this was to distance the project from its predecessor’s dubious roots in piracy, but in practice, all you needed to do was change the file extension from .3ds to .cci, and it still worked, provided the files were not encrypted.",

Google has agreed to pay $135 million to settle a class action suit over “appropriating” Android users’ mobile data. The suit accused Google of harvesting Android user data over cellular connections without their consent, including at times when Google’s apps were closed on those users’ devices. As reported by Reuters , a preliminary settlement was filed Tuesday night and is pending approval from a judge. Assuming there aren’t any last-minute changes, anyone in the US (outside of California) who’s accessed the internet using a cellular network on an Android device since November 12, 2017 will be eligible to claim part of the settlement.",

    "body": "Credit: Rogbid TL;DR Rogbid’s Fusion is a smart ring that looks like a shrunken smartwatch, screen and all. It goes further than many novelty ring watches by adding health and fitness tracking. At $49.99, it’s cheap enough to be a weird gift, and even has a “couple interaction mode.” Smart rings have been edging closer to smartwatches for a while now, but Rogbid has taken a more literal approach. The company has just launched the Rogbid Fusion, a device that looks like a smartwatch shrunk down into ring form, complete with a screen, health tracking, and even the option to wear it on your wrist instead. Rogbid isn’t a big name in wearables, but it’s been selling budget smart devices for years. As spotted by The Verge , the Fusion is now available from Rogbid’s online store for $49.99. That’s far cheaper than most ring watches, and it comes in gold, silver, and black finishes.",

It allows you to log in to your Epic Games account to browse and download games on your Android device. Support is still experimental, and multiplayer games are not working. The age of PC emulation on Android is upon us, with new translation layers and software allowing you to play Steam games on your phone or Android gaming handheld without any fuss. Now, for the first time, you’ll also be able to play titles from the Epic Games Store library, thanks to a nightly update from GameNative. And if you’re like me, that amounts to literally hundreds of free games claimed over the years. While support is still experimental, the setup is fairly straightforward. After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration. From there, it will open a browser where you can log in to your Epic Games account. Then, you need to copy an authentication key, paste it into GameNative, and it should automatically populate your game list (give it a minute if you have 500+ games like me).",

Multiple users on Reddit have confirmed that issues with their Galaxy Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic have resolved. The update also brings the January 2026 security update. The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",

Honestly, why is modern UX too often hard to get right? But if there’s one thing worse than either of them, it’s brands copying each other’s bad choices. The revelation that Android 17 is preparing to adopt parts of Apple’s transparent aesthetic had me reaching for the sick bucket.",

Global sales start on February 12 at $499 for the 12+256 version, or $599 for the 16+512GB version. The gaming phone landscape is looking pretty grim in 2026, with ASUS stepping back from the smartphone market and newer flagship chips suffering from poor thermal performance. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro is one of the last gaming phones on the market (and our top pick for the best gaming phone ), but now it’s set to get a cheaper, more pocketable sibling. The REDMAGIC 11 Air is a slightly slimmed-down version of the 11 Pro, but not by much. The company writes that it’s “12% thinner and 10% lighter” than its larger sibling, with the same 6.85-inch 144Hz AMOLED panel. It’s still roughly as thick as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra at 8mm, but the flat back means there’s no camera bump to get in your way while you game.",

Instead, it will focus on its Phone 4a series and audio products. Pei says the decision is backed by the intensifying competition to acquire smartphone components. The Nothing Phone 3 can be classified as less than a success. While it excelled in terms of fun, quirky features , the Phone 3 did not thrive in terms of practicality or value. Despite its novelty, the non-flagship chipset and an $800 price tag easily made the phone feel impractical . And Nothing appears to have taken the verdict to the heart, to the effect that it is taking 2026 to mull over flagships instead of releasing one. In a recent video shared on the official Nothing YouTube channel, co-founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship phone in 2026. This could be a shocker for Nothing fans, as it seemingly was for the staff member speaking with Pei on the talk show. But coming from the outspoken CEO himself, there’s little room for realignment.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Global smartphone chipset shipments are expected to fall 7% in 2026, but industry revenue is still set to grow in double digits. AI-driven data center demand is pushing chipmakers toward high-margin HBM, driving up DRAM prices and squeezing phone makers. Budget phones under $150 are taking the biggest hit as rising costs make low-end devices harder to sustain. The smartphone industry is facing a paradox. Counterpoint Research reports that global smartphone chipset shipments will drop by 7% in 2026. Normally, fewer shipments would mean trouble for the industry , but this time, manufacturers are still expected to see double-digit revenue growth. So, why are shipments dropping? Part of the reason is the growing demand from data centers . As AI becomes more common, chipmakers are shifting their resources to produce high-margin HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for large server farms. This shift has caused DRAM prices to rise sharply, making it harder for manufacturers to create affordable phones without taking a loss.",

Many reports also suggest that the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi issues may have been patched. Google is terribly late at delivering the latest January update to supported Pixel devices. While the update was initially rolled out on January 12 , many users reported not receiving it until earlier this week. More than a thousand Android Authority readers also corroborated this in a recent survey. Thankfully, it appears Google may have finally ironed out what was causing the delay. We’re seeing new reports from multiple Pixel owners on Reddit confirming they finally received the January update. Reddit user Different_Dinner8195 recently posted in the Google Pixel subreddit, declaring they were finally able to download and install the update on their Pixel 10 Pro. As with many others who reported this earlier, the January update first appeared for the user but then disappeared mysteriously, leaving folks wondering whether Google pulled the update.

One such change is Ask Photos, an AI-powered search feature intended to help people find content with natural language queries.

Xiaomi promises four years of Android updates and six years of security patches for these Hyper OS 2 phones. The worsening RAM crisis and resulting price increases have brought mid-range Android phones back into focus, but they also push consumers to demand more from them. Not only are phones expected to be good enough to handle all needs, but they should also be durable enough to withstand everyday wear and tear and the occasional drop.

The company says the issue affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under rare conditions. Manual and automatic Call Screen still work, and callers can continue using standard carrier voicemail instead. Most recent Pixel features have been welcome additions, but one meant to handle missed calls has instead caused a bit of a privacy snafu. Over the past few months, some users reported that callers could hear background audio during missed calls, rather than being cleanly prompted to leave a message. Google has now confirmed the issue and says it’s disabling Take a Message on the affected devices. In a post on its support forums , Siri Tejaswini, a Google community manager, said the company investigated the reports and confirmed they affect “a very small subset” of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under “very specific and rare circumstances.” Out of caution, Google is disabling Take a Message and its next-generation Call Screen features on those phones.",

AI-generated images just found a new canvas: your wall. SwitchBot’s latest isn’t a robot or a smart lock. It’s a collection of E Ink picture frames that double as always-on AI art displays. On the hardware side, the frames feature E Ink Spectra 6 technology, designed to mimic the layered look of real paint on real paper. As with other E Ink displays, the result is glare-free, backlight-free, and easy on the eyes, making it better suited as wall art than an LCD or OLED screen. Through the SwitchBot app, users can upload and organize artwork, store up to 10 images locally, sync new content, and schedule images to cycle on and off at given times of day. The frames are available in 7.3-inch, 13.3-inch, and 31.5-inch builds, each of which supports both horizontal and vertical orientations.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 series’s launch pricing may be the same as last year’s S25 series, at least in some markets. This is contrary to earlier reporting that suggested increased RAM prices would lead to higher S26 prices for consumers. The leak in question deals with pricing in Euros, and we can’t be totally sure what it means for US pricing. RAM prices have been soaring in recent months , a trend that’s caused product delays and fueled concern that new consumer electronics of all kinds will see reduced memory, higher sticker prices, or both. It was reported in November that the upcoming Galaxy S26 series was likely to see a RAM-induced price hike versus last year’s S25 phones, but a new leak suggests that might not be the case. Leaker Roland Quandt posted today on Bluesky that pricing for S26 base models will be “pretty much the same” as the S25 at launch, at least in European markets. His post goes on to say that the S26 Ultra may actually be less expensive, coming in about “100 Euro cheaper for 256 and 512GB” models, though he’s expecting the one-terabyte version’s pricing to remain the same.",

Throughout Artemis II, astronaut voice, images, video, and vital mission data must traverse thousands of miles, carried on signals from NASA’s communications systems. Through Artemis , NASA is establishing an enduring presence in space and exploring more of the Moon than ever before. To achieve this, Artemis missions rely on both the Near Space Network and the Deep Space Network.

This result, made using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and James Webb Space Telescope, will lead astronomers to rethink when and how the largest structures in the universe formed. The findings are described in a paper published [Wednesday] in the journal Nature. The object, known as JADES-ID1 for its location in the “JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey” (JADES) has a mass about 20 trillion times that of the Sun. Astronomers classify JADES-ID1 as a “protocluster” because it is currently undergoing an early, violent phase of formation and will one day turn into a galaxy cluster. However, JADES-ID1 is found at a much larger distance – corresponding to a much earlier time in the universe – than astronomers expect…",

The vivo X200 Ultra was the first Android phone to offer the new generation of telephoto extender lenses , and subsequent vivo and OPPO flagships support these add-on lenses too. These accessories attach to the phone’s telephoto camera to improve long-range zoom. Now, Apple could also be testing this tech for the iPhone 18 Pro series. Weibo leaker Smart Pikachu reported that Apple is evaluating teleconverter lenses, with an accompanying hashtag suggesting that this could land on the iPhone 18 Pro series. Check out the machine-translated post below.",

For one, the update targeted battery drain while also taming unruly ringback tones. But while a dozen Pixel devices should’ve received the update, not everyone’s device did. Several days later , users online noted that they still hadn’t received a peep of a patch on their devices, but we weren’t aware of how many of our readers were affected. So, we ran a poll, and it turns out that Google Pixel’s update delays are more prevalent than you probably think.",

In my previous rentals, I had a bath with a shower curtain, which made it easy to prop up my phone on the nearby vanity to play podcasts while I got ready in the morning. Paying for a standalone speaker seemed like a luxurious upgrade then, not a necessity. But after moving to my new home a year ago, I missed this setup. My glass-enclosed shower blocks most of the sound coming from my phone; even with the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s louder speaker and the trick of using corners to amplify sound, I couldn’t hear it clearly in the shower. So I started looking for options from Soundcore, JBL, Tribit, Bose, and others, and eventually made an impulse buy in the unlikeliest of places: the IKEA home electronics section.",

The ITF has approved various models of the WHOOP tracker for match use so long as haptic feedback is disabled, but Grand Slam events can impose additional rules independently. WHOOP responded by sending its Body apparel collection, which conceals the tracker within undergarments, to players, though using them still risks violating competition regulations. WHOOP makes one of the most interesting fitness trackers around, focusing entirely on strain, recovery, and long-term performance rather than on-wrist features, to the point that it does not even have a display. It’s a niche device that works out well for athletes who want deeper insights into their bodies.

Google Chrome is the world’s most popular web browser on PCs, but it also has a reputation for being a resource hog. Now, Google has implemented a toggle that’s convenient in theory, but also means the browser can suck up resources as soon as you start your computer.

The toggle, which is apparently off by default but functional, opens a Chrome window as soon as you boot up your PC.

Unlike the more premium Phone 3, which largely disappointed with its inflated pricing, Nothing’s Phone 3a and the 3a Pro impressed with their high value proposition and features absent from mid-range phones. Naturally, the successors, Nothing Phone 4a and Phone 4a Pro, have big shoes to fill. We expect the series to come with reasonable upgrades without a significant price increase, and a recent leak proves this assumption may be partially true. The Nothing Phone 4a Pro has been on the horizon for several months now. After the Phone 4a and 4a Pro first appeared back in September , some of their specifications were tipped last month alongside hints of a new affordable headphone from the brand.

The Commission will issue preliminary findings within three months, along with a draft of the measures it intends to impose on Google to comply with the DMA.
