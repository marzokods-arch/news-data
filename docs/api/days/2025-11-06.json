A Redditor who goes by the handle ashleysaidwhat has apparently attached a pair of trucks to an Asus ROG Astral RTX 5080 . The result is a seemingly workable skateboard, of sorts. \"She's a 5080 Astral but she looks like a 5090, and she handles like a TUF,\" is all the poster has to say. The rest is Reddit history and presumably a future podcast series. Was the RTX 5080 already bricked? Hopefully. Is it now completely toast as an actual GPU? Almost certainly. Is it even a full graphics card, or just a CPU cooler attached to some kind of board beneath? We may never know. Personally, I'm guessing the latter. While the cooler checks out as matching the Astral RTX 5080, there's no end bracket. Likewise, the PCIe connector with all the electrical contact points isn't visible and, as you can see from the official Asus image below, it sticks out quite a lot in reality.

In a statement to the press, Rockstar claimed the fired employees were \"distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum\" and that the firings were \"in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities.\" These explanations did not wash with the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB)—a trade union focused on organising precarious and under-unionised sectors of employment—which accused Rockstar of \"the most brazen act of union busting the games industry has ever seen.\" The IWGB says that, contrary to Rockstar's allegations of leaking company secrets, the only outsiders the employees were speaking to were union organisers.

It's not that I'm friendly, but I am absolutely cowardly. Gimme some AI to stomp, rather than a sweaty gamer who might—god forbid—actually be better at the game than me. This is why the only extraction shooter I've really vibed with is the striking, atmospheric, PvE-only The Forever Winter . But with Arc Raiders being all anyone can talk about at the moment, I thought I should at least check it out. Arc Raiders shares some similarities with The Forever Winter, with its biggest threats all being robotic monstrosities, and with players all serving as desperate scavengers. And I was intrigued by what I heard about the community: that murder was not the end result of every meeting of players . (Image credit: Embark) But the moment I met my first group of also-humans, I went into my default mode, more than three decades of gaming teaching me to shoot first, ask questions not at all.

Other UI mods will stay untouched, but anything that gives you an overt advantage in a fight? It's being sent to the void. I can't say I blame Blizzard for this, even if I was hesitant at first . I still think the studio's taking on a huge task, given it's also having to completely redesign its classes to exist in an AddOn-less world, but assuming Blizzard can pull it off? I think the game'll be better for it. That's not to say there aren't bumps in the road. For example; some of those proposed changes note that Blizzard \"will NOT be allowing AddOns to support timer emphasis\". Say, for example, the 'three, two, one' audio cue that often comes with AddOns like Deadly Boss Mods (DBM). That's per an interview game director Ion Hazzikostas had with the authors of two major mods, Bigwigs and DBM.

Climbing through Roots is not for the faint of heart. The first challenge is the environment itself, as you have to rely on vines and bouncy mushrooms to get where you need to go.

Google has recently warned \"adversaries are no longer leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) just for productivity gains, they are deploying novel AI-enabled malware in active operations\". The report (via Bleeping Computer ) says that, for the first time, Google \"discovered a code family that employed AI capabilities mid-execution to dynamically alter the malware’s behaviour.\" Google pays attention to one particular malware named Promptflux, which is a dropper that prompts Gemini to rewrite its own source code, \"saving the new, obfuscated version to the Startup folder to establish persistence.\" Like an actual virus, this suggests it has the ability to 'evolve' in some way, getting smarter and harder to get rid of.

    "body": "The latest data from Trendforce says DDR5 spot prices have gone up 30% in the last week alone and something in the region of 170%, year-on-year. Meanwhile, on the likes of Amazon, many DDR5 kit retail prices have doubled since August. The upshot of which is that while PC memory prices look unappealing right now, there's almost certainly worse to come. In really simple terms, there's a lag between spot pricing—which is the price DDR5 memory kit makers pay for DDR5 memory chips—and what we poor PC fans have to pay for actual memory kits. In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices. Many popular DDR5 kits have seen prices essentially double since August. By way of example, take the Crucial Pro 32 GB DDR5 RAM Kit . It was $83 in August. Now it's $…",

Instead, there's only one place you can find them during your climb, and even then, you've got a 50/50 chance of one appearing. Hot dogs will only spawn around the campfire in each biome , and even then, there's still a chance you may spawn a marshmallow instead.

Alas, it's just been delayed by a month, mere hours before its scheduled November 6 release date. According to RJ Lake at studio D-Cell Games, the delay is unavoidable. \"There’s a very boring and frustrating reason,\" Lake wrote on Steam . \"QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and not fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it.\" In other words, a rare progress-blocking bug was discovered at the eleventh hour and, because pushing updates to console platforms is much more time-consuming than it is on Steam, the studio and its publisher Playstack have decided to push the whole affair back by a month. Unbeatable will now release on December 9. That is over a month from the game's expected launch, which is probably frustrating for anyone looking f…",

And now Ball x Pit is slightly better because the November patch fixes a bunch of bugs, and as the top patch note explains, the encyclopedia has been updated with full-color icons. This may seem like a small thing, but the original version not only looked bland, but made it tough to tell at a glance whether you were looking at, say, a poison ball or an ice ball. Now that one is green and the other blue like God intended that's no longer an issue. (It was enough of an annoyance there was even a now-redundant Encyclopedia Colored mod .) The update also changes the way the retry option works: \"Retry no longer causes resources gained in previous run to be lost\".

Jennifer Hale, the voice actor playing Jedi Master Bastila Shan in Knights of the Old Republic, did not know the twist in advance. As is often the case in videogame recording, she didn't get to see the script until she was in the booth. \"We never got our scripts ahead of time\", Hale recently told Buzzfeed . \"Most of the games I've ever done have been cold reading.

The moment, captured above, was from Gates' keynote at the then-major COMDEX trade show a few months before Windows 98's launch. Microsoft's Chris Capossela was in the middle of demonstrating a novel feature—plug-and-play USB support—by hooking up a scanner, prompting Windows 98 to download its drivers. Then, wham: Blue Screen of Death. Gates takes it in stride, quipping \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet,\" but I always figured somebody got chewed out for the crash afterward.

Are we $20 lawn guys?\" The idea that you can put the word \"simulator\" after any job or mundane activity and make a videogame out of it used to be a joke at the expense of series like Farming Simulator, but it's no joke anymore. A cottage industry has grown around simulating every job and activity it's possible to simulate: hairdressing, gold mining, home renovating, power washing, you name it. And inevitably, the people who actually do these jobs show up in the Steam user reviews to tell us how well the game matches reality, which is how I learned recently that firefighters do not, in fact, use the \"fireman's carry\" where you sling someone over your shoulders.

Serious fans were unhappy, though, for a number of reasons, foremost among them the music. Music in the original Plants vs. Zombies is dynamic, you see, changing with the events on the screen, but for some reason EA did away with that in the remaster—instead, it only played the \"high intensity\" version of the soundtrack. It sounds like a minor thing (even at its most intense, PvZ music is pretty not intense ) but holy cow, did people notice—including composer Laura Shigihara—and they did not care for it .

Yet there are still, inevitably, those who would prey upon this tenuous peace.

And, I suppose, some of you might also have your fingers crossed for Fallout: New Vegas 2. You probably shouldn't hold your breath waiting for it to happen, though. In an interview with The Game Business , Obsidian vice president of operations Marcus Morgan and vice president of development Justin Britch said they know lots of people want followups to the studio's greatest hits, but the developers who work there are more interested in doing other things. The hangup is that after years of making games based on other people's properties—KOTOR 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, Dungeon Siege 3, South Park: The Stick of Truth—Obsidian is apparently having a pretty good time doing its own thing. \"I know everyone on the internet, on every game we ever announce, will constantly reference back to, when’s the next New Vegas?

It should be \"The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine,\" right? That's what our quiz below is all about: I'm going to show you the names of some games with the punctuation removed, and you'll have to guess if they contain a colon, a dash, both, or neither. For simplicity's sake, I'm considering a hyphen a dash in this quiz (even though they're not the same thing), so if a game name has any kind of horizontal line in it, that counts! Since sometimes there's not universal agreement on how a game's name is punctuated across different sites (such as Steam and Wikipedia), I've gone to the publisher's website (when possible) for the definitive answer. Think you can remember if a game's title contains a colon, a dash (or hyphen), both, or neither? Give it your best shot, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers.

And it's those 40 CUs, plus Strix Halo's exceptionally wide (for an APU) 256-bit bus, that make it so appealing, on paper, for gaming.

But that has a downsized GPU with 32 CUs, significantly lessening the appeal of the device. Anyway, the \"base\" model with the top-tier 395 APU kicks off with a hefty 48 GB of memory. If that sounds like overkill, especially for a handheld, remember it's shared between the CPU and GPU. You also get a 1 TB SSD. The OneXFly Apex can be optioned up to 128 GB of memory and a 2 TB SSD.

Yet because of the way the Internet works, what players see in a demo playback may not reflect the game they experienced with complete accuracy. As of Counter-Strike 2's latest update, however, players should find playbacks better representative of live matches. This is thanks to a new feature Valve introduced to the demo system named TrueView. \"With TrueView, demo playback will match the player's original experience much more closely,\" Valve writes in a Steam post . \"Previously demo playback showed the server's view of the world, without accounting for network latency.

But according to its creative director Alex Hutchinson, the comedic cooperative adventure hasn't made all that much money, despite over a million people playing it across PC, console, and services like Game Pass. In fact, one might argue that the last sentence should read 'because' rather than 'despite'. Hutchinson certainly reckons that Game Pass is part of the problem. Speaking to FRVR , Hutchinson explained that although Microsoft's service exposed Revenge of the Savage Planet to hordes of new players, this didn't convert into cold, hard cash for developer Raccoon Logic. \"We’ve had millions of players and that’s great, but people have an expectation of getting things for free these days—whether that’s through Game Pass or other things—it hasn’t monetised as well as we would like, which is pretty dangerous,\" he told the site. Hutchinson then elaborated that Revenge was \"not a super cheap game\" to make, and that because it was funded largely by Tencent, it is \"not a game w…",

That's per an interview Houser had with Lex Fridman , which you can also find below. Houser says that, circa '98, \"my life was a mess. I was in South America, in Colombia, when there was a war waging there. I was making a series of very poor life choices, and the lack of life skills aged 25—my latest poor choice was to get up too early.\" Colombia during the '90s was, to risk an understatement, not exactly the best place to be , which is something Houser discovered first-hand: \"The police didn't start work 'till nine but the muggers started at eight. I was out walking along the beach at eight.\" He recalls speaking with someone on the beach before \"two guys came to talk to him, and I couldn't tell if they were trying to mug him, if he owed the money, or if he'd bought me to them. \"One of them had a machete and one of t…",

Thanks to both the film and reality, Burry made his name foreseeing the sub-prime housing market collapse and World Financial Crisis it precipitated in 2008. Fair to say he has form when it comes to predicting financial catastrophe. According to Fortune , it seems Burry sees just such a calamity befalling Nvidia. His hedge fund, known as Scion Asset Management, has reportedly bought $1 billion in put options on Nvidia and another AI-adjacent company, Palantir. In really simple terms, put options give the holder the right to sell a company's stock at a fixed price in the future rather than the prevailing market price.

    "summary": "Nvidia's hopes of returning to the Chinese market continue to dwindle.",
    "body": "New data centre projects in China must use homegrown AI hardware going forward. According to Reuters , new government guidance will soon be passed down, apparently requiring state-funded data centres to only use AI chips manufactured domestically within China. Though data centre projects have drawn $100 billion in state funding since 2021, it is not yet clear how many will be affected by this decree. It's China's latest bid to break away from US-made tech, and follows news back in August that data centre operators were being instructed to source at least 50% of their chips from domestic manufacturers . Now, data centres that are less than 30% complete are being instructed to remove already installed chips if they're foreign-made. One facility in a northwestern province that planned to deploy Nvidia chips has allegedly already been suspended before even breaking ground as a result of the latest guidance. However, it's being decided on a case-by-case basis whether data centre projects at a more advanced stage can keep their foreign-made chips. Reuters' sources say it's not yet clear if this guidance will be a nationwide decree, or only apply to certain provinces. It's also not yet c…",

    "summary": "It's the semiconductor version of one potato, two potato.",
    "body": "For 60 years, Gordon Moore's observation that transistor counts in integrated circuits would double roughly every two years has been spookily accurate. Ever-smaller transistors and ever-larger chips have made this possible, but with the physical limits of both impacting the growth of computing, new methods are required to continue the growth. One semiconductor research team claims to have achieved just that by stacking not chips or dies, but individual transistors. The work by the team at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia was published in Nature Electronics (via El País ), and as is always the case for such academic research, it's all very complicated. Basically, though, it comes down to the idea that chip makers are looking to go up , rather than using smaller transistors or wider dies, to keep Moore's 'law' alive. Processors such as AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilise hybrid bonding techniques to stack dies on top of each other, to increase the number of transistors in the whole package, so there's more cache. All SSDs today rely on multi-layer NAND flash memory to improve capacity, performance, and reliability. However, none of these methods f…",
