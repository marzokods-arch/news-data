    "body": "The demise of traditional x86 PC processors in favour of leaner, more efficient Arm chips has been predicted since, well, it seems like forever. For that notion to gain any traction for PC gaming, however, support for discrete graphics cards is needed. Say hello, then, to the Minisforum MS-R1 (via PC Watch ), a compact PC with an Arm chip and a full-sized x16 PCIe graphics slot. Game over for x86? Not so fast. For starters, the Minisforum MS-R1 runs a Cixin P1 CPU . It's a Chinese made chip built on 6 nm technology and configured with eight Cortex A720 performance and four Cortex A520 efficiency cores. In other words, we're talking off-the-shelf Arm cores first introduced in 2023 and part of Arm's mid-range Cortex A700 range, which is more about efficient mobility than outright performance. Arm's Cortex X900 series and, soon, the C1 Ultra, represent Arm's most performant cores of the moment. This is also a compact machine. So, even with that full physical x16 graphics slot, you're not going to be fitting an RTX 5090. Even a mid-range GPU probably won't fit. The slot is also limited to eight PCIe Gen 4 lanes, electrically, which is arguably suboptimal, even if, in reality, that's u…",

If you've been a PC enthusiast for as long as I have, then you'll probably look at SilverStone's new full-tower case with a warm heart and happy, fuzzy feelings. That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm. It comes with two 120 mm fans installed at the front, below the ro…",

    "body": "Red Dead Redemption's ending—which, heads up, I am gonna spoil here—is famous for a reason. Gamers are a cosseted bunch, and it was (heck, it continues to be) very rare that an open world didn't stick you right back in the protagonist's boots after credits rolled, so you could go mop up whatever side quests and activities you hadn't done yet. RDR bucked that expectation when it straight-up killed poor ol' John Marston at the end. Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish. Why didn't he? Because unlike RDR, killing off Niko just didn't quite gel with how Rockstar had set up GTA 4. \"You know, the game do…",

Cue the A Reveal in Ruins mission in Arc Raiders , where Lance asks you to find another analyser for his research. Although A Reveal in Ruins has two steps to complete in a single round, it's really only one: find an ESR Analyser inside any pharmacy in Buried City. After that, you just need to deliver it to Lance back at Speranza. With that in mind, I recommend against a free loadout so that you have access to a safe pocket. So, here's where to find the pharmacies in Buried City to grab a new analyser for Lance.

For the unaware, the Expeditions system is basically Arc Raiders' answer to hardcore players asking for regular account wipes. It's voluntary, unlike in Escape from Tarkov, but it'll reset pretty much all of your progression and effectively retire your character, letting you create a new raider and start from scratch every eight or so weeks. It's like prestige mode in Call of Duty. The issue many are running into is that, without a respec option, sending your character on an Expedition is the only way to reset your skill tree if you didn't go for the best skills —not helped by the fact that most Mobility skills don't work how you think they do .

Initially, Ubisoft tried to mollify said crowd , calm them down which… Well, it went about as well as you'd expect. The sky didn't fall. What actually happened was that the game sold pretty well as an entertaining open world romp, and we all moved on with our lives. In other words, Ubisoft made an Ubisoft game . Nothing exploded because a Black samurai was in it. Gaming survived. Part of why Shadows' release was uneventful was, in part, because of Ubisoft's sudden pivot to, essentially, ' stop feeding the trolls .' Speaking at a BAFTA event last year, former franchise head Marc-Alexis Coté put his foot down: \"When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away. We cannot let that happen. It's time for us as creators to stand firm on our commitment to our values, by telling stories that inspire, that challenge and t…",

And I'm making him test a ton of different cheap tech I might find on Amazon, AliExpress, TikTok Shop, or down the back of my sofa. Out of nowhere it will appear on his doorstep with no warning and he has no choice but to use whatever it is like his life depends on it. Because it does. Returning home one evening after a night of revelry, I discovered a mysterious Amazon box on my doorstep I had no memory of ordering. No, it wasn't the whiskey playing tricks on me, it was instead another gift from my mischievous editor-in-chief. This time he's sent me a $23 Amazon Basics USB condenser microphone to review. Goody. Actually, I shouldn't be so quick to judge. Pulling the mic from its default cardboard packaging reveals a surprisingly weighty little chassis, and that's a promising start. I've had the privilege of working with some roadworthy audio equipment over the years, and the little Amazon Basics mic has the same sort of heft I'd usually associate with something gig-proof, like a Shure SM58 or SM57.

A Redditor who goes by the handle ashleysaidwhat has apparently attached a pair of trucks to an Asus ROG Astral RTX 5080 . The result is a seemingly workable skateboard, of sorts. \"She's a 5080 Astral but she looks like a 5090, and she handles like a TUF,\" is all the poster has to say. The rest is Reddit history and presumably a future podcast series. Was the RTX 5080 already bricked? Hopefully. Is it now completely toast as an actual GPU? Almost certainly. Is it even a full graphics card, or just a CPU cooler attached to some kind of board beneath? We may never know. Personally, I'm guessing the latter. While the cooler checks out as matching the Astral RTX 5080, there's no end bracket. Likewise, the PCIe connector with all the electrical contact points isn't visible and, as you can see from the official Asus image below, it sticks out quite a lot in reality.

    "body": "World of Warcraft: Midnight is doing something pretty huge—with Blizzard taking aim at the game's combat mods, also known as AddOns , by making changes to the API (which feeds them the info they need to work). Other UI mods will stay untouched, but anything that gives you an overt advantage in a fight? It's being sent to the void. I can't say I blame Blizzard for this, even if I was hesitant at first . I still think the studio's taking on a huge task, given it's also having to completely redesign its classes to exist in an AddOn-less world, but assuming Blizzard can pull it off? I think the game'll be better for it. That's not to say there aren't bumps in the road. For example; some of those proposed changes note that Blizzard \"will NOT be allowing AddOns to support timer emphasis\". Say, for example, the 'three, two, one' audio cue that often comes with AddOns like Deadly Boss Mods (DBM). That's per an interview game director Ion Hazzikostas had with the authors of two major mods, Bigwigs and DBM. Hazzikostas, later wanting to clarify his statements in a thread posted to the game's subreddit, writes : \"We're working on a blog that can be a single source of truth there. The overarc…",

But now, thanks to the games' new update, there's a lot more for you to navigate. I naively thought that the only hurdle we'd have to overcome as part of this update were the spiders teased in the trailer. Even then, I didn't think they'd spawn as frequently as they do. But my God, having now forced my partner to navigate the perils of the Roots update with me, I've seen that there is actually a lot more than just spiders and the standard status effects to worry about. Climbing through Roots is not for the faint of heart. The first challenge is the environment itself, as you have to rely on vines and bouncy mushrooms to get where you need to go.

Google has recently warned \"adversaries are no longer leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) just for productivity gains, they are deploying novel AI-enabled malware in active operations\". The report (via Bleeping Computer ) says that, for the first time, Google \"discovered a code family that employed AI capabilities mid-execution to dynamically alter the malware’s behaviour.\" Google pays attention to one particular malware named Promptflux, which is a dropper that prompts Gemini to rewrite its own source code, \"saving the new, obfuscated version to the Startup folder to establish persistence.\" Like an actual virus, this suggests it has the ability to 'evolve' in some way, getting smarter and harder to get rid of.

    "body": "The latest data from Trendforce says DDR5 spot prices have gone up 30% in the last week alone and something in the region of 170%, year-on-year. Meanwhile, on the likes of Amazon, many DDR5 kit retail prices have doubled since August. The upshot of which is that while PC memory prices look unappealing right now, there's almost certainly worse to come. In really simple terms, there's a lag between spot pricing—which is the price DDR5 memory kit makers pay for DDR5 memory chips—and what we poor PC fans have to pay for actual memory kits. In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices. Many popular DDR5 kits have seen prices essentially double since August. By way of example, take the Crucial Pro 32 GB DDR5 RAM Kit . It was $83 in August. Now it's $…",

Hot dogs will only spawn around the campfire in each biome , and even then, there's still a chance you may spawn a marshmallow instead.

Alas, it's just been delayed by a month, mere hours before its scheduled November 6 release date. According to RJ Lake at studio D-Cell Games, the delay is unavoidable. \"There’s a very boring and frustrating reason,\" Lake wrote on Steam . \"QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and not fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it.\" In other words, a rare progress-blocking bug was discovered at the eleventh hour and, because pushing updates to console platforms is much more time-consuming than it is on Steam, the studio and its publisher Playstack have decided to push the whole affair back by a month. Unbeatable will now release on December 9. That is over a month from the game's expected launch, which is probably frustrating for anyone looking f…",

Music in the original Plants vs. Zombies is dynamic, you see, changing with the events on the screen, but for some reason EA did away with that in the remaster—instead, it only played the \"high intensity\" version of the soundtrack. It sounds like a minor thing (even at its most intense, PvZ music is pretty not intense ) but holy cow, did people notice—including composer Laura Shigihara—and they did not care for it . Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted landed with a sub-50% \"mixed\" rating on Steam, quite a contrast to the \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating the old GOTY Edition holds. I created the music in Plants vs. Zombies with the specific intention of it being dynamic. Instruments gradually appear to match the intensity of zombies & prevent audio fatigue.Replanted Level 1-1: ALL THE DRUMS RIGHT AWAYYears later + bigg…",

In an interview with The Game Business , Obsidian vice president of operations Marcus Morgan and vice president of development Justin Britch said they know lots of people want followups to the studio's greatest hits, but the developers who work there are more interested in doing other things.

It features the titular anime girl, Lulua, standing by a horse-drawn cart, with another character peering out of the cart as it's being pulled down a country road. It's an image of idyllic fantasy, seemingly matching the Atelier brief (which I'm led to understand is a generally lighthearted affair about slice-of-life alchemy).

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers.

Specifically, that's the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, the only version of AMD's Strix Halo mobile APU that's available with all 40 RDNA 3.5-spec graphics compute units available. And it's those 40 CUs, plus Strix Halo's exceptionally wide (for an APU) 256-bit bus, that make it so appealing, on paper, for gaming. But it also makes it expensive, as the new OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex amply proves. For the record, you can get the OneXFly Apex with Ryzen AI Max 385 starting at $1,399. But that has a downsized GPU with 32 CUs, significantly lessening the appeal of the device. Anyway, the \"base\" model with the top-tier 395 APU kicks off with a hefty 48 GB of memory. If that sounds like overkill, especially for a handheld, remember it's shared between the CPU and GPU. You also get a 1 TB SSD. The OneXFly Apex can be optioned up to 128 GB of memory and a 2 TB SSD.

As of Counter-Strike 2's latest update, however, players should find playbacks better representative of live matches. This is thanks to a new feature Valve introduced to the demo system named TrueView. \"With TrueView, demo playback will match the player's original experience much more closely,\" Valve writes in a Steam post . \"Previously demo playback showed the server's view of the world, without accounting for network latency.
