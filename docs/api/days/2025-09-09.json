As it turns out, that's on the menu too, and you don't even have to wait for it. Steel Soul mode is a permadeath mode that becomes available in the original Hollow Knight after completing the game for the first time, and it does indeed make the game more difficult: Just as in real life, death is not a condition from which one can recover. Steel Soul mode is also present in Silksong, revealed by the presence of the Steel Soul achievement on Steam. But as discovered by redditor Buttnugtaster —man, I love quoting redditors in news stories—the Steel Soul mode in Silksong is not restricted to replays. By going to the \"Extras\" menu and entering Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right on your controller, you can unlock the Steel Soul mode immediately. Why would you want to do that to yourself? Look, people ask me the same question about picking digital mushrooms in a virtual forest . Everyone…",

Lots of great games still release during this period, but the kinds of games that top Steam's wishlist chart tend to cluster at the beginning and end of the year, especially in February and October. This is a mistake, according to videogame market intelligence company Newzoo. In the free edition of the firm's 2025 Global Games Market Report , available today, Newzoo says that game publishers are causing \"avoidable cannibalization\" by all competing for attention and money at the same time of year. To come to its conclusion, Newzoo looked at triple-A singleplayer games that came out on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox between 2021 and 2024, defining triple-A in this case as games that cost $51 and up. February saw the most triple-A releases with 22, with October coming in just behind it with 21.

The Bardcore update and Boglands DLC drop simultaneously, on October 28. Bardcore will be free (hence \"free update,\" who'd have thought?) while Boglands will cost some money—how much remains to be seen. I don't know how much—developer Chasing Carrots has yet to slap a price tag on the new stuff, but with the base game costing a mere $6.66 (£5.49, because everything's less metal in Britain), I'm gonna venture a guess Boglands won't break your bank account. Unless your bank account has under five bucks in it, in which case you have my solidarity as another victim of capital. The free update by itself sounds pretty substantial. Bardcore brings a new character—the Bard, naturally—along with six new abilities for them, six new endgame artefacts, over 20 new quests, and manual level ups. Also, three new metal tracks, which is the most important entry on this list by quite some margin. But for the (p…",

What they found was a drop when moving over to the new Samsung memory, and gamers were quick to condemn the change. Like our reviewer of the RX 9060 XT XFX Swift GPU , many have been pleased by the performance from the budget friendly offering. It seems it might have been a bit too quick, as new comparisons spotted by VideoCardz are showing ways the Samsung GDDR6 may actually be more beneficial, if a little less powerful than the SK Hynix offering. AMD partner XFX posted comparisons to Bilibili , a Chinese social blog site that often delves into PC gaming hardware critique. They tell the same story of less powerful GDDR6, but with a huge boon to cooling and potentially power consumption. According to these tests the Samsung memory garnered temperatures 10°C lower than its SK Hynix counterpart, allowing for an almost 400 rpm drop in fan speeds. This means the S…",

All guild trial answers in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (Image credit: Warhorse Studios) As the first step of the test to become an accredited guild blacksmith, you'll be asked three random questions . If you get any of them wrong, you'll fail the theory section of the test, and that means you'll have to forge a much better weapon to be in with a chance. It's worth noting that even though you can pay money to retry the blade forging, you only get one shot at answering the questions (unless you load a save that is)…",

The most recent king of the genre is, I reckon, PT —Hideo Kojima's playable teaser (get it?) for the now-cancelled Silent Hills, made in collaboration with Guillermo del Toro. Konami has effectively obliterated all trace of the game from existence, but that doesn't mean people don't reflect wistfully on what could have been. People like, for instance, Bayonetta director Hideki Kamiya (via IGN ), who recently returned to one of his year-old threads on X to throw down the gauntlet over the game (kind of, in a very polite interpretation of throwing down a gauntlet). Per IGN's translation of the original Japanese, Kamiya wrote, \"If it’s impossible to resurrect PT, Kojima should make a new game in the same style… If Kojima doesn't do it, maybe I'll give it a go.\" A Kamiya-helmed PT sounds, well, kind of baffling. But baffling in a way I wouldn't mind seeing. It would also be very different from Kojima's effort: \"I h…",

Two of our hardware team have had such issues, so they'll be particularly interested in the Elecom VM800 , an 8K wireless gaming mouse with ultra-wideband (UWB) support. In fact, Elecom claims it's the world's first \"true 8K\" mouse with said feature (via PC Watch ). True 8K refers to an 8,000 Hz polling rate that updates at exactly the same time on both ends of the connection, rather than a regular 8K connection that can potentially report new data from the device very quickly, but might not be polling at the exact same rate at the receiver. Anyhoo, let's talk about that connection spec. 2.4 GHz is the defacto standard for most wireless gear, as it became the default frequency for early Wi-Fi connections. To this day it's got the longest range and wall-penetration ability of the available bands, but because it's in such high demand, it can be prone to signal saturation issues when multiple dev…",

Four solidly-stacked campaigns you might've entirely missed. While Borderlands 3's insistently wonky plot is otherwise a real obstacle, all of these DLCs stick to a theme and largely nail it.

More importantly, they don't oscillate between outdated memes and unsuccessful melodrama—they just grab a solid pitch and run with it.

As you travel across a simple overworld map, you gather flasks for your homunculus warriors. These basically allow you to create a production line of actions in battle—one might be a simple attack, another a strength buff, and another a berserker strike that sacrifices health for damage.

Setting out with a goal of making the Create, a bespoke keyboard for ergonomics and productivity, Naya's designs and plans resulted in a highly successful Kickstarter campaign . Multiple batches of the Create have already been sold out and shipped, and along with the sheer amount of money raised via crowdfunding, it's clear that there are a lot of computer users around the world who very much want one.

    "body": "Things are, once again, all shake-up at Intel. After a new CEO, tons of layoffs, an increased focus on the Foundry side of the business, and other changes, Intel is sticking on-brand and making even more changes, this time to executive leadership. And while the biggest news for many might be that Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus is leaving, what's particularly interesting is the company is starting a new group that will focus on a new custom silicon business. In addition to these two things, Intel also announced that Jim Johnson will lead the Client Computing Group (CCG), Kevork Kechichian from Arm will join to lead Intel's Data Center Group (DCG), and Intel Foundry CTOO Naga Chandrasekaran will also cover Foundry Services. The custom silicon business that's perhaps of most interest is to be headed up by senior VP and Fellow Srini Iyengar. Iyengar joined Intel earlier in the year after being a Fellow at Cadence Design Systems, which is of note because Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was previously CEO of Cadence until 2021. The new group will apparently be looking towards serving external customers: \"Intel is also establishing a new Central Engineering Group led by Srinivasan (S…",

The news was broken by Japanese outlet Friday Digital , with a representative for Matha Farm confirming that the mare had passed due to colic, a pretty common cause of death in horses. Her age was the equivalent of almost 90 in human years, and on the upper end of a horse's average lifespan. 【独自】さようなら、ハルウララ…〝113連敗した負け組の星〟が天国へと旅立っていたhttps://t.co/YfWnOynm6c#フライデー September 9, 2025 Haru Urara was born in 1996, making her debut race two years later before retiring in 2004.

Instead, I started my new job as manager of Hell and overlord of the humus, a sentient population of chickpeas. (Image credit: Team 17) Sintopia is kind of like two games in one. The overworld plays like a god game that has you casting spells to influence the humus. They go about their daily business with pretty limited intervention from you, farming crops, cutting down trees, electing a monarch to rule over them, and exploring the map to find new treasures and expand their village.

Back in 2024, he stated: \"By strongly differentiating the jobs, we will be able to reach the goal we have set ourselves.\" It is now 2025, however, and a recent PCGamesN interview from Gamescom is casting doubt. As always with these interviews, Yoshi-P often speaks in Japanese with a live interpreter, so specific word choice might be skewed based on the hard work of a poor translator having to suffer the Gamescom hall's terrible cafeteria prices and the stifling heat of a German summer. Still: \"When it comes to using the jobs in battle content and bringing out more of that uniqueness of each job, we are working on a big update.\" So far, so good, Yoshi-P.

    "body": "Silksong's getting its first patch next week—with a playable beta branch already available on Steam , and while there's the usual bug-fixes, one adjustment seems super interesting: Silksong's early game is going to get easier. Well, a little bit. As the patch notes linked above read, there'll be a \"Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter\", the former of which has been giving players considerable trouble . There'll also be a \"Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers\", which are the worms in the Blasted Steps—likely taking their damage from two masks to one. The game's rosary economy will also become less stingy: Relics, psalm cylinders, and courier deliveries will all have their rosary rewards increased, though I imagine it'll still be hard to match the farming routes already found by players—mind, any rosary bump is a welcome one, given how miserly the game is with these things until Act 2. Speaking of, Act 2's benches and bellways will have their prices reduced, too, so you shouldn't have to grind nearly as much—a welcome adjustment, given I kept having to go back to the ol' Songclave Grand Reed mines. All in all, some pretty conservative reducti…",

Yep, less than one week after release, and Silksong already has a multiplayer mod. Actually, it has two of them: SilklessCoop by nek5 and Silksong Steam multiplayer mod by XvX . Following in the footsteps of Hollow Knight multiplayer mods like HKMP , both these mods let you team up with a pal as you roam Pharloom. But before your head fills with visions of ganging up on bosses, some bad news: they both seem to be pretty much visual-only, at least for now. That is to say, you can have another Hornet hang out in your world (and vice versa), but I don't think you're gonna be taking on enemies together.

Enter Dave Plummer, an ex-Microsoft engineer whose other Windows contributions include Task Manager , native Zip file support, and Media Center, to name just a few (via The Register ). Speaking on his YouTube channel, Dave's Attic , Plummer revealed that when he ported the game to Windows NT from Windows 95, he wrote a whole new game engine around the original logic in order to handle the video rendering and sound. \"My game engine had a bug, in that it would draw frames as fast as it could\" said Plummer. At the time, the game was being coded on a MIPS R4000 processor running at a mighty 200 MHz, which resulted in the game running at 60-90 fps, a speed Plummer judged as \"plenty, for a game like that.\" \"Fast forward a couple of years later, somebody notices that o…",

Interpreting these shipping manifests from the NBD website is something of an art in itself. But short version is that there are entries for packaging for something listed as \"G31/C32\", where G31 is thought to be Intel's internal code for a new bigger GPU based on its latest Battlemage or Xe2 graphics tech, as used in the Intel Arc B580 cards you can (kinda) already buy.

Now, though, AMD has finally added the ability to enable FSR 4 in a bunch of games by flipping a toggle switch in the latest Adrenalin driver . The Adrenalin 25.9.1 drivers, AMD explains , enable FSR 4 in over 85 games: \"By updating your AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition driver, you automatically unlock access to this cutting-edge technology on your AMD Radeon RX 9000-series graphics card. Simply enable FSR 3.1 within the supported game and ensure the FSR 4 toggle is turned on from the AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition application.\" These titles are limited to ones that support DirectX 12 and FSR 3.1—more specifically, games that \"have integrated a signed FSR 3.1 DLL according to the guidelines in our FSR 3.1 documentation for developers .\" That doesn't include Vulkan games, unfortunately.

Tee Lopes, a videogame composer who's worked on Sonic Mania and Shredder's Revenge, to name a few, has released a remix of Sherma's lil' jingle. It sounds a lot like that style of saccharine European dance pop that was big in the '90s and early 2000s: music that resembles Saturday morning cartoons, but which is actually precision-geared for dancing to while high. Very high. Here it is. I like how Hornet nods out of rhythm in the accompanying video. Bugs will be bugs. Lopes has also done one for Shakra, whose banger sounds like something the Vengaboys might have released at the height of their inexplicable popularity.

Accept the Silver Bells quest and then enter the Bellhart Bellway fast travel station. At the bottom of the station, instead of heading left to where you call the Bellbeast, head to the right and break the secret wall to enter the lower bellvein, a claustrophobic sequence of tunnels below the town.

It feels like shooters are ready for a shake up, but at least in this instance, I think publishers ought to look toward the past to guide them. Before every shooter had a quick match button, server lists were how we got around. If modern matchmaking is a multi-lane freeway, reliably but plainly escorting players in and out of matches curated by developers, server browsers were the scenic route: finding a place you liked to play took more time, but the results were always more interesting . Server browsers were a boon for variety, but as we've learned in the years since their disappearance, they were also crucial tools of preservation.

And honestly, under the circumstances—the media didn’t get a head start here—that feels like the best way to go about playing and thinking about this curious game, which will likely delight or disappoint depending on your attitude going in. I really like it so far, but there are some things that annoy me about it, and I don't think it lives up to the hype through no fault of its own. I’m still not completely sure why Hollow Knight got as big as it did. I totally agree that it’s a great videogame and an outstanding metroidvania. Few games in this genre trust and reward the curiosity of the player as much as Hollow Knight did, and Silksong is no different in this regard. But this doesn't sufficiently explain its popularity.

Thankfully, those of us playing on PC have the tools at hand to redraw the line between \"challenging\" and \"excruciating\" in a more comfortable position. If Silksong's expecting more from you than you want to give, here's a pair of mods that can soften some of the sharpest pain points. (Image credit: TeamCherry) Quick disclaimer: Both mods require version 5.4.23.3 of the BepInEx plugin framework . To install it, grab the x64 .zip from the Github repo and extract to Silksong's installation directory. You'll need to run the game once to generate necessary config files. Then, to install either of the mods below, just place their associated .dll file in the /BepInEx/plugins folder in your Silksong directory. First target on the modding list is the corpse run, a common feature of the current Silksong difficulty discourse. It's less a problem of challenge and mor…",

This is far from a confirmation, though, and the original game's many ending permutations complicate the character's potential return. Asked if he'd be willing to reprise the character in Cyberpunk 2⁠—formerly codenamed Project Orion⁠—Reeves said: \"Absolutely, I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again.\" And that's it, that's all he said on the matter. But it's more than we had previously, and it also raises questions as to how CDPR could continue his story. A very remote possibility is reflecting Cyberpunk 2077 choices through Witcher or Mass Effect-style save importing, but that doesn't feel like a good fit. 2077 was a very personal, self-contained story, one where putting in that effort doesn't particularly feel worth it. That's also before you consider that we likely won't even see Cyberpunk 2 before 2030⁠—10 years after Cyberpunk 2077's release⁠—and that it'd be a pretty crazy ask to cut Keanu Reeves a check for content not all players will see.

Acutis was canonised in an ancient ritual led by Pope Leo, who himself has a good shout to be the first gaming Pope . The teenager's path to sainthood has been remarkably short: the campaign to have him canonised began six years after his death in 2012; he was decreed \"Venerable\" in 2018, \"Blessed\" in 2020, and now the Pope has formally declared Acutis a saint in St Peter's Square in Vatican City. Born in London, Acutis was still a baby when his Italian parents returned home, and he would spend the rest of his life in Milan. Acutis' family recalls him enjoying videogames including, of course, Halo, as well as the likes of Mario and Pokémon. He got a PlayStation when he was eight but, as a true servant of the Lord, restricted himself to one hour of play a day. It should also be said that Acutis was clearly a remarkable child.
