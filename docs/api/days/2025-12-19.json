As a big fan of the genre, I can confidently say that first-person dungeon crawlers harkening back to King's Field (or recent trendsetter, Lunacid) have reached that point. But the upcoming Queen's Domain deserves to be raised up from the crowd. We recently featured Queen's Domain in the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted showcase, and its aesthetics really caught my eye. Everything's all crunchy and dithered, but the art and assets are clearly gorgeous and well-crafted underneath⁠—we're very deliberately lo-fi here, not just 'cuz. In addition to the genre-standard medieval/renaissance gear and guys, Queen's Domain zags a bit by setting the game on a tropical island, with ancient, mossy stone ruins that call to mind Mayan cities or, in videogame speak, the Ruins of Rauh from Elden Ring. Maybe that one zone in Sonic 2 . The music is also killer, a euphoric, PS2-inflected sound cut with primal percussion and funkier instruments I can'…",

But it also seems to be awfully hard to do away with: A new Bloomberg report says Naughty Dog has been pushing employees to work at least eight extra hours per week since late October in order to finish an internal demo of its upcoming sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Intergalactic was revealed at The Game Awards 2024 with a long cinematic that landed (for me, at least) as kind of a mashup of Uncharted with Ready Player One, in space: Porsche-branded ship, Sony audio player, anime on the TV, and Pet Shop Boys on CD. Studio boss Neil Druckmann later said the game, despite its clear action trappings, is \" about faith and religion ,\" which is an interesting pitch, but we really haven't heard anything about it since.

I'm all for fighting fake creatures, of course—I wouldn't have spent a decade scrapping lizards for their parts in Monster Hunter otherwise. But sometimes it's just nice to look. Pokémon Snap did have a problem, however: Professor Oak thought it was fine to pay with exposure. No matter how many valuable shots of Pikachu I sent him, it didn't put any cash in my pocket that I might have spent on cool hats or shirts. Thankfully, there's finally a game willing to properly reward my talents in wildlight photography: Flock Around, a multiplayer photography game that brings friendslop a Peak-like experience to birdwatching. (Image credit: Secret Plan Games) After firing up the Flock Around demo on Steam and customizing my genre-standard colorful beanshaped avatar, I soon learned something about birds: They're harder to photograph than Pokémon.

Instead of basking in the glory of its first post- Baldur's Gate 3 project, revealed at The Game Awards as Divinity , the studio has been dealing with the ugly aftermath of Vincke's comments about the use of generative AI at Larian. In a new effort to set the record straight, Vincke said today that Larian will hold an AMA in the new year, giving gamers an opportunity to learn more about how developers at Larian actually get things done. Larian's AI controversy erupted earlier this week in the wake of a Bloomberg interview in which Vincke touched on some of the ways developers at the studio are making use of generative AI tools. He made clear that the studio isn't using generative AI for any in-game content, like art, writing, or voices, but that did little good: The backlash against what was perceived as Larian's pro-AI stance was immediate and fierce. Vincke tried to smooth things out with a subsequent post on X in which he was more specific about how exactly Larian developers use generative AI, but that did not satisfy many of the studio's fans.

The change comes as part of what appears to be a shakeup of gaming efforts at Hasbro, which has brought in industry veteran Paul Della Bitta to head up Wizards of the Coast's Digital Ventures division. Della Bitta spent 10 years across two stints at Blizzard, as well as two years as general manager of Riot Games in North America. More recently, he was a co-founder of Dreamhaven , the developer and publisher headed up by former Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime. But it's the departure of Ohlen that strikes me as the most notable development here, at least from a gamer's perspective. A 22-year BioWare veteran with lead design and director credits on everything from the original Baldur's Gate to Anthem, Ohlen took the wheel of a then-unnamed new development studio at Wizards of the Coast in 2019; Exodus, the studio's first project, was revealed at The Game Awards in 2023 . But just two years later, Ohlen is out. \"At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and …",

    "body": "Well, that didn't take long: Diablo 4 players have cooked up a completely automated build for the new paladin class that involves walking your dogs around while surrounded by a ring of fire. Never again will you need to burden yourself with pressing buttons once you get this build going as it's powerful enough to do everything in the game. Nobody has decided on an official name for it because it utilizes a bunch of different skills, but it's technically an \"auradin\" build like the ones you'd see during the days of Diablo 2. However, I propose that we start calling it the aura farmer build because the engine running everything is a holy aura that burns nearby monsters when you have a unique pair of gloves on. What's better than a single holy aura? 11 holy auras, obviously. In addition to surrounding your character, you can summon a pack of wolves and an ally mercenary who will inherit the aura too. Now, you have a whole team of aura farmers that leave a trail of ash in their wake. Outside of pushing into the high tiers of Diablo 4's hardest dungeons, this build only requires you to walk into enemies. There are buttons you can press to increase your damage, but they're optional. In …",

I use the inverted commas because, cute and cool as it was, the question of whether the rats were really playing Doom in any meaningful way, or just running on a ball for some delicious sugar water, was not conclusively answered. The project leader Viktor Tóth said at the time he wasn't happy with how they'd implemented the shooting response, and four years later the team is back with a new setup that significantly expands what the rats can do ( first spotted by Tom's Hardware ). And this time, the rodents are rocking a trigger mechanism. The first version had the rats suspended in a harness over a ball that rotated when they moved, with that movement mapped to a simplified version of a Doom corridor with an imp at the end. When the rat did the right things, it would get a reward in the form of sweetened water. The limitations meant that it was a bit of a stretch to say the rats were playing Doom, but as Tóth said you could make a decent argument they were \"kinda\" playing Doom. The new setup still maps the rat's real-world movement into a Doom environment, b…",

Maybe that's the best compromise: Blueprints have felt pretty stingy in Arc Raiders since launch. I've played for nearly 50 hours and haven't managed to find more than seven—to be fair, I'm not looking all that hard, but it's strange that other rare loot (like fancy guns and gadgets) are significantly easier to find than the blueprint for items that aren't even that good, like muzzle brakes. That was probably the aim of raising drop rates in the first place, though Embark never actually confirmed it raised them in the first place until today's hotfix.

Furthermore, 600 (or about 10% of all data centres) have been built in places that regularly breach that temperate 27 °C ceiling (via Tom's Hardware ). Data centres are already power hungry, collectively hoovering up 1.5% of the world's total electricity consumption (or 415 terawatt hours) in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency .

Nonetheless, over almost three decades of irradiated exploration, some standout missions have emerged. Most are potent displays of the genre's potential for reactivity—tales which allow for creative approaches, and multiple outcomes you'd never uncover without a spot of wiki-diving. Others are memorable simply because they're odd: creepy, daft or moving, written in a distinct tone that stands out against the green-grey backdrop of wasteland America.

Not because I didn't like them, but because I did.\" Goldfarb tells us that DICE pushed itself \"to do stuff maybe you wouldn't do if they were not there\".

Asus does point out on its security advisory page that although the problem is widespread and has a CVE rating of 7 (High severity), the vulnerability does require local access to the motherboard in order to gain access to the system RAM. The problem relates to the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) and add-on PCIe devices. The former has all kinds of protection mechanisms for direct memory access (DMA) operations, but Asus doesn't fully activate them on its Intel motherboards until just before the operating system is able to take over DMA protection duties. In other words, between first booting up the motherboard and the OS managing DMA operations, there's a window of opportunity for someone to use a PCIe device to gain access to system memory. That's obviously not a good thing, hence Asu…",

Parent company Monotype Imaging, which bought Fontworks back in 2023, then introduced a new pricing structure costing easily fifty times as much as the old plan (via Automaton ). US-owned Monotype's pricing structure initially offered no local pricing for Japan, but still expected devs to cough up $20,500 per year, in addition to agreeing to a ridiculous 25,000-user cap on games using the licensed fonts. Thankfully, the parent company has backpedalled a bit since, allowing developers to extend their licenses under the old affordable plan for the time being.

There is no jumping, no mantling, no attacking, no nothing, unless it can be achieved via the detonation of a bomb. When Ö starts with one bomb things seem simple enough: to jump, I spawn a bomb beneath myself and detonate. If I place a bomb and stand to the left of it before detonating, I'll be propelled leftward, which can be useful to clear a pit.

But the current design—a bit taller, a bit deeper—is far more suited to the task of keeping both high-end CPU and GPU combinations in check. While that does make the i600 a less compact gaming PC than the first iteration, it is a far more effective device because of it. And it's still pretty small if you compare it to most RTX 5080-based gaming PCs on the market. You can, of course, build out a small form factor mini-ITX machine in something like the Fractal Design Terra and have yourself a powerful micro machine, but it's not going to be able to get close to matching the cooling and aural design of the Corsair One. This thing is pacey, and this thing does it all with an understated grace you'll struggle to match with any compact DIY build. The key to that is the dual 240 mm AIO water cooling loops the Corsair One employs to keep its CPU and GPU components chill. There's a radiator in the top of the chassis that cools the graphics card and one in the side, which folds open, to look after the CPU…",

The publisher has become one of the most prolific—certainly within strategy and management games—with its recent releases including 9 Kings, Cataclismo, Endless Legend 2 and Manor Lords. It's also got good instincts: a significant number of its published games have gone on to be critical and commercial successes. Bender says that as he's scrolling through Steam, \"everything is designed to help me discover games\". I can find it hard to sift through the vast number of games released every month, but to be honest I can't fault the Discovery system: it's always spitting out stuff that's in my wheelhouse. And, to be fair, a lot that isn't. Instead, there's a problem with expectations, he reckons. \"Some people complain about the number of games released or wish for some kind of guaranteed exposure, but store platforms should welcome all entrants and let player preferences guide visibility.

I can't imagine playing Diablo 4 without sanctification, a new crafting system that is technically exclusive to the season but shouldn't be because it's almost perfect. It is responsible for dramatically improving the core loop of the game in ways I wasn't really expecting after playing with an unfinished version on the test server a few months ago. Sanctification is essentially a way to gamble with items for a chance at extraordinary outcomes. You take a piece of gear to a special forge and roll the dice to see what new bonuses are added to them. And those bonuses aren't always some extra strength or maximum life; they can add effects from the best items in the game. A forgettable pair of gloves can become the most powerful gloves you've ever worn, if you're lucky enough. This means every piece of loot is an opportunity for something amazing.

Justin Theroux, who plays Robert House (one of the apparently two Robert Houses that have appeared in the show so far) may have just tipped us off to an exciting upcoming Fallout: New Vegas cameo. The revelation took place on the \"Fake Fallout Talkshow,\" which you'll find hidden on Prime TV's Fallout show page on the \"Extras\" tab. It's a short talk show—a fake one—hosted by comedian and actor Jon Daly as his \"Snake Oil Salesman\" character, the shady vagabond best known for having sex with chickens and giving Thaddeus the elixir that ghoulified him. There's some real Between Two Ferns energy to the fake show, with the Snake Oil Salesman asking inappropriate or insulting questions: in one episode, he asks Ella Purnell how much money she makes, and repeatedly badgers her about what it's like being on Stranger Things, a show she does not appear on.

Sadly, it was not to be, and just five months after its 1.0 release, developer Theorycraft Games is pulling the plug. \"While the game has been out to the public for a little over a year, many of you have been playing with us for longer during our open prototyping phase,\" the studio explained in an FAQ . \"We're proud of the game that we built together, but ultimately we've been unable to capture the attention and excitement of enough players to sustain further development.\" In a video accompanying the closure announcement, Supervive executive producer Jenn Nam said \"a huge number\" of players had tried Supervive, but most of them stopped playing after a short time with it. That's left just a handful of die-hards still playing—currently a little over 200, according to SteamDB—which isn't enough to justify the expense of keeping Supervive running. That reaction …",

After that Unrecord went underground, as the two-man team began work on turning what was then a prototype into a full game.

    "body": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is PC Gamer's 2025 game of the year. No wonder. Warhorse's intensely particular historical RPG is already a classic: filled with great characters, a memorable plot, and like a thousand shopkeepers to rob blind in the night. It's also, says Warhorse co-founder and KCD2 executive producer Martin Klima, a sign of the times. \"This game is serious about taking players seriously,\" he told me in a recent chat, \"and I think we can see in the game industry in general, there is a [tendency] towards the games that offer this, kind of, more grown-up approach and offer less hand-holding. I think KCD really fits into that trend.\" (Image credit: Warhorse Studios) So Warhorse isn't surprised we loved KCD2 as much as we did. Klima says the \"deep gaming audience\"—I think that's you and me—is getting older and more experienced, more prone to venture out beyond the familiar. \"In general, I think you can only eat so much popcorn,\" said Klima, \"and once you discover that there is more rarefied food available, then you are no longer so keen on popcorn. So I think that certain audience tastes have evolved over the last 10, 15 years, and the successful games are testament to th…",

With Xbox Game Pass, I can take my game collection everywhere I go this season—here are six games I'll be spending the holidays with. Fallout 4 (Image credit: Bethesda Softworks) I devoured every episode of the Fallout TV series when it came out. After it wrapped up, all I wanted to do was head back into the Wasteland and explore to the dulcet sounds of The Ink Spots. Set in an irradiated Boston, you'll build settlements, kill Deathclaws, and befriend a cast of compelling companions, like our synth buddy Nick Valentine. To me, all of that is secondary to wandering the vast open world, discovering secrets and creatively placed skeletons. Fallout 4 might be 10 years old, but it's still a multi-award-winning game that puts you in an immense and varied world. As we said in our review , \"It'…",

When it comes to the computers that appear inside the games on your computer, do you know your stuff? For instance, could you identify a RoboCo Industries UOS desktop terminal on sight? Would you immediately recognize a Hock King 486 DX50? How about the Siefert InvestiMagic 6600 or the Karnak XOM? Let's find out! In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a PC that appears in a PC game. All you have to do is type the name of the PC game it's from, and you'll score a point. Need help? Click the hint button and it'll start revealing the game name, one letter at a time. We'll start out with some easy ones, but be warned, this one could get a bit tricky.

You can get away with that sort of thing when you've made what is basically the most popular indie videogame in the history of humanity.

That's per an interview with TheGamer , wherein Larian CEO Swen Vincke told the site that it's facing issues with \"the price of RAM and the price of SSDs and fuck, man. It's like, literally, we've never had it like this\". The problem is, it seems, the slow pace of game development—especially if you're Larian, you're going to be designing architecture for a game that'll be both simultaneously coming out in a few years but also releasing now, so figuring out a level of optimisation that's reasonable (while still making the thing look good) takes a bit of soothsaying. \"It kind of ruins all of your projections that you had about,\" he explains, \"because normally, you know the curves, and you can protect the hardware. It's gonna be an interesting one. It means that most likely, we already need to do a lot of optimization work in early access that we didn't necessarily want to do at that point in time.\" …",
