Known as “sensitive app protection,” this feature allows you to lock third-party apps without blocking access to the rest of the infotainment system. Because Google is releasing this as an unbundled app, it will be up to individual automakers to implement the feature in their vehicles. Unlike your personal Android phone , cars running Google’s Android Automotive OS are shared spaces. While the OS supports individual, PIN-protected user profiles to keep data separate, it currently lacks a way to lock specific apps. This creates a privacy loophole: If you unlock your profile just to let a passenger play music, they also gain access to all your other apps. Fortunately, that is set to change, as Google is introducing a native App Lock feature to Android Automotive. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Billboard JAPAN recently had the opportunity to talk to Amemiya and Scenarioart about what went into the creation of this web series and music. How did THE LENTICULARS come about in the first place? Akira Amemiya: As I got more and more used to professional animation production, I started to think about how I&#8217;d like to make something that would remind me of how it felt when I first started making anime. While I was working on it, someone I&#8217;d known introduced me to Scenarioart, and I asked them to write the theme song for me.

The list tallies the top 20 surging Vocaloid tracks on Japan&#8217;s video-sharing platform Niconico Douga by applying Billboard Japan’s proprietary weighting to data such as views, number of creations, comments and likes. In this article, songs using voice synthesizer software other than Yamaha’s Vocaloid products, such as CeVIO and Synthesizer V, will also be collectively referred to as “Vocaloid.” The Vocaloid song of the year this year is DECO27’s “Monitoring.” On the mid-year list, Hiiragi Magnetite’s “Tetoris” edged out DECO27’s “Monitoring” for the top spot by a slim margin. But momentum shifted when “Monitoring (Best Friend Remix)” dropped on Sept. 5, acting as a catalyst that propelled the original track to No. 1 for the year. At the inaugural edition of Japan’s largest international music awards, MUSIC AWARDS JAPAN 2025, Kurousa P’s “Senbonzakura” won Best Vocaloid Culture Song. Meanwhile, Asia Creators Cross – a global expansion of Niconico Chokaigi’s Creator Cross – launched in full in November 2024, further accelerating the export of Japan’s Vocaloid culture across Asia.

In a video of the try-on , Momsen, topless, with a white ruffled underskirt around her waist, gets help from stylist Lindsey Hartman in painstakingly sliding the red, white and green costume on over her arms. When the top finally slides over her head a voice off camera says, &#8220;oh my God! Stop!,&#8221; as Momsen smiles and laments that her arms are &#8220;too jacked&#8221; now to fit into the tiny sleeves she wore as a seven-year-old. After fussing around trying to get the costume up over her shoulders, Momsen, 32, decides to just let it rest on chest, with Hartman pinning it together in the back to make it a strapless number.

    "body": "TL;DR Multiple Pixel users report that their phones (including Pixel 8a, Pixel 9a, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10) have been failing to save some photos. These failures may happen after shooting a large number of photos in a short period of time. It’s not clear how widespread this issue is. We’ve reached out to Google for comment. Some Pixel phones are exhibiting strange behavior that’s been causing people to lose their photos. A handful of Reddit users have posted recently that pictures taken on their Pixel phones got “lost,” not appearing in local storage or backed up in Google Photos. A couple of months back, user Blazgamer posted on the r/GooglePixel subreddit that photos they’d taken on a trip failed to appear Pixel 9. Earlier today, user portmafia9719 described a similar experience on Pixel 10 Pro . It’s not clear what’s happening to these photos, but a common thread seems to be that the pictures turned up missing after a lingering notification that said photos were being processed in the background.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR Total Wireless is introducing postpaid-style free phone promotions and EIP device financing to the prepaid space. The catch is a 24-month repayment agreement tied to bill credits, effectively locking customers in long-term. It’s convenient upfront, but buying a phone outright can still be cheaper and more freeing, if you can afford it. All three major postpaid carriers are known for offering free phone promotions to new customers, so you don’t need to pay for a device up front. In reality, these “free” phones often cost much more in the long run than you would pay if you bought a phone outright and paired it with prepaid service. Still, many people would rather pay more over time than come up with a larger amount all at once. Until now, this practice was mostly unheard of in the prepaid world, but that’s beginning to change with Total Wireless . Not only is the company introducing a free phone offer that works similarly to those from the larger carriers, but it will also now offer comparable device repayment plans.",

That’s just what TCL has been pursuing with its NXTPAPER tech, and now the company is getting ready to introduce its latest tablet based on one of these panels.

    "body": "NASA/Aubrey Gemignani From left to right, CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen and NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Victor Glover, and Reid Wiseman stand outside before boarding their Orion spacecraft inside the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida as part of the Artemis II countdown demonstration test , Saturday, Dec. 20, 2025. Because the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket upon which they will launch is not yet at the launch pad, the crew boarded Orion inside NASA Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building, where engineers are conducting final preparations on the spacecraft, rocket, and ground systems. During the rehearsal, teams went through all the steps that will be taken on launch day, winding the clock down to just a few seconds before liftoff. Through the Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars, for the benefit of all. See more photos from the countdown demonstration test. Image credit: NASA/Aubrey Gemignani",

Nick Hague has retired from the agency, concluding a distinguished career that included two spaceflight missions, 374 days in space, and multiple spacewalks in support of the International Space Station. Hague continues service in the U.S. Space Force. Hague launched aboard the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft in March 2019 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for his first long-duration mission, serving as a flight engineer during Expeditions 59/60. During this 203-day mission, he conducted three spacewalks to upgrade the station’s power systems and support ongoing maintenance of the orbiting laboratory. Hague also contributed to a wide range of scientific investigations, spanning biology, human physiology, materials science, and technology demonstrations. Hague originally was assigned to fly in 2018 as part of the Soyuz MS-10 crew. The mission experienced a launch anomaly shortly after liftoff, and Hague and his crewmate executed a high-G ballistic abort. The two landed safely and Hague returned to flight status within months, ultimately completing his 2019 mission. He flew again during NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission, launching in Se…",

The feature was limited to tablets at first, but it soon expanded to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and other phones. Initially, I thought I would use this all the time, but I soon realized that the issue was with the multi-window mode itself, and how it displayed a tiny part of both apps and made using either of them clunkier. So I forgot about app pairs for a while, until Android 16 came along, and with it, a significant improvement to multi-window and split-screen multitasking on Android.",

The Galaxy A37 could get a welcome main camera upgrade but retain similar secondary cameras. Meanwhile, the Galaxy A57 might not deliver camera hardware upgrades. The Galaxy A36 and Galaxy A56 led the mid-range charge for Samsung in 2025, but we’ve already heard a few leaks about the Galaxy A37 and Galaxy A57. The latest leak has just outlined apparent camera specs. SmartPrix dug into leaked software and discovered purported camera details for the Galaxy A57 and Galaxy A37. Starting with the A57, the new phone is tipped to arrive with a Sony IMX906 main camera (50MP, 1/1.56-inch), a 13MP ISOCELL S5K3L6 ultrawide shooter, and a 5MP macro camera. The outlet explains that some regions might get the 50MP ISOCELL GNJ main camera instead, which has the same sensor size as the IMX906. A 12MP sensor (ISOCELL S5K3LC) will apparently handle selfies and video calls.",

Cargo launches arriving before special occasions often deliver Holiday Bulk Overwrapped Bags filled with foods like clams, oysters, turkey, green beans, and smoked salmon, along with shelf-stable treats such as candies, icing, almond butter, and hummus.&nbsp; Crew members exchange small gifts that float through the modules, add festive decorations around the station, and connect with loved ones through video calls. Astronauts also send holiday greetings to Earth, a reminder that even …",

As far back as the late 1950s, there were primitive numerical weather prediction (NWP) models that could produce an accurate (or what a forecaster would call “skillful”) forecast given a set of initial conditions. However, the data available to provide those initial conditions at that time were limited. For example, the weather balloon network circa 1960 only covered about 10% of the troposphere and did not extend into the Southern Hemisphere, the tropics, or over the ocean. Weather forecasters of the pre-satellite era typically relied upon manual analysis of plotted weather maps, cloud observations, and barometric pressure readings when ma…",

Original article, December 17, 2025 (6:00 AM ET): Google Maps is one of the most useful tools the company has ever created, and it’s all too easy to take what it offers for granted. Sure, we had stuff like MapQuest before it, but from basically the moment Google Maps arrived it started showing everyone else how mapping should be done. In the years since, its 3D imagery and first-person Street View photography have made distant corners of the world accessible in ways they never were before. And now, it looks like Google’s finally getting around to letting the Find Hub tap in to more of these fantastic Maps assets.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung released its second One UI 8.5 beta build today. The new beta restores Single Take and Dual Rec, two camera features that were missing in the previous build. Single Take and Dual Rec can be reenabled through the Camera Assistant app. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 beta that dropped earlier this month introduces plenty of small quality-of-life improvements , but mobile photography buffs weren’t pleased to see that it also removed a couple of niche camera app features, Single Take and Dual Rec. A second One UI 8.5 beta released today brings those features back, but makes them a little harder to access than they were before. SamMobile reports that the Single Take and Dual Rec camera modes are accessible in the second One UI 8.5 beta via the latest version of Samsung’s Camera Assistant app. Prior to One UI 8.5, the two modes were baked into Galaxy phones’ standard camera app.",

The Eden Switch emulator has just pushed out another substantial update, though extensive as it is, this one focuses on evolution rather than revolution. Version 0.0.4 is now live, bringing performance enhancements, game fixes, and expanded device support across Android, PC , and macOS. As detailed in the GitHub changelog , there is at least one new feature of Eden v0.0.4 you’ll probably notice right away. It now has an experimental overlay menu that works a bit like the real Switch. Once enabled, holding the Home button brings it up, making it feel more natural to jump into system-style options than to back out to the main app every time.",

We previously saw that this feature was in development in July, and it’s now rolling out broadly. Google’s made it even easier to find pictures of people in the Google Photos app. Photos has always offered an optional feature called Face Groups that groups similar faces together, creating automatically updating albums of all your pictures of any given person or pet, and today, Google announced that that feature is being more directly integrated into the app’s search functions. The change was quietly announced this morning by Google in a help forum post. Now, if you have Face Groups enabled, both Ask Photos and the app’s “classic search” feature prominently display a row of faces. Tapping any of the pictures in that row will take you to all the photos you have of that person or pet. We first caught a glimpse of this feature in an APK teardown back in July, and today, the change seems to be rolling out broadly.",

Turning my phone into a Nintendo Switch made it far more fun to play, and it made me swear off touchscreen controls for good. But a few years later, the limitations of telescopic controllers are really starting to grate on me. For starters, they’re not very portable. Early models, like the first Razer Kishi, folded up into a smallish square, but newer models all have the same H-shaped design that doesn’t pack up nearly as neatly. As my bag has slowly filled up with coloring books, crayons, cards, and other things to keep my kids entertained, bag space has increasingly come at a premium. Bulky telescopic controllers didn’t make the cut.",

The phone is expected to feature a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, positioning it below the recently launched OnePlus 15R. We’re unsure if the said phone is the Nord 6, the OnePlus Turbo, or any other. With the earlier-than-usual unveiling of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, followed by the less powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, we’ve already seen Android flagships lining up for global launch. Although Samsung is expected to delay its announcement of the Galaxy S26 series , OnePlus’ flagship, the OnePlus 15 , is already up for sale in global markets. The brand also recently followed up with the launch of the OnePlus 15R , much sooner than the typical launch cycle. Now, with the spare time on its hands, OnePlus is working on less premium options, and one of them is already emerging in leaks and may launch soon. Per fresh leaks, OnePlus is gearing up to launch yet another phone set for global markets. Leaker Abhishek Yadav recently posted on X and Instagram Threads that a OnePlus phone codenamed “Volkswagen” is under development.",

Early-bird pricing doesn’t usually disappear mid-preorder, but that’s what’s just happened with the Retroid Pocket 6. In a not-unfamiliar state of affairs for the industry, the company confirmed that it ended the RP6’s discounted pre-order pricing earlier than planned, citing a sharp increase in RAM costs. In a post on X , Retroid said it had intended to keep the Early Bird price through January. However, it has already burned through its initial memory supply, and replenishing stock now means paying “significantly higher prices.” With that, the company somewhat apologetically states it can’t sustain the discount.",

The device could closely resemble Apple’s rumored foldable iPhone in terms of size and shape. Unlike the tall Galaxy Z Fold 7, this model would prioritize stability and easier reading. Samsung is expected to launch it alongside its usual Fold, expanding its foldable lineup to three devices next year. The Wide Fold is also expected to feature 25W wireless charging. Samsung isn’t done experimenting with foldable form factors. After launching the Galaxy Z TriFold , rumor has it that the company is working on another foldable phone design, a wide one to counter Apple’s upcoming foldable iPhone. Now, a new report from South Korea’s ETNews has revealed more details about this new Samsung foldable and how it might compare to Apple’s competing device.",

I tend to dive deep into subjects with AI for short bursts that might last hours or on-and-off for a few days, and then drift away for weeks or more when life gets busy with things that are obviously more important. Slowly but surely, though, I realized I was doing less and less when it came to other personal interests. While my AI use never disrupted my real-life obligations or relationships, it was starting to cannibalize my hobbies. Recently, I started scrolling through my massive ChatGPT log entries. Some were simple entertainment, and others were deep thoughts that frankly got a bit heavy. There were more interactions than I’d ever care to count. That’s when the thought hit me: “Has this become my new doom scroll?” I started wondering how I got to that point, how much time I was wasting, and why it felt so addictive. Eventually, I took a deeper look at my AI usage patterns and then took a step back.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority OnePlus typically launches its flagship with an R-branded companion. The latter is characterized by slightly less impactful specifications, including a relatively dull display, a less appealing camera, or a generation-old processor. This year, however, the OnePlus 15R has earned a separate launch, independent of the OnePlus 15 ‘s shadow. That’s because the gap between the two phones is closing, as they share several features on their spec sheets, and these similarities help elevate the OnePlus 15R closer to the status of a flagship Android phone — even though it’s still a flagship-killer at heart . My colleague Joe Maring reviewed the OnePlus 15R and wasn’t quite convinced it is the appropriate update to the 13R, especially given the downgraded cameras, OxygenOS 16’s shift towards an iOS-like aesthetic, and a $100 price bump. While I don’t disagree, I view the OnePlus 15R as packing all the essential bits from the flagship 15, especially for those craving performance and longevity. And if you’re not looking for the swankiest of features, the OnePlus 15R may be worth your consideration.",

    "summary": "Google may finally bring back the separate Wi-Fi and mobile data toggles in a future Android release.",
    "body": "With the release of Android 12 back in 2021, Google made a somewhat controversial change to the Quick Settings panel. Gone were the individual toggles for Wi-Fi and mobile data. In their place was a new, expandable Internet tile that housed the old mobile data and Wi-Fi toggles. The change aimed to simplify things for users, but it had the side effect of making it more tedious to toggle Wi-Fi and mobile data. Years after rolling out this change, though, Google may be on the verge of reversing it in a future update to Android 16 .

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Android 16’s first major update made me fall back in love with Quick Settings. After Android 12 took away the smaller toggles and switched to the large pill-shaped buttons in the name of Material You, I started using Quick Settings less and less. See, any time a button is hidden away from my eyes and requires more than one or two swipes or taps, I just forget it exists. And this is what happened for me with Quick Settings on Android 12 to 15; I set up the ones I used the most up front and forgot about the rest. Android 16 QPR1 brought the ability to collapse each large pill into half its size and thus fit more toggles on one screen, and that’s what I immediately did. I now had more space to try new things with Quick Settings, like launch apps or start actions inside apps, but I blanked out for a while, not finding the right way to use the extra space. That is, until I realized that the action I needed the most is to control my smart home in general, and my standing desk in particular.",

Don’t get me wrong, Samsung phones are made in both of these countries, but the devil is in the details.
