So, Embark is doing things a little differently for its second Expedition project that departs on March 1. \"Starting off, we want to get one announcement out of the way right off the bat: we’ve heard your feedback about the required Stash value for maximum rewards being too high, and have decided to lower the requirement to three million Coins (600k per Skill Point),\" Embark wrote in blog post published today. \"The reward will still be five skill points for reaching the three million stash value.\" That's a big discount from the five million Coins that were needed to get the full skill point bonuses in the first Expedition—or a million coins per point. Yowza, now I understand the hate. To make amends with folks who tried and failed to complete the Expedition last time, Embark is also introducing a \"catchup mechanic\" that will allow players to earn last season's five skill points on the cheap: (I…",

The shooter has a couple animal heroes already: Winston, a super-intelligent gorilla, and Wrecking Ball, a mech piloted by a hamster named Hammond. On the other hand, as Reddit user mikoga points out , those heroes are protected by powerful mechanized armor. Jetpack Cat is 90% just-a-cat. \"I don't want to shoot at a normal ass cat,\" mikoga said. I hadn't really considered it before seeing that comment, but I might also not want to shoot at a normal ass cat, although there are some compelling rebuttals in the thread. Hammond may be protected by a mech suit, notes one commenter, but his little hamster body sometimes spills out of the cockpit when he's eliminated. The mech also explodes a fair bit, as I recall. That does make it hard to claim that Jetpack Cat is an aberration: Overwatch has been annihilating furballs for some time now. Other arguments boil down to 'you won't feel bad once she's annoying the hell out of you.' Jetpack Cat …",

It is, by every measure (well, except that movie ) an unmitigated success. And apparently, Chris Metzen, the executive creative director of the Warcraft universe, sometimes wishes it had a different name. This interesting spot of trivia came out of a recent Game Business interview with World of Warcraft vice president and executive producer Holly Longdale and game director Ion Hazzikostas (via GamesRadar ), in which Longdale expressed a desire to do more with Warcraft, beginning with broadening its appeal. \"It’s a fantastic IP,\" Longdale sale. \"In my humble opinion, it’s been underutilized and I just want to bring it to as many people as possible.

As reported by Game Developer , QA workers at Blizzard's Albany and Austin studios have ratified a union contract after almost three years of negotiating. That sounds like an awfully long time to me, but it seems to be the going rate for union contracts with Microsoft— Raven's QA workers also took three years to get theirs sorted. Fortunately, it all paid off in the end, because now 60+ workers are covered by the new agreement and it offers them a number of significant benefits. A statement provided by the Communications Workers of America—the union that represents the workers—confirms that the QA staff will have guaranteed wage increases; more regulations on AI and generative AI usage at work to ensure workers are supported, not replaced; protections on fair crediting; disability accommodations; immigrant worker protection; and restrictions on \"mandatory 'crunch time' or excessive overtime hours.\" All in all, this is…",

The Keychron K2 HE Concrete Edition looks very much like a regular, off-white coloured keeb, but the company sure has gone to town with its heavyweight base. It's also gone to town with the marketing copy, some of which I shall reproduce below: \"Smooth marble-like concrete shell seamlessly merges with cement gray keycaps,\" says Keychron. \"Each keystroke carries industrial rhythm, preserving the concrete's solid core while elevating the experience with marble-like smoothness and auditory-visual harmony.\" I'm not sure about all that, but I do like the idea of \"industrial rhythm\". Until today, I was fairly convinced it was a musical genre I wasn't entirely into—but hey, we all live and learn. The 75%-sized keeb features double-shot PBT keycaps, hot-swappable switches, 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth connections, and of course, a hefty concrete chassis.

The cushioned pads are spongy and airy, with enough padding, but not so much that you can't hit the frame with your finger with a press. The cups grip just enough to clamp onto the head without adding clamminess in the process. That comfort is enhanced by an adjustable headband sitting just below the plastic shell of the top of the headset. Unfortunately, that band only has two adjustable holes on either side, meaning there are only three adjustment settings total. That does mean if you have a particularly big head , you may find it a little tight. However, for me, I m…",

The world's most headline-friendly cryptocurrency dropped in value below $70,000 per coin on Thursday for the first time since 2024, with its losses overall this year totalling more than 20 percent. The reasons why are complicated, but famous hedge fund manager Michael Burry has some ideas. You know, the guy portrayed by Christian Bale in 2015's The Big Short . Burry took to his paid subscriber Substack page to declare that crypto was experiencing a \"collateral death spiral\", thanks to \"sky high leverage\" on crypto exchanges due to rising metal prices, which in turn meant that \"as the crypto collateral fell, the tokenized metals had to be sold\" (via Coindesk ). To understand what's happening here, I need to explain tokenised metals , so strap in. According to information I learned this morning (I have so little interest in crypto it's physically painful), tokenised metals are essentially blockchain representations of assets like gold, platinum and silver.

Roman Hartung who fronts the der8auer channel is also CEO of PC cooling specialist Thermal Grizzly. In that capacity, he's directly involved in buying 12 mm thick copper plates which are used via CNC manufacturing to produce items such as water cooling blocks for graphics cards. Hartung says he attempted to make a routine order for the plates back in October. Normally, the copper plates are shipped out within a few weeks of placing an order. But this time, he was told a price couldn't be confirmed and delivery would not be possible until February. Another supplier said they could deliver plates, but at a 40% higher price than before. Thermal Grizzly was paying around 190 euros per plate last year, with each plate enough to make four RTX 5080 GPU water cooling blocks. Today, he says the company would have to pay 280 euros per plate, potentially making the cooling block product non-viable. Hartung points out that in terms of market commodity pricing, copper has increased from $9,000 per tonne a year ago to an all-time…",

I was certainly expecting it to be something special, as I've been using the Audeze Maxwell on a daily basis, work and gaming, for just over a year (and our hardware overlord-in-chief Dave has been using his set for even longer). Or rather, just like Audeze, I was hoping it would be better, because as much as I really like the Maxwell, there are a few things that really annoy me about it. Let me just cut to the chase, then: Taking all things into account, the Audeze Maxwell 2 isn't unreservedly better than the first-generation Maxwell. It's improved in some areas, but it's regressed in others (or just not improved), and given that it's a little bit more expensive, it's hard to recommend that you buy the Maxwell 2 instead of the original Maxwell. However, if you browse through Audeze's store, you'll notice this has all been made somewhat moot because the OG Maxwell is now mostl…",

In an email interview with PC Gamer, Nioh 3 director Masaki Fujita said the threequel incorporates lessons learned from the ARPGs Koei Tecmo has released since Nioh 2. But Nioh 3 wasn't only informed by Team Ninja's own work. According to Fujita, Neowiz's Pinocchio soulslike Lies of P was a source of creative inspiration for Nioh 3's boss and combat design. (Image credit: Koei Tecmo Games) When asked how player reactions to Koei Tecmo's recent soulslike and ARPG releases influenced Nioh 3, Fujita said 2023's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty underscored that, while loot is a key part of Nioh's appeal, \"there's a need to control the complexity of the game.\" Likewise, he noted that some players felt the relationship between Wo Long's protagonist and their counterpart in the Blindfolded Boy was underdeveloped, leading Team Ninja to \"go into more depth\" with how co…",

I'm also one of those pretentious gits that thinks videogames don't have to be fun to be worth making or playing, though. Very much in the 'it's the point' camp is game director of Nioh 3 Masaki Fujita, who spoke with Eurogamer on the subject this week. In case you're unfamiliar, Nioh 3 is a soulslike action game with an emphasis on skill expression and difficulty. As contributor Lewis Parker puts it in his Nioh 3 review , it has a \"far more fine-tuned and in-depth approach to combat\", more Sekiro than Elden Ring. But that's getting into the weeds a little bit: Point is, it's a bit hard. Fujita tells the site that \"We've never considered adding difficulty settings to the Nioh series.

Though the Superstrike goes one further with haptic feedback, too. I got my hands on the mouse recently and I'm really impressed . However, it's not a cheap thing. It's set to launch on February 10 for $180 / £160 , which is even a little more expensive than the very expensive Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro , the best gaming mouse currently on the market. And given the Superstrike is aimed at competitive gameplay, I do worry that the advantage it gives might be restricted to only the very few who can afford it. Thankfully, though, while visiting its Swiss labs, Logitech helped somewhat quell my concerns on this front. Of course, the price tag for the Supestrike is what it is, but this is bleeding-edge tech, and it will hopefully become cheaper to implement, or be used in cheaper products in time.

This is a particularly handy metric given that one of the best known existing trackers of OLED burn-in by Monitors Unboxed has been based on a monitor with a Samsung QD-OLED panel . Now we have something similar for LG WOLED. For context, Optimum has been using an LG UltraGear 32GS95UV monitor for a wide range of uses, from gaming to content creation. I think it's a pretty much identical 4K model to the LG UltraGear 32GS95UE I reviewed here , complete with 1080p dual-mode. It's said the panel has been set to between 80% and 100% brightness depending on the time of day.

The company announced the mouse late last year and since then I've been really excited to try it out, because I'm always on the lookout for something—other than diligent practice—that might improve my Counter-Strike 2 K:D ratio and headshot percentage, as well as my general performance in other shooters. The mouse uses what Logitech is calling a Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS), ie, a mix of haptic feedback and inductive tech for the LMB and RMB switches.

Looking deeper into the fiscal results themselves, YouTube ads brought in $11.38 billion in the last quarter, compared to $10.47 billion in last year's report. Anecdotally, I can well believe this figure, as YouTube's ad frequency ramped up at such a rate towards the end of 2025 that I finally caved and bought a YouTube Premium subscription myself. Speaking of which, while Alphabet doesn't report YouTube Premium's revenue individually, it has declared that the company now has \"over 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services, led by strong adoption for Google One and YouTube Premium.\" On the surface, YouTube's revenue figure seems impressive—but its viewing figures are even more so. According to CEO Neal Mohan in his 2026 YouTube community letter , YouTube Shorts alone average out to 200 billion daily views.

Let's assume this is true and Rinascimentale of Reddit did indeed pay a shade over $560 for an Nvidia RTX 5080 . How, exactly, does this make sense? Apparently, the price reduction on the RTX 5080's box is a CVP or Customer Value Program sticker. According to various online discussions, CVP pricing is most commonly used for perishable goods that are about to go out of date. Reportedly, they can also be used for in-store returns of online purchases that aren't otherwise stocked. There are also indications that some of these prices may be auto-generated by an algorithm and applied to \"open box\" products that have been hanging around on store shelves. In other words, the algorithm just keeps cutting the price until the thing sells. Redditors who claim to be present or past Walmart workers claim that such discounts can often be the result of a ruse by employees who apply the CVP discount with the…",

Her ult is very good, and has a very short cooldown. As soon as you get her ult in the early game, you can start going ham on people.

Nioh 3 —perhaps in response to Elden Ring, or perhaps reflecting Team Ninja's own foray into open worlds with Rise of the Ronin—has pivoted away from the structure of its predecessors and embraced openness, with a handful of densely packed and massive maps primed for exploration. I found it impossible not to make mental comparisons to Elden Ring as I slaughtered yokai or fell to their savage attacks.

Van Buren's the mythic could-have-been that almost-was, a Fallout RPG that would have had everything we loved about the first two games in it and none of the stuff we didn't love about the Fallout 3 we eventually got. Because it never got made it can stay perfect in our imaginations, never having to live up to reality. That doesn't stop modders from wanting to make it real in their own ways, though. There's a mod to recreate Van Buren in Fallout 2's engine called Fallout Yesterday , and a project that's supposedly remaking the whole game as it would have been . However, since a bunch of ideas from Van Buren were eventually re-used in Fallout: New Vegas—like Caesar's Legion, the Big MT, and Joshua Graham—you can see why there would be an advantage in remaking Van Buren as a mod for the game that already has some of the relevant assets.

By the time the 3DS remake came around the one and only thing I knew for sure about the game was that, whatever I happened to play it on, it was long. Really long. Somewhere around \"You've got to be kidding me\" long. At the time of writing, the average rushed completion time for the main story on Howlongtobeat is comfortably over the 60 hours mark. And the honest truth is, I just didn't want to play a game that long that badly. I already have plenty of other, shorter Dragon Quest games to play, and my shelves and Steam library are filled with RPGs famous for being complex, engaging, exciting… basically anything other than ridiculously time consuming. But what if Square Enix reimagined the game? What if they took the whole thing apart and rebuilt it from the ground up?

Another 59% of no-AI respondents said they're not interested in embracing the tech because of privacy concerns—very valid—while 43% simply aren't interested in paying more to have the tech on their devices, most commonly smartphones. Only 15% of respondents said they weren't interested in AI-enabled devices because the technology seems too complicated. That seemingly puts the lie to the idea that consumers are rejecting AI because it hasn't been explained to them clearly enough, presumably slowly and with small words.

Nioh 3 is more frenetic than Nioh 2, which was more frenetic than Nioh. Team Ninja's project feels akin to id Software's approach with Doom Eternal: no finger can be permitted to rest. It's a project in pushing against the limits of player exhaustion. After 20 hours I still don't understand all the systems in Nioh 3, but there's one I'm already super familiar with from past Nioh games: pressing RB to perform a \"ki pulse\" after every attack. This replenishes a bit of \"ki\" (which is basically stamina) and also cleans up all the black murky mess enemies leave around which can severely handicap your damage output.

Nesmith is asked at one point about the debate over $100 games, which has been going on for years now but feels especially acute in the year of our lord Grand Theft Auto 6, which some expect to set a new premium price point. The argument is that spiralling budgets and the relatively steady price of games over the years makes such an increase inevitable , and perhaps even essential to the industry's future well-being. \"I remember for 15 years, the price of a newly released game was $59.95,\" says Nesmith. \"For 15 years, it didn't change.

A rough pre-release led into an even worse launch: Player counts on Steam were microscopic, layoffs at developer Build a Rocket Boy followed, and the whole thing was clearly, incontrovertibly, and utterly cooked . And yet. Somehow, here we are with a new update, and a promise of even bigger things to come. As Benoit Blanc famously said, \"It makes no damn sense. Compels me, though.\" \"After months of continued post-launch support following player and critic feedback, the title receives its most significant post-launch update yet, achieving the studio's vision for quality and setting the stage for exciting future content updates,\" BARB said in today's press blast.

The reason, as Blizzard explained to PC Gamer and other press attending an event at its offices in Irvine last week, is all about the development team's confidence in Overwatch's future. Starting next week, Overwatch is going to look a lot different—literally, with a new UI, five new heroes, and the kick off of a whole new storyline. Its 21st season—coming February 10—will instead be known as season 1 of The Reign of Talon, a year-long narrative that will be told through in-game events, cinematics, short stories, and comics. It's a season that game director Aaron Keller calls \"the biggest launch we've ever had in Overwatch's history.\" To communicate how much of a shakeup this new era of Overwatch will be, the 2 had to go, franchise general manager and head of live service and mobile games Walter Kong said. \"Something that we've talked about internally at the team as a stretch goal …",

What I saw was way more than I ever could've imagined, to the point the words \"soft reboot\" came to mind. It isn't quite that, mind you, but it's easily the biggest update the game has ever had and a marked shift in the vision of what it could be. Starting next week on February 10, Overwatch 2 will drop the 2 and launch the first season of a year-long storyline called The Reign of Talon. Vendetta, the gladiator woman who was recently released as a hero , has taken over the terrorist organization at the heart of Overwatch's near-future story, and the rest of 2026 will explore the fallout of her coup. To tell that story, Blizzard has five (five!) new heroes ready to go: Tank hero Domina, damage heroes Anran and Emre, and support heroes Jetpack Cat and Mizuki. Another five heroes are coming before the end of the year at a rate of one per season. All of them will figure in the narrative—via in-game events, short stories, comics, and cinematics—before the arc wraps up and a new storyline begins in 2027. Game dir…",

The most significant covers AMD's adoption of Intel's so-called 'FRED' interrupt handling. It's a change that implies that Zen 6 could be a major architectural overhaul as opposed to a relatively minor revision. FRED stands for Flexible Return and Event Delivery. At least, that's what it stands for now. No lesser an authority than Linux creator Linus Torvalds has something to say about that, more on which in a moment. It's a replacement for the decades-old IDT or Interrupt Descriptor Table that dates way back to the Intel 286 processor circa 1982. Both FRED and IDT are instructions for how to handle system events, such as a mouse input or the arrival of a network data packet, also known as interrupts. The technicalities are complicated . But to aggressively simplify the subject, with IDT, the smooth handling of these system events requires software developers to manually manage interrupts over several steps to minimise the risk of multiple interrupts conflicting with each other.

There’s no denying that FromSoftware is the king of the genre, but as far as I’m concerned, Nioh 2 deserves a spot on the Mount Rushmore of soulslikes, nestled between Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring. Don’t get me wrong, it’s got its problems. Certain mechanics are a touch obtuse, and you’ll end up traipsing through the same maps at least three times to complete side quests, but that’s easy to handwave when its combat is a head above almost every other soulslike. (Image credit: Koei Tecmo Games) Still, given the improvements between Nioh and Nioh 2, I couldn’t help but feel optimistic about Nioh 3. This is Team Ninja’s third swing at perfecting its own specific formula of action-focused soulslike, and it was already so close with Nioh 2. So has it done it? Is …",

But Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone doesn't seem to think he's all that of an advanced developer either. Something I found mighty interesting when reading through his interview with IGN for the game's 10-year anniversary is that he still very much thinks of himself as \"a total amateur.\" (Image credit: ConcernedApe) When talking about transitioning from solo development to working on the game with a team, Barone credits his fellow coworkers for their \"unique sensibilities\" and being able to do \"so many things I couldn't have done on my own\" like translating the game into multiple languages and introducing multiplayer. \"There's some technical things that are just beyond my skill level,\" he said. \"I'm a very amateur developer.
