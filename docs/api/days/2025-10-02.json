Death to Chronos. Supergiant's first hotfix for version 1.0 is out now, and it's mostly a lot of minor fixes for issues like \"Olympian Keepsake effects not activating again after their Boon is skipped\" and \"Fated List Prophecies related to Hidden Aspects not clearing in specific circumstances\". I suspect some rebalancing will follow these patches, but right now one miniboss has been hit with a super specific nerf and I'm glad of it: \"Fixed Phantom (Fields) being able to drain Life from your raised servants\". A couple of the minibosses in Hades 2 present as much challenge as the Guardians who act as each zone's bigger final boss, and the Phantom sure is one of them. This life-stealing mongrel heals after attacking you and isn't easy to dodge, especially when surrounded by allies and the flashy visual effects a typical fight in Hades 2 is accompanied by. This was made even harder if you'd selected the moon goddess Selene's hex that lets you raise the last enemy you killed to fight on your side. Setti…",

Scrolling Steam reviews is a great way to see what people are happy about, furious about, or sometimes just have a little chuckle. Steam reviewers can get pretty creative, too. A review on PC Gamer can contain a thousand words (often, quite a lot more), but sometimes a Steam reviewer can sum up a game in just a sentence or two, almost like poetry.

Professional raiders and casual players alike have relied on combat addons to assist them with the MMO's endgame dungeons for decades. But starting in Midnight, they'll have to rely on the default UI and their knowledge of the fights. Wowhead attended a group interview with game director Ion Hazzikostas and UX designer Crash Reed where they were asked about addon support going forward. Hazzikostas didn't explicitly say when addons will go away, but his answers imply it will happen in the final patch before Midnight launches. Hazzikostas said a blog post for addon authors is coming \"in the next day or two\" that will explain how some combat information will be stored in a black box of sorts, preventing addons from accessing it. \"The UI and addons can know that box exists, they can display info…",

If the deal earns shareholder and regulator approval, it'll be the largest leveraged buyout in history—and it's already inspiring dread in fans and EA developers alike. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) To understand why the buyout news seems dire to so many, we first need to understand private equity and what exactly a leveraged buyout entails. The PIF, meanwhile, is its own troubling wildcard. Since 1990, EA has been a public company: Like other publicly traded businesses, its ownership—or equity—has been determined by the distribution of shares of capital stock that are bought and sold through stock exchanges. Being a publicly traded company offers advantages, the most obvious being the ability to raise funds by selling shares of stock. But public companies have their disadvantages, too—particularly for consumers in creative and entertainment industries. Shareholder primacy, the theory that deliveri…",

In an announcement reminiscent of Phil Spencer's comments about how great things are looking at Xbox as the company laid off 9,000 people , the Xbox team said \"creator participation and player engagement in Game Pass are at an all-time high.\" But, it continued, \"we have the opportunity for Game Pass to help more players find the creators and games they love.\" \"We know not everyone wants the same thing in their Xbox experience, so we’re evolving Game Pass to offer more flexibility, choice, and value to all players, whether you love day one releases, discovering hidden gems, or playing across multiple devices and screens and across Xbox consoles, Xbox on PC, and Xbox Cloud.\" That evolution means two things.

Jayden Griffin, who is 19 years of age, was indicted by a grand jury in December 2024 over electronic communications sent to Epic Games staff between October 24, 2024, and November 9, 2024. Griffin pleaded guilty to \"threatening interstate commerce\", a charge brought because Epic Games is headquartered in North Carolina, and could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in federal prison, fined up to $250,000, or a combination of the two. Even should he avoid jail or get a minimal sentence, he faces up to three years of supervised release. Those are some potentially life-changing penalties, and should certainly give a certain breed of keyboard warrior pause for thought. A court document filed on September 16, 2025, contains the following statement from Griffin: \"I sent messages to Epic Games, where I threatened to kill employees of the company. I intended for the messages to be viewed as a threat at the time that I sent the messages.\" In a hearing on September 29 at the US District Court of South Dakota, Griffin entered…",

So I was pretty interested in Hotel Barcelona, a 2.5D action roguelite that emerged—like Athena from Zeus' skull—from a hot collabo between the two creators. And then I stopped being quite so interested: reviews weren't great—the game currently stands at a 56% Mixed user rating on Steam, and critics weren't in love with it either. Now, in another blow to my interest Hotel Barcelona has updated its Steam page to feature an AI disclaimer. The disclaimer bashfully admits that \"VHS tapes can be found in the late stages of the game that use voice overs from an AI text to speech service\" and that \"A logo is featured on these tapes that has utilised generative fill AI to complete the image.\" In an update published earlier today , Hotel Barcelona publisher CULT seemed pretty abashed by the wh…",

With the likes of TSMC (the world's largest semiconductor fabrication company) being based there, it's right at the centre of the global chip trade. With America also looking to regain a slice of that technological pie, that has led to some chatter about potential deals between the two countries. As reported by Reuters , US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told News Nation (a US-based television network) that it would be proposing a 50/50 split with Taiwan for future chip production. In this, the US government wants Taiwan to move 50% of the chips it produces for US use to be made in the US. TSMC has fabs in America, newly-built ones with plans for more, but they don't make up anywhere near as much of global production as its facilities in Taiwan. This proposed deal would try to push for commitment to a huge increase in production on US soil. Cheng Li-chiun, a Taiwanese politician and vice premier, told reporters, \"Our negotiating team has never made any commitment to a 50/50 split on chips.

In place of that, it'll be adding its own increasingly-comprehensive suite of tools, such as a cooldown manager, buff tracker, and a more customisable personal resource bar. But one lingering thought has been rattling around in the back of my head: is Blizzard just swapping out one arms race for another? If we take Final Fantasy 14 , for example, user interface AddOns are completely against the terms of service—and in common enough use that they routinely scupper World First races . During a group interview in a recent summit for the expansion, I asked game director Ion Hazzikostas whether or not Blizzard was concerned about AddOn authors simply creating third-party tools that go against the terms of service anyway. After all, if you draw a line in the sand, there's gonna be people who walk over it. Hazzikostas was remarkably collected about the idea, though: \"We've approached this in a couple …",

I've written about the Asus x Hatsune Miku collaboration before, which already includes themed monitors, motherboards, and much more besides. Now, the range is set to expand and will soon offer a decidedly dear graphics card for sale; the new Hatsune Miku edition of the ROG Astral Geforce RTX 5080 O16G is apparently set to cost $1,900 (via Videocardz ).

Now you can try it for yourself—the game's first public demo is out on Steam now . (Image credit: Tribute Games Inc) It's pretty much the same stuff as I got to play earlier in the year, barring a few tweaks and some updated menus. That means you can play through two levels in arcade mode—the streets of NYC and the SHIELD helicarrier—with nine playable characters, including favourites like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine. It's a pretty brief taste, but it gives you a great idea of what the final game is going to be like—and I recommend replaying the two levels a few times with different characters to see just how far developer Tribute Games has pushed the different movesets. From Venom warping into different grotesque forms to Rocket Raccoon throwing grenades all over the map, they all play completely differently—and frankly it's worth playing them all just to see all the gorgeous pixelart animations.

Not just with the inner turmoil that new protagonist Hinako Shimizu faces, but also with the setting, puzzles, and monsters that you face.

For a start, it's got such a neat integrated desktop stand, it's kind of astonishing to me that I haven't seen something like it before. Essentially, the SoloCast 2 comes as what appears to be one cylindrical unit with two boom arm screw mounts integrated into the bottom (⅜-inch and ⅝-inch, if you were wondering), making it seem like a standard, stand- less, microphone design. Break it apart like a shotgun breech, though, and it opens to reveal a hidden hinged base roughly one fifth of the way up its frame. It's a robust hinge, too, which means it's weighted enough in its movement to stay at exactly the angle you set it at in a desktop position, with plenty of mass at the bottom to prevent it from accidentally tipping over.

But, you won't just be able to walk up to it and harvest honeycomb like you're using a chest. Here's what you need to do instead.

But, rather than any old nest, you're looking for one that has already been pollinated and is filled with honey . This is indicated by the spots on the side of the hive, which are usually brown and dark, appearing golden and honey coloured.

The clip (embedded above) shows Call of Duty pro Simp using one of Blops 7's new killstreak rewards, The Gravemaker, a sniper rifle whose wielder can see, and snipe, through solid walls. The go-to joke is that Activision has given up on combating cheaters and decided to just put wallhacking into the game. I sort of get the indignation, because it doesn't look fun to be on the receiving end of a bullet that was fired through two layers of concrete by someone you never could've seen, but I also sort of don't get it, because aren't all Call of Duty killstreaks like that? How is this less fair than someone calling in an attack helicopter or carpet bombing part of the map? In some of these games you can call in a tactical nuke. A nuclear bomb!

It's a book about the mud and muck of its medieval world, one that jams its characters into moral quagmires as well as physical ones.

The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmö and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs.\" This will be Avalanche's third studio closure in just over a year: In June 2024 Avalanche closed its offices in Montreal and New York , putting roughly 50 people out of work. A studio representative declined to say how many people are being let …",

The game is \"content complete,\" The Game Bakers clarified, but developers want to take a few extra weeks \"to focus on optimization, debug, and polish.\" \"Our goal has always been to create games you remember long after playing them, and for Cairn, despite our best efforts, this requires a little more time,\" the studio wrote. \"We've been running a lot of playtests, and you've let us know that we have something truly special with Cairn. Still, we also see the improvements we can still make to give you the best game we can.

Expectations are high for Judas, but it also has to be said that it looks a hell of a lot like another Bioshock game . In a new interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, Levine talks a little more about Judas and the similarities to his previous work: but insists it's got a whole lot more going on than plasmids and wrenches. \"There are parts of Judas that are more similar to BioShock, and there are parts of Judas that are really, really radically different,\" said Levine. \"I'm sure people notice there's a gun in one hand [and] powers [in] the other hand.

Throw in a bit of redstone, and I'm happy observing others' creativity safely within the confines of my hardware writing lane. One YouTuber called sammyuri has shared an especially extreme Redstone build, building ChatGPT in Minecraft (via Techspot ). Dubbed CraftGPT, this version of the Large Language Model is decidedly compact as far as these things go, featuring only about 5 million parameters (as that's all the creator's \"poor old laptop\" could handle). However, translating that into Minecraft blocks took up a considerable amount of space. Featuring 439 million blocks, this build required the Distant Horizons mod to keep everything on screen and operational. Beyond that, sammyuri claims that this build was made using only vanilla Minecraft's own redstone mechanics.

As reported by The Verge , three laptops are launching under the Energizer name, each designed by Avenir Telecom, a French communications company: The Energizer EnergyBook Pro 15, the EnergyBook Pro XL 19, and the Energizer EnergyBook Pro Ultra. The last is considered the flagship model and comes with a whopping 18-inch display (with a 1920 x 1200 resolution). The Pro Ultra comes with a 192 Wh battery. For context on this figure, of all the batteries we've tested lately, the absolute max capacity we've found is 175 Wh on the likes of the Acer Predator Helios 18 AI or Razer Blade 16 . Both of these laptops have RTX 5090s and cost thousands of dollars. Those bigger batteries are an attempt to get normal battery life out of high-end hardware. The Pro Ultra, however, comes equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, and 512 GB of SSD storage. You don't need a huge battery to get decent battery life…",
