    "summary": "Billboard looks at Gavin Adcock's various recent and ongoing beefs.",
    "body": "Gavin Adcock released his first songs back in 2021, but over the past year, he&#8217;s hit a new career high, thanks to his album Own Worst Enemy . The August-released set debuted at No. 4 on Billboard &#8216;s Top Country Albums chart and at No. 14 on the all-genre Billboard 200 . Adcock also earned a string of RIAA gold and platinum-certified songs this year. But beyond music accolades, the Warner Music Nashville-signed Adcock has been in plenty of headlines, for reasons outside of music.

This change addresses inconsistent home screens, as many developers currently opt out of providing a themed icon for branding or design reasons. To enforce this, Google updated its Play Store policy today, requiring developers to legally grant users the right to modify their app icon’s color. App icons rarely look similar unless they were designed by the same person or company. This makes them easy to distinguish from one another but can also leave home screens looking messy. To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme. Support for this feature is currently opt-in, and many developers choose not to participate for various reasons. However, thanks to upcoming changes in the Android OS and Google Play, developers will no longer be able to prevent their app icons from being themed. Currently, developers have to supply a monochromatic version of their app icon for Android to theme. This isn’t a huge technical undertaking, but there are sev…",

These users will also be able to play a song shared by a friend or artist. Spotify has long been focused on improving the Premium experience. For example, Premium members recently started gaining access to lossless audio, a feature that many have been waiting for. Now it’s finally time for free users to get a little something. The service is now giving non-paid subscribers more control. If you’re a free user of Spotify, you’ll now be able to play any song you want to listen to. The company is calling this new feature “Pick &amp; Play.” There’s also “Search &amp; Play,” which allows free users to search for a song and start listening instantly. And if a friend or artist shares a song, you’ll be able to listen right away with “Share &amp; Play.”",

NASA/GSFC/Solar Dynamics Observatory It looked like the Sun was heading toward a historic lull in activity. That trend flipped in 2008, according to new research. The Sun has become increasingly active since 2008, a new NASA study shows. Solar activity is known to fluctuate in cycles of 11 years, but there are longer-term variations that can last decades. Case in point: Since the 1980s, the amount of solar activity had been steadily decreasing all the way up to 2008, when solar activity was the weakest on record. At that point, scientists expected the Sun to be entering a period of historically low activity. But then the Sun reversed course and started to become increasingly active, as documented in the study , which appears in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. It’s a trend that researchers said could lead to an uptick in space weather events, such as solar storms, flares, and coronal mass ejections. “All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity,” said Jamie Jasinski of NASA’s Jet Pro…",

    "body": "One of the challenges many teachers face year after year is a sense of working alone. Despite the constant interaction with students many questions often linger: Did the lesson stick? Will students carry this knowledge with them? Will it shape how they see and engage with the world? What can be easy to overlook is that teaching does not happen in isolation. Each classroom, or any other educational setting, is part of a much larger journey that learners travel. This journey extends through a network of educators, where each experience can build on the last. These interconnected networks, known as Connected Learning Ecosystems (CLEs), exist wherever learning happens. At their core, CLEs are the collective of people who contribute to a young person’s growth and education over time. Educators at the August 2025 Connected Learning Ecosystems Gathering in Orono, ME engaged in discussion around using NASA data in their learning contexts. Recognizing this, NASA’s Science Activation Program launched the Learning Ecosystems Northeast (LENE) project to strengthen and connect regional educator networks across Maine and the broader Northeast.

Multiple Android Auto users are reporting on Reddit that the media player has recently lost its color. While the rest of the display is fine, the media player window now looks washed out. Not only does the lack of contrast look bad, but it also makes it difficult to read any white text in the window.

Unlike the Galaxy S25 Ultra or the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the 200MP sensor will be used for the OPPO Find X9 Pro’s telephoto camera. The 200MP sensor should allow the OPPO to reduce the number of telephoto cameras on Find X9 Pro to one, as opposed to two on its predecessor. Android phone makers constantly engage in number games to boast improvements over previous generations and as compared to the competition. Phone cameras, with their ever-evolving megapixel counts , especially take center stage in this rivalry, as brands continually vie to outdo one another. Recently, 200MP has been the current gold standard for cameras on flagship Android phones. Samsung has adopted it for the primary cameras of its top-end phones, such as the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 Edge , and most recently, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . Meanwhile, Vivo has reserved a 200MP sensor for its telephoto camera, and another brand is about to follow suit.",

    "body": "TL;DR Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max provides more transparent marketing than most other fast chargers. The charger’s branding differentiates between sustained power (40W) and peak power (60W). It supports the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, a step toward more open charging solutions, unlike many proprietary Android chargers. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",

    "body": "TL;DR Pixel 7 and 7 Pro users are reporting battery swelling issues, with mixed responses from Google support. Google recently offered free battery replacements and cash/discount appeasements for Pixel 7a swelling problems. Battery troubles have plagued several Pixel models, including Pixel 6a units catching fire, raising pressure on Google to respond. Pixels are among the best Android phones you can buy, but they have also earned a notorious reputation for battery troubles. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro now appear to be the latest devices hit by these problems, with owners reporting swelling batteries on Google’s support forums. “I am writing to report a serious issue with my Pixel 7 Pro, which I purchased approximately two years ago. Recently, I noticed that the side panel of the device has started to separate, as clearly shown in the attached photo. Upon closer inspection, it appears the battery may be swelling, posing a significant safety risk, including the potential for explosion or fire,” a user noted on Google’s support forums . The thread now has several complaints from other Pixel 7 and 7 Pro users who are also experiencing battery swelling issues on their devices.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR An Android Authority teardown has uncovered just how Quick Share will work for iPhones. Android owners can share a QR code with iPhone users to let them download files. However, files shared with iPhone users via Quick Share will first be uploaded to the cloud and retained for 24 hours. We’ve known since last year that Google is working on bringing Quick Share to iOS and MacOS . We recently discovered more evidence of the feature coming to iPhones , as well as hints that senders would need to sign in to their Google account. At the time, we weren’t sure how this would all work. But it now looks like we have an answer. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

When YouTube TV initially launched in 2017, the service cost just $34.99 each month — an unbelievably good deal by today’s standards. But it only took about a year for the first price increase to arrive, bumping it up to $39.99 per month in 2018, and it’s been downhill for our wallets ever since.",

These bulletins detail the vulnerabilities that have been fixed in that month’s security release, with issues ranging from low to critical in severity. Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process. These changes aim to help device manufacturers (OEMs) address high-risk issues more quickly and better protect users from active exploitation. Here’s what’s changing.",

Installing the August Google Play system update appears to fully resolve the glitch. Getting set up with a brand-new phone is one of the great joys of our year, and that’s especially true when we’re working with one of Google’s latest Pixel phones. Right now the Pixel 10 series offers a lot to like, but some owners are running into new-phone compatibility issues — like the one we just looked at with the Pixel 10 and Android Auto , or the problems with Google Home notifications on the Pixel 10 . Another big glitch has been interfering with Pixel 10 phones pairing with Samsung Galaxy Watch models, but we’ve finally got some good news for you there. We first heard about this problem one week ago, with online forums and social media filling up with reports of new Pixel 10 series owners who were struggling to get their Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch 7, and Galaxy Watch Ultra models to connect over Bluetooth. We even experienced this headache first-hand, trying and failing to pair a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with one of our Pixel 10 Pro XL handsets.",

Unlike most prepaid brands, Gigs-powered services can openly advertise that they run on AT&amp;T’s network. Carriers are increasingly making it easier for independent companies to launch their own wireless brands. Last year, T-Mobile unveiled “ Your Name, Our Wireless ,” a program where virtually any business can set up its own carrier, with T-Mobile doing most of the heavy lifting. Now AT&amp;T is taking a similar step, though with a few twists. Instead of running everything directly, AT&amp;T is working with Gigs, a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE) that provides the back-end tools needed for others to create and manage prepaid services on AT&amp;T’s network.

Xiaomi has experimented with lens modules that attach to your phone , realme has experimented with attaching a camera lens to the phone sensor , and vivo went mainstream with the X200 Ultra’s external lens . Now, one more Android OEM wants to supercharge its flagships’ camera capabilities, and it’s teaming up with Hasselblad for it.

Last month, Google began testing a simpler Material You-based interface for Android Auto , featuring background colors that match your phone’s wallpaper. With this change, the background behind the media player for apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music was adapted to match the dominant colors of the wallpapers, upsetting users due to its bland appearance .

Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",

    "body": "TL;DR Last month, some new Pixel 10 series owners reported issues when trying to connect their phones to Android Auto. Google quickly confirmed the problem, and this week reports that a fix is available to those running Android Auto 15. Despite that news, quite a few Pixel 10 owners share that their problems with Android Auto have yet to resolve. If you haven’t given it a shot yet, you really owe it to yourself to discover what Android Auto can do to transform your driving experience. But for as much as we love the platform and all the great apps available for use in our cars, it’s no secret that Auto has a regrettable reputation for being a wee bit temperamental, occasionally malfunctioning in unexpected ways. We’re seeing that right now with reports of music skipping , and a couple weeks back we also heard how new Pixel 10 owners were running into problems with screen freeze-ups. It’s taken a little while, but we finally have some news to share on that latter front. Following up in one of the initial threads reporting the bug in Google’s Android Auto support community , a Google Community Specialist shares word of the progress that’s been made:",

The bug may be linked to a recent update to Google Maps and Waze. Users are switching to Bluetooth streaming to fix the problem. Although Android Auto is great, it isn’t without its faults. Getting the smart driving companion to work consistently can sometimes be an effort in futility. For example, users recently discovered an issue where Pixel 10 devices would cause Android Auto to freeze . Thankfully, Google has now implemented a fix with the most recent update. However, there’s a new annoying problem on the horizon that’s affecting audio playback. Multiple reports are coming in from Reddit about a bug that’s causing music to stutter and skip when connected to Android Auto wirelessly. The issue looks to be happening regardless of the user’s phone brand. It appears the problem may be connected to Google Maps and Waze.",

The teardown reveals just how easy it would be to repair the flagship phone. Google made the battery and display especially easy to remove. As other brands continue to make their smartphones increasingly difficult to repair, it appears Google has gone the opposite direction with the Pixel 10 . The Pixel 10 Pro XL has now been fully disassembled in a new teardown video. This video reveals that Google had repairability in mind when designing the flagship phone. YouTuber JerryRigEverything is back at it again with another teardown, this time for the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Before the teardown even begins, JRE points out that Google released a 234-page repair manual for the device for free. Google also has a 239-page manual for the Pixel 10 Pro and a 228-page manual for the base model.",

When buying a charger, make sure that the device you want to power it with is capable of meeting its listed needs. Google requires 35W of input to use the Pixelsnap Charger at full 25W output. Charging phones is finally exciting again! Well, maybe “exciting” is overselling it — and not so much “again,” we guess — but charging is absolutely having a moment. With magnetic Qi2 support on the Pixel 10 series, and fast 25W wireless charging on the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Android users are getting in on that MagSafe fun and having a blast doing it. While new Pixel 10 owners have no shortage of options to turn to for their charging accessories, the allure of Google’s own Pixelsnap devices is easy to understand. Unfortunately, some users appear to be buying Pixelsnap Chargers without checking the power requirements first, and are understandably having a pretty frustrating time as a result.",

And we’re not talking performance, either, like how high you can get those benchmark figures, but electrical power: how much charge your phone holds, and how quick and easy it is to get it recharged. Phones like the Pixel 10 series have us all talking about wireless Qi2 25W support , and the rise of super-thin models like Apple’s new iPhone Air are forcing us to ask what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to accept. Today we’re looking at the power situation for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 series, and it might not be great news for all those phones. Samsung’s admittedly doing a lot of things right when it comes to batteries, and we continue to see Galaxy phones outdo the competition in terms of their ability to endure extended charging cycles .

Sure, I’d be fairly weirded out if someone took my pulse in my earlobe, but earbuds with built-in sensors sound futuristic, and frankly, convenient. Unfortunately, they’re not about to dethrone your smartwatch for dedicated workout tracking. On paper, it seems like an easy win: music in your ears, heart rate data in your fitness app. In practice, ear-based tracking is notoriously fickle. A little sweat, a loose fit, or the simple act of dropping into downward dog can turn your readings into gibberish. Relying on an earbud to collect your data is like asking a toddler to take your photo; you’ll get something, but it will probably be blurry, crooked, or missing half your head.
