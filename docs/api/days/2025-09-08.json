    "body": "In a recent interview with IGN , Keanu Reeves offered a spark of hope that he may return as foul-mouthed rockerboy Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2, the currently in preproduction follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077. This is far from a confirmation, though, and the original game's many ending permutations complicate the character's potential return. Asked if he'd be willing to reprise the character in Cyberpunk 2⁠—formerly codenamed Project Orion⁠—Reeves said: \"Absolutely, I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again.\" And that's it, that's all he said on the matter. But it's more than we had previously, and it also raises questions as to how CDPR could continue his story. A very remote possibility is reflecting Cyberpunk 2077 choices through Witcher or Mass Effect-style save importing, but that doesn't feel like a good fit. 2077 was a very personal, self-contained story, one where putting in that effort doesn't particularly feel worth it. That's also before you consider that we likely won't even see Cyberpunk 2 before 2030⁠—10 years after Cyberpunk 2077's release⁠—and that it'd be a pretty crazy ask to cut Keanu Reeves a check for content not all players will see. More likely would be an app…",

Carlos Acutis died in 2006 at 15 years of age from leukaemia, but dedicated his short life to spreading awareness of the Catholic faith and helping the poor. Acutis was canonised in an ancient ritual led by Pope Leo, who himself has a good shout to be the first gaming Pope . The teenager's path to sainthood has been remarkably short: the campaign to have him canonised began six years after his death in 2012; he was decreed \"Venerable\" in 2018, \"Blessed\" in 2020, and now the Pope has formally declared Acutis a saint in St Peter's Square in Vatican City. Born in London, Acutis was still a baby when his Italian parents returned home, and he would spend the rest of his life in Milan. Acutis' family recalls him enjoying videogames including, of course, Halo, as well as the likes of Mario and Pokémon. He got a PlayStation when he was eight but, as a true servant of the Lord, restricted himself to one hour of play a day. It should also be said that Acutis was clearly a remarkable child.

If you're looking for inspiration for your next build, or you're new to the hobby, you can check out our picks below. You can easily make changes to these too, and in some cases, we hope you do. We're building and testing every PC we highlight, and if we run into any issues, we'll explain them here. We're back with another build. This time, a compact white gaming PC, powered by AMD's top gaming CPU, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D , and a Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti Eagle OC Ice SFF . I've tried to gain a few style points with the Cooler Master Hyper 612 Apex and Cooler Master Sickleflow Edge 360 fans—three fans combined into a single unit. That's more of a time-saver than you'd think and makes for fewer cables. All of which has been stuffed inside a surprising affordable chassis: Thermaltake's S100 Tempered Glass Snow Edition. This budget case looks better than it should, considering its price tag, and altogether brings this white PC build together nicely.

Rather than going straight to the right, wall-jump up and head into the room marked on the map above.

That's because of the ever-present spectre of AI hanging over our gaming hardware hopes and dreams. After all, AI hardware is where Nvidia makes the vast majority of its money these days, and given the recent loosening of chip export restrictions, I'd say it's a safer bet that most of this memory is destined for China-friendly RTX Pro 6000 variants and the like.

That is very important to us when we design and come up with these new ferocious beings that you will encounter in the next update.\" So it sounds like we'll be stuck scouring each video ahead of the update for clues if we want to get any sort of idea of what terrors we're inevitably going to face. Though it's not all secret. Semiwork has confirmed that there will be a mix of new monsters coming which follow the same l…",

Whether you're looking at a GPU powerhouse like Nvidia or SSD champions like Micron, everyone is looking to get a piece of the AI pie. One of the latest to the game is Acer, which recently showed off its new mini AI machine at a recent launch event in Germany. Notably though, like other machines we've seen of this ilk, the announcement is all specs and no price or availability. CTEE.com spotted this mini AI workstation from Acer during the company's presentation last week. Dubbed the Acer Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation, the mini machines sports a Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip and is aimed at both smaller institutions and individuals looking to tackle AI workloads. Acer's own listing of the Veriton GN100 details the specs further. Apparently they've packed 128 GB of unified memory, as well as up to 4 TB of NVMe M.2 SSD storage into this box that looks about twice the of Mac Mini. Acer boasts that the configuration adds up to deliver up to 1 petaflop of powerful AI compute performance. This is on par with Nvidia's own mini AI PC powerhouse, the DGX Spark. We know a few things about DGX Spar…",

It requires lithography machines to print and scale these silicon thinking machines. High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet , or High NA EUV, lithography tools are among some of the newest and most cutting-edge methods of making chips. These have been recently applied to the industry by big players like Intel in the hopes of stepping ahead of the game, but they might have been beaten to the punch when it comes to commercial application of these machines. A High NA EUV lithography system has just been set up for mass production by SK hynix in its M16 fab based in Icheon, South Korea. SK hynix is a company known for making storage and memory chips. Its using a TWINSCAN EXE:5200B lithography system, as opposed to the 5000 that Intel setup last year, in an effort to produce what will likely be some of the most powerful DRAM ever made. This new system boasts the ability to print transistors 1.7 times smaller than previous High NA EUV machines. It also delivers 2.9 times the existing transistor densities, providing what SK hynix says is a 40% improvement in the NA …",

Shiny Shoe shared with PC Gamer exclusively four of the cards appearing in the update, and provided commentary on each of them.

While other Razer headsets have had refreshes it’s been a while since we’ve seen anything from the Kitty line since the V2 pro, and ear obsessed gamers have had to make do with the V2 specs for a few years. The new Kraken Kitty V3 s come in two options, the Pro and X variants. The pro is the beefier, and pricier option coming in at $180 USD or $330 AUD where as the X is the cheaper lightweight option and will set you back $60 USD or $110 AUD.

It's kind of weird that the two most desired PC games of the moment are such basket cases, right? They boast pre-release anti-hype cycles to give the long Silksong silence a run for its money, yet we apparently can't get enough of them. Let's start with Deadlock: Given the fact that it's an honest-to-god new Valve game, it's shocking it hasn't just clinched number one by default.

    "body": "As with all big releases, Silksong's launch was the starting gun for two gaming races: Modding and speedrunning. The latter is still in a discovery phase before recordkeeping begins on Speedrun.com on October 1, but the Silksong Nexus already has mods up the wazoo⁠—mostly to make the challenging metroidvania a little bit easier. The number two slot on the Nexus top 30 feels like an old friend: Always Have Compass Effect by Synthlight. Silksong, like the first Hollow Knight, requires you to give up space among your buildcrafting \"tools\"—the equivalent of charms from the first game⁠—to have an icon showing your place on the map screen. You effectively have to make yourself weaker to receive that comforting navigation aid. Synthlight's mod just gives you the effect for free, and the author has a similar project for the magnet tool that makes picking up currency easier. Both projects require the BepInEx Unity plugin to function. I tend to be an obnoxious, curmudgeonly purist when it comes to stuff like this: I like friction in games, even when it's a little wonky or annoying. It's just so much more memorable than a game that goes down too smooth. I also appreciate the commitment of a …",

Cut That Wire fits right into the booming \"friend slop\" genre alongside REPO, Peak, Content Warning, and the like⁠—creative, but relatively low-intensity and progression-averse games that can be an excuse to just hang out with your friends. Players are either \"victims\" or the imposter, all trapped in a room together and strapped to ticking time bombs. One victim is the engineer, who is able to see a single safe wire on each bomb. Naturally, you don't know who's who. So, that \"engineer\" could actually be the imposter trying to get you to cut the wrong wire. Spotting the imposter and correctly defusing each player's bomb involves playing mini games, where you have to either outsmart your friends or bluff your way to victory.

These are the premises of the company who build audiograph players: the rudimentary recording devices which capture the voices spoken into them, and offer scratchy, echoey playback via punchcards. All over the city, audiographs hold the private thoughts of lords and admirals, the final words of gangsters and royal caretakers. The inner life that elevates NPCs to characters who haunt their levels long after they're ragdolled. The name above the door of that business? AudioLog. It's only fitting, since the inventor of the audiolog was a writer on both Dishonored and its 2016 sequel. During the development of System Shock, Austin Grossman had helped figure out the fundamentals of the genre we now call the immersive sim. As a writer on Deus Ex, he'd contributed to its indelible influence as a smart, funny, and above all malleable story game.

This was extremely rare in PC gaming in general at the tail end of the nineties, and it makes System Shock 2 unique among the classic immersive sims. With its 25 th anniversary remaster, Nightdive Studios wanted to ensure this co-op functionality was brought up to date with the rest of System Shock 2. Yet according to producer Daniel Grayshon, getting it to work was a nightmare worthy of SHODAN herself. Speaking on the Nightdive Studios Deep Dive podcast, Grayshon explains the sticking point was how System Shock 2 uses an old-fashioned direct IP connection based on DirectPlay. \"[This] was a very old Windows built-in functionality to do some redirecting somewhere and ultimately try to end up at the destination,\" he says. Aside from DirectPlay being insecure by modern standards, Nightdive also wanted the remaster to support crossplay between PS5, Xbox, Switch and so forth. \"We need to strip this out, completely strip this out. We can't have direct connections anymore because the consoles will not allow that at all,\" Grayshon explains. \"We need to construct some kind of lobby system, and we need to tap…",

Now, though, Saber has released an update to RoadCraft that folds some of that driving complexity back in. Or at least, it gives players the option to reinstate it themselves if they so choose. The update adds a \"hard mode\" to RoadCraft in the form of several difficulty modifiers, each of which can be toggled on or off depending on how granular you want the experience to be. For driving fans, the key additions are limited fuel and \"realistic\" gearboxes—the latter of which basically means that RoadCraft now supports manual gear-shifting. Frankly, it's wild that RoadCraft launched without this functionality. Fuel management and manual driving are standard features in most dedicated driving sims, let alone a game born from the legacy of SnowRunner…",

July brought an improved mission system and more realistic erosion, while August saw the return of hardcore mode in tougher, meaner form. September's update is by far the smallest for a while. But there is one adjustment that has potentially game-altering ramifications, and it all has to do with the noise that guns make. Basically, Facepunch has altered how sound propagation for firearms works, so gunshots can be heard at significantly longer distances than before. Implementing this was more complicated than you might expect, as Facepunch explains in a Steam post : \"Networking range in Rust is made up of grids,\" the developer explains. \"These grids are a fixed size and can be adjusted by server owners, they are sometimes reduced on high-populated community servers to lower network overhead. When these grids are reduced, it also reduces things like: gun audio. This makes the world feel incredibly small and closed off.\" But Facepunch now says Rust can \"run gunshots at different distances to the network range\" though…",

It's not likely we'll ever see a PC port of The Two Towers, but fortunately its creator, Stormfront Studios, made a similar hack-and-slash shortly after and that is on PC, with a rerelease by SNEG showing up on Steam . It's Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone, which may lack the cool moments where movie Viggo Mortensen transforms into polygon Viggo Mortensen and then you get to slice up some ringwraiths, but is otherwise very much in the same mold.

How many Dragon Age games would you say there are? Only four, right? Origins, its sequel, Inquisition and last year's Veilguard. Not many, for a beloved franchise spanning a decade and a half at a major publisher. But then the BioWare team behind the series was often characterised as a pirate ship by colleagues: sailing haphazardly between projects and often drifting off course as it found its way to its next hit. Certainly, there was never a straightforward follow-up that built directly on the success of Origins. BioWare's pirates were routinely tossed about on the rough seas of EA's whims, following mandates for tight budgets or new engines or live service features.
