A handful of Pixel owners claim that the December Pixel update may have inadvertently broken one of the commonly used gestures. Several online reports claim that the notification shade can no longer be pulled down once One-Handed Mode is active, a feature that was working normally before the latest update. The first report appeared on Google’s Pixel Support page , where a Pixel 9 Pro owner said they were suddenly unable to open the notification panel after triggering One-Handed Mode. Similar complaints then surfaced on Reddit here and here , with users on devices ranging from the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 10 Pro XL reporting that the same gesture no longer works after the update.",

With the first quarterly release of Android 16 , Google completely revamped the operating system’s UI to introduce its new Material 3 Expressive design language. From the notification panel to the Settings app to the lock screen and beyond, Google redesigned nearly every system interface visible to the user. However, Android is a huge OS, so Google missed a few parts during the initial overhaul, such as the Package Installer that handles sideloading apps. With Android’s latest update, the Package Installer has finally received its Material 3 Expressive redesign, too. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Researchers have identified a new banking malware that replaces your actual banking app with a malicious one. It primarily spreads through APKs distributed via unmoderated channels such as messaging platforms. Once installed, the malware enables hackers to remotely control your device and hide their activities behind fake blank or update screens. Just last week, we learned about a banking malware that exploits accessibility settings on Android to steal your bank credentials in the background. Now, we’re looking at another malware that not only enables remote attacks on Android devices but is distributed freely among hackers as part of a subscription service. Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps. One of the ways that hackers use to achieve that is by creating fake replicas of Google Play Store listings, making users believe they are downloading apps from secure sources when they are actually not. …",

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR Steam’s maker, Valve, has been playing a huge role in Windows emulation on Android. Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.

Pixel Watch users have been asking for better gesture controls for years, and it looks like Google is finally answering their call. Ever since the Pixel Watch 4 introduced Raise to Talk for summoning Gemini , users, including yours truly, have hoped Google would expand its capabilities into more intuitive wrist and finger-based controls. After all, wrist gestures were a thing in the early Android Wear era before being quietly dropped them during the transition to Wear OS. Meanwhile, rivals like Samsung and Apple have offered gestures such as double-tap/double-pinch, fist tap, and more for years now. Well, it looks like the Pixel Watch will finally catch up to its competition real soon.",

Many users were already disgruntled with the Connect Plus subscription after spending big money on a Garmin device. ‘Tis the season when every platform rolls out a Wrapped-style recap of the year, and Garmin has joined the crowd with its new Connect Rundown. Before you rush to review your metrics, you should know that you won’t see it unless you’re paying for Connect Plus. TechRadar reported on the feature’s release, with the Rundown bundling your yearly stats, such as steps, sleep scores, workout totals, Fitness Age, and more, into a shareable summary. Other services, like YouTube and Spotify, offer that kind of recap for free, and Duolingo even incentivizes you to share it . Garmin has opted to make it a premium perk.",

    "body": "TL;DR When Nuki launched its Smart Lock in the US, it introduced a $5.90/month Nuki Premium subscription. Some critical connectivity features like Wi-Fi support and notifications were paywalled behind Premium. Nuki has now decided to do away with Premium subscriptions, instead selling the Smart Lock for a slightly higher upfront cost. Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference. And today we’ve got a critical update on that. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The other alternative is to call other users over Meet, but it requires their accounts to be added to the display as well. In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language.

This marks a return to form for Google after the company surprisingly withheld the source code for Android 16 QPR1 for two months. Developers can now access the new code on the AOSP Git repositories under the “android-16.0.0_r4” tag to begin building custom ROMs. Earlier today, Google rolled out the big Android 16 QPR2 update for all Tensor-powered Pixel devices. While technically classified as a minor update, it’s anything but; it brings a wealth of new customization options, productivity features, security improvements, and developer APIs. Following the release, we wondered when Google would share the source code. We didn’t have to wait long: Google has already begun uploading Android 16 QPR2’s source code to the Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ), giving independent developers the opportunity to build their own operating systems based on the latest release.

    "summary": "The leaked render reveals a textured back, sleek colors, and a new side button.",
    "body": "Credit: Evan Blass TL;DR A new leaked render provides our first look at the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra, showcasing two textured finishes and a refreshed rear design. The image from Android Headlines reveals a triple-camera setup, an extra side button, and a grippy-looking back, but no view of the front display. Other recent leaks suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1.5K OLED screen. Motorola just rolled out the Edge 70 in global markets, but the company clearly isn’t slowing down. A new render shows what’s purported to be the first official image of the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra, hinting at where the next flagship is headed. The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70. The Motorola logo sits in the middle and seems to blend with each color, and the back texture looks more like something meant to add grip than decoration.",
