Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Away From Home on Steam Away From Home is an RPG in which you enter a strange dreamland whenever you sleep. Playing as Abby, you'll walk through a charming overworld with her brother Michael and then enter a rhythm game mode when you need to battle with the denizens of this mysterious new world. During one of the fights—set in a boxing ring, because why not?—Abby transforms into a muscle-clad giant. It's very Love Lies Bleeding. During another battle, we see that just her left arm has been buffed up, and she uses it to deliver a devastating punch. Other fights take place on what appear to be show stages, with one contender looking suspiciously like Johnny Bravo. And one has fried eggs flying past in the background. It's a wild ride, the perfect encapsulation of all the weird and random locales and personalities you meet when you're asleep. What's the same across all fights is th…",

The company split up while working on Open Roads, and Gaynor's management was a central cause : He admitted that his strengths \"do not lie with attempting to manage a large project or direct the work of others.\" \"I hope that along with continuing the self-reflective work of the last couple years and moving forward with a sense of humility, that by taking Fullbright down this new path I'm able to make my next steps positive, productive ones,\" Gaynor wrote in 2023 when he announced that he'd started work on a new game on his own.

This first-person action RPG is a dark fantasy adventure that wears its familiar retro aesthetic proudly in an age of hyperreal graphics and ray-traced lighting. Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Queen’s Domain now on Steam This is an experience that pays close homage to games like King's Field, an RPG series made by FromSoftware that was initially released on the PS1. It's so loyal to its inspiration that the Queen’s Domain devs at Freshly Baked Games even mimicked the King's Field logo typeface to draw in fervent fans of the genre. The reveal trailer is made entirely of in-game capture to sink our teeth into. It begins with an atmospheric panning shot of a multi-level ruin, pyramidal structures looming ominously against an ocean backdrop, and darkened by moody, greenish-white cloud cover. It cuts abruptly to an animated shot of some guards camped on hard paving, banners waving gently in the dark. Queen’s Domain wants you to feel uneasy.
