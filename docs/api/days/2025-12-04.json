    "body": "Splatterhouse was a sidescrolling beat 'em up series that first appeared in Japanese arcades in 1988. It and subsequent Splatterhouse games were novel for their gory horror approach to a genre we more readily associate with street fighting or Ninja Turtles . The series is mostly forgotten to all except a small diehard community, but it turns out Namco had bigger and more ambitious plans for it that never officially materialised. Namco did release one Splatterhouse spin-off in the form of 1989's platformer Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti, a watered down and \"cutesy\" take on the more mature (but still quite tongue-in-cheek) beat 'em up outings. It can nowadays be played via the Namco Museum Archives . But there was another unreleased Famicom Splatterhouse game. That was proven in October when a fully playable ROM of something called Splatterhouse: World was dumped on 4chan. Taking the form of a ye olde 8-bit JRPG, it's a truly fascinating artefact, not least because there are very few horror-themed JRPGs from that era: Capcom's Sweet Home is the only other one that comes to mind. While the October dump was a huge moment, seemingly undeniable proof of Splatterhouse: World's existence…",

And yes, occasionally, as Booker DeWitt, I would eat an entire birthday cake out of a garbage can. So what? A man's gotta heal, and sometimes a man's only option is a trash can behind a desk in a police station where someone, for some reason, threw away an entire birthday cake. Speaking of cakes: that's what our quiz today is all about! I'll show you 10 cakes, and all you've gotta do is type in the name of the game each cake is from. Should be a piece of cake, right? I'm sure you've got what it cakes to come out on top. OK, enough cake puns: be sure to let us know how you did in the comments!",

This nun is set to be one of the most powerful characters in the game alongside Wylder, entering a state where she can surge-sprint without consuming stamina as well as get an enhanced dodge. She can also use her art whenever another character uses theirs, which is pretty cracked if I'm frank. You'll need to unlock both Undertaker and Scholar, as well as defeat two Nightlords (including Gladius), if you want to access the new Balancers boss and The Great Hollows Shifting Earth event, so you'll need to do this first before you can start Forsaken Hollows properly.

Sure, melee characters, like Wylder and Raider, are getting big buffs to related passive effects, but I personally have received a huge buff because you can now rename your relic presets. Nightreign has given players the ability to save a relic setup for a while now, and it's incredibly useful to tailor them for different bosses. I have Ironeye set up with a relic that gives his bow poison damage for the bosses weak to that specific element, for instance. Not every boss is weak to poison, however, so it's a good idea to have a few different presets ready. There was one problem though: You had no way of sorting your presets by anything other than the date you saved them, for some reason. The new patch fixes this problem and lets you just name them whatever you want. No longer will I have to frantically skim through each preset to figure out which one is for fire damage and which one is for frost. I can just name them \"fire\" and \"frost\". Nightreign is finally playable. The relic system has been divisive from the st…",

Steam was the first major storefront to refuse to carry Horses , a first-person psychological horror adventure about \"the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility\" set on a ranch where nude human beings in horse masks are treated as livestock. Publisher Santa Ragione said in November that Valve declined to carry Horses because it contained \"content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor.\" Santa Ragione disputed that characterization, but an appeal was rejected and the ban stands. The Epic Games Store followed with its own ban on December 1, one day before Horses was set to launch. Which brings us, indirectly, to the Humble Store: In an email sent to PC Gamer following the Epic ban, Santa Ragione said the Humble Store had confirmed that it would continue to carry the game.

But Katie, I hear you say, if a normal keyboard has all the keys you could ever want, what's the point getting rid of them in favour of a TKL board? Well, friend, it's all about real estate and maneuverability. And cash, of course. But isn't everything? Say you've spent all your cash on the best gaming PC and you're now stuck with a teeny tiny desk. A TKL board nets you more desk space so you can stack plates and coffee cups beside it to your heart's content, or whatever else you're draping over your battlestation. With the MSI Forge GK600, you're killing two birds with one stone: saving space on your desk while also protecting your dragon's hoard of gold. Let's get into what makes the Forge GK600 special and, of course, what doesn't. Sitting somewhere in the region of a 75-80% layout, the Forge GK600 takes up less space without sacrificing as much productivity as the super compact layout of something like the 60% NuPhy Air60 HE . Its dedicated navigation and direction keys aren't being swallowed up by the mass of other keys, so you don't need to fumble around for them, while the two-col…",

Not too long ago, Logitech revised its longstanding low-profile keyboard lineup with a new G915 X Lightspeed model and the cheaper G515 Lightspeed TKL option, both of which I've looked at in the past. Both of those keyboards were in the Swiss brand's more traditional wheelhouse, opting for a conventional low-profile switch, plus creature comforts such as solid build quality and fast wireless connectivity. The all-new G515 Rapid TKL isn't in that wheelhouse, though. Its switches are no longer standard low-profile mechanical ones, and instead are low-profile magnetic analogue ones. That means all the fun of rapid trigger and its clever software trickery into an already short and snappy travel. I'll get to those switches in a minute. As I mentioned a minute ago, this keyboard is an example of the Logitech-flavoured cake being given to you but not consumed, in that it sacrifices any form of wireless connectivity. Say goodbye to Lightspeed, chaps, as it isn't here, which is a real shame. At least it works plug-and-play, I suppose. Log…",

There's been the update that overhauled fighters and rangers , the one that gave you six more talent points , and that one that let you turn its spiders into orbs . But more is yet to come. And it was set to come, originally, this autumn, as part of the game's fall 2025 pitstop on its roadmap. \"If you’ve checked out a calendar you may have also noticed that fall is quickly running out,\" Obsidian wrote in an update for fans on its Discord. You can probably guess what that means: \"Avowed will not be receiving a fall update.\" There is an upside, though. To compensate for its tardiness, Obsidian is replacing the fall update with a one-year anniversary update, due this February, which will include all the stuff originally slated for autumn and some extra gubbins, too, making it \"the biggest update for the game yet.\" And if you think Obsidian deigned to detail just what those bonus features will contain, well, you might not …",

Reportedly, the OpenAI chief has called for staff to be pulled from other projects, including advertising, AI agents, and its forthcoming personal assistant, Pulse, in order to spruce up ChatGPT. The team behind the inordinately popular chatbot will also have to attend a daily meeting to report on their progress, which I can only imagine takes place in a ready room not far from the bridge. Futuristic red and gold uniforms, optional. The recent release of Google's Gemini 3 has been very well-received , and monthly active Gemini users are already reported to have grown from 450 million in July to 650 million this autumn. The new iteration of Gemini looks to best ChatGPT in several key areas, including critical analysis, strategic reasoning, and overall performance.

This ain't no teeny tiny slider patty but a full quarter pounder.

However, it's not just the chip that's greedy; the Ayeneo Next II's TDP is 85 W in order to feed an impressive list of tech specs. To begin with, there's the 9.06-inch OLED panel that features 2400 × 1504 resolution and enjoys up to 1100 nits of brightness.

That thing has been taking an absolute beating over the last year. We've seen very visible effects of this with various memorable outages, but now we've also got some numbers to put to it, in the form of \"hyper-volumetric\" DDoS attacks. Giant content delivery network (CDN) Cloudflare has released some somewhat troubling stats and info regarding the past year of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These are essentially attacks that attempt to flood a target service with packets of data to overload and overwhelm it and prevent it from doing the work it's actually meant to be doing, such as providing an internet connection to customers or displaying webpages. According to Cloudflare, DDoS attacks are up 170% to 36.2 million in 2025 compared to 2024. To zoom in a little, the company says that in the third quarter of 2025, it \"mitigated an average of 3,780 DDoS attacks every hour.\" That's 63 DDoS attacks each minute, or about one every second. Not every DDoS attack is a noteworthy one, of course, but ther…",

And while gaming mouse docks are often disregarded as a novelty or even a gimmick, it's hard to deny their practicality. I mean, plugging in ? In 2025? Why waste my energy on something so tedious? Thankfully, the MSI Versa Pro Wireless gaming mouse and Mouse Dock Pro are all about the path of least resistance. Since the world is now moving into some strange, AI-fuelled Edo period I'm betting the use of gaming mouse docks will start to see a resurgence, too. Alright, better prep yourself for further laziness productivity rants as we get into why the MSI Versa Pro Wireless and Mouse Dock Pro is quickly becoming my new favorite gaming accessory duo. Aside from the huge, lit-up logo and RGB-studded side panels there's a certain sleek simplicity to the Versa Pro and Mouse Dock Pro. Granted they sit closer to that modern gamery aesthetic than the distinguished retro vibe of the 8BitDo Retro R8 , for example, and only coming i…",

Its system requirements are so detailed that you'll probably be able to figure out the exact setting you'll be using the game, long before you get a chance to install it. You can check them out for yourself via Hypixel Studio's news post on the matter. Let's start with the good stuff to begin with, just as Hypixel does: listing the expected performance, graphics preset, and screen resolution for the minimum, recommended, and 'streamer' requirements. Specifically, it's 30 fps at 1080p Low for minimum, 60 fps at 1080p High for recommended, and \"stable framerate with high-quality video capture and streaming at 1440p\".

The hook for Torvalds' appearance on the channel was building his perfect PC. His choices for a DIY PC build are intriguing by any measure, but even more interesting when you dig down into the details, which include an AMD Threadripper CPU with ECC memory support for the ultimate in reliability, but also an Intel Arc GPU. And it's that ECC memory where the whole Windows stability riff comes in. Hold that thought.

By relegating key button presses to the domain of limbs you otherwise aren't using to game… is this what they call 'maximising efficiency'?

These cursed keebs come in three and four key versions, so the world's your oyster—or rather, foot pedal.

Most Wanted is a little bit special, because we ask our council of over 120 journalists, celebrities, content creators, and games industry experts to vote on our 100-game longlist to decide what the 25 Most Wanted games are. This year, longlisted games include huge titles like Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, Resident Evil Requiem, and 007 First Light, among others. Our council is no less impressive, with members such as Tanya Short, Martin Wahlund, Dave Oshry, Terry Crews, Caroline Marchal, and Devora Wilde all casting their opinions. Hosted by regular host and esports legend Frankie Ward, PC Gamer's own Midas, and with the vocal talents of Baldur's Gate 3 and Hades 2's Amelia Tyler, it's promising to be a good show. Trust me, I was there when we filmed it. On a spaceship .

If you need a refresher, here's a rundown of all eight episodes. Episode 1: The End In the year 2077, cowboy actor Cooper Howard performs with his daughter Janey at a birthday party. When Cooper refuses to do a thumbs-up his daughter asks why, and he explains that in the Marines they were taught to measure mushroom clouds with their thumbs—if it was bigger than their thumb it wasn't worth running away. Moments later, while Cooper is inside getting a slice of birthday cake, his daughter holds up her thumb to the smoke on the horizon. 219 years later, Lucy Maclean is convincing the council of Vault 33 to let her be the bride in an upcoming trade with their neighbors Vault 32. At the wedding her father Hank, who is the Overseer and a trade from Vault 31 himself, gives a speech explaining radiation levels on the surface are dropping to the point that Lucy and her new husband Monty's children will be able to recolonize the surface. \"I must admit…",

A breakdown of the ownership between these parties wasn't given at the time, but as it turns out, one is committing significantly more cash than the others. According to the Wall Street Journal , the PIF will own 93.4 percent of EA—a gargantuan amount that renders the other stakeholders insignificant by comparison. Silver Lake and Affinity Partners are set to own 5.5% and 1.1%, both of whom PIF is also a \"significant investor\" in. In other words, if the buyout passes regulatory and shareholder approvals, the PIF will effectively own EA. The report lists some other finer details about the transaction, now public thanks to a filing with Brazil's antitrust regulator. $36.4 billion of the $55 billion cost will be funded in equity, while the remaining $20 billion will debt. Remove an existing $5.2 billion stake PIF already has in EA, and it looks like PIF has, according to WSJ, put up \"about $29 billion\" for EA's buyout. PIF's huge majority may not…",

Sure, you can play the new supportive scholar character or the aggressive nun with the hammer, but there's also new locations coming to the original Limveld map and a new shifting earth event that brings you to what is effectively an entirely separate landmass.

As prolific as Ryu Ga Gotoku is, they're also remarkably consistent: the same bonkers mix of melodrama and absurd humour is threaded through every one of these games, even the ones set in the 17th century. It's a formula that took a while to cotton on outside of Japan: it didn't really land as a big commercial success in the west until 2015's Yakuza 0. And that game landed loudly, despite making no overt compromises for western audiences. But now that western audiences are paying attention, will Ryu Ga Gotoku indulge them more? It seems unlikely, according to a new Automaton interview with three RGG Studio big wigs. Asked whether the studio might abandon its credo of \"making what feels true to RGG Studio\" in the event that their games became huge global concerns, series executive producer Yokoyama Masayoshi was unequivocal. \"No, it won’t,\" he said. \"If we really wanted to make a game for overseas audiences, it would obviously be better to make a foreign protagonist and set the story overseas. But if we did that, it wouldn’t be Like…",

Despite that age, and the fact that it's a singleplayer RPG with no live service grind, its peak concurrent player count today on Steam—and only Steam—was nearly 44,000. That's genuinely astounding, especially when you consider that the game was such a mess at launch that it literally wiped 75% of CD Projekt's valuation off the books. So here we are, five years later, and an awful lot of fans are holding out hope that CD Projekt is cooking up something big for the big birthday. Not just because five years is an obvious benchmark for such things, but because of a December 1 post on X . SECURE COMMS CHANNEL ESTABLISHED.

Santa Ragione filed an appeal, but it was rejected 12 hours later with no further explanation. Epic also indicated the game could be updated to bring it into compliance, but \"the email did not include any information on what would need to be changed,\" Santa Ragione said, and even if it had there'd be no way to make extensive changes one day ahead of release.

But in the 10 years since Shovel Knight first appeared, developer Yacht Club Games has struggled to produce a full-on follow-up hit, and in a new interview with Bloomberg , studio founder Cris Velasco says it will be in serious trouble if its next game isn't a success. That 'next game' would be Mina the Hollower , a sort of gothic Link's Awakening that was revealed to the world in 2022 . \"It’s make-or-break for sure,\" Velasco said. \"If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good.\" Development of Mina the Hollower has been troubled, according to the interview. The game was proposed in 2019 and work began in earnest in early 2020, when Yacht Club split into two teams, one for the full-on Shovel Knight sequel—that 3D project we heard about back in 2020, apparently—and the other to handle Mina the Hollower, which was intended to be a sma…",
