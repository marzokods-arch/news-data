Given the huge success the game has gone on to enjoy, ongoing support seemed inevitable. According to PC Gamer's official data partner, Newzoo , Ball X Pit has accumulated at least 744,000 players (with a majority on Xbox, where the game was available on Game Pass). But even still I'm surprised how much developer Kenny Sun has announced for 2026. Coming soon is not just one update, but three, spread out over the first half of the year. (Image credit: Kenny Sun) We'll be getting the Regal update in January, the Shadow update in April, and the Naturalist update in July—all of them free. What each one will specifically contain is still a mystery, but between them we're promised they'll add new balls, characters, buildings, evolutions, \"and more\". Will all that lure me back? I could definitely see it. For me, the fun of Ball X Pit was in the novelty—steadily unlocking more and more game-breaking features and seeing how far…",

If that doesn't sound revolutionary to you, you must not understand that the true endgame of every MMO is fashion. In all seriousness, it's actually a pretty huge move. Previously, FF14's glamour system, which allows you to layer sets of appearances over your current gear, only permitted you to do so with gear that can be equipped by your current job and level. Starting with Patch 7.4, this will no longer be the case, opening up a whole new world of fashion options. This came as a surprise to players, due to the game director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P)'s past stance on the issue—even in the face of job-agnostic gear that was increasingly allowing players to throw plate armour onto their White Mages. Talking to Famitsu in an interview, Yoshi-P reveals why (note: these quotes have been machine-translated): \"I felt more strongly than anyone else that we had to cherish the Final Fantasy worldview. I felt that the way Final Fantasy ​​should be is for Dragoons to be able to equip their character in that style, and to be able to hold their spear and strik…",

I personally think this mob boss is one of the coolest in the game, part-Deacons of the Deep from Dark Souls 3, part-Cleanrot Knights from Elden Ring. This group of glaive-wielding valkyries can gang up on you if you're not careful. After you defeat them all, they do an Abyss Watchers from Dark Souls 3, creating a super version of themselves with enhanced attacks. All the other Balancers will get back up, too, meaning you have to balance dealing with them and the main aggressive entity. It's a fun yet chaotic fight, so here's what they're weak to, as well as some additional tips to help you beat them if you're struggling.

So if the prices here don't match up when you read this, that's likely why. We recommend using a price checker tool, such as CamelCamelCamel, to see if you're still getting a good deal. I think I've tested every single combination of controller and NAND flash found in all of the top-end PCIe 5.0 SSDs at this point. At least all of them, trying to match or break parity with Sandisk's WD SN8100 , that is, all pinching a little bit of the drive's tech while they do it. Yet this is the first SSD I've found that kind of does manage to do that, yet in a very weird, roundabout way. This latest batch of Kingston Fury Renegade G5 drives, including this particularly boisterous 8 TB unit we have on display here, touts exactly the same NAND flash and controller combo as found in the SN8100. But, of course, all dressed up in a Kingston skirt. And I'll be frank, it works really, really well. Arguably unsurprisingly, given it's the same hardware combo that catapulted the SN8100 into our best SSD list. It's been well documented at this point …",

This time we're opting for scales rather than feathers in the My Pet Dragons mod , which does exactly what it says on the tin—adds dragons to the game. Lots of them, too. While this mod might not be as popular among players, it certainly feels just as exciting. The My Pet Dragons mod adds over 500 variations of the little critters to your game, with some spawning in specific biomes and in the Nether. You'll be able to find everything from Ice and Fire dragons to Demon and Lucky Block species (whatever that means) and tame them before embarking on some pretty intense training. After all, you don't just want a cute pet, you probably want something that can take down at least some of Minecraft's many mobs. Yes, before you ask, you can use the dragons as mounts, too. So, similarly to the owls mod, you'll be able to craft a carriage for your dragons to carry you around on, ridding the need to trek to the End and get yourself an Elytra. Plus, there is just something inherently cool about being carted around by a little dragon. It's not all abou…",

Something that's slightly interesting, or some weird quirk that the manufacturer has tweaked a certain way that's led to some curious performance metric in one manner or another.

One person who isn't quite so pessimistic, though, is the CEO of IBM, Arvind Krishna. Krishna recently spoke with Nilay Patel, EIC of The Verge, on the Decoder podcast and sounded optimistic about the future of AI—which is, to my ears at least, quite refreshing, even if I don't agree on all points. In particular, although he does explicitly say \"no\", we're not in an AI bubble, his explanation, at least on my listening, doesn't seem to completely rule out this possibility; rather, it explains how such things aren't all-or-nothing. I say this is \"refreshing\" just because of how one-dimensional a lot of AI talk can be: either 'AI sucks and the bubble's going to burst' or 'AI is an amazing innovation that will revolutionise everything.' The IBM CEO's perspective, however, injects what I think is a little more nuance and realism into the debate, by reminding us of a very simple fact: in industry, there are often some winners and many…",

With approximately 35% of the DRAM market , SK hynix is second only to Samsung, and over the past 12 months, it's been steadily eating away at its South Korean rival's lead. Neither company, though, are in a position where they can produce enough RAM to satisfy every demand. Put simply, it's all down to the astonishing growth of the AI server market.

It and subsequent Splatterhouse games were novel for their gory horror approach to a genre we more readily associate with street fighting or Ninja Turtles . The series is mostly forgotten to all except a small diehard community, but it turns out Namco had bigger and more ambitious plans for it that never officially materialised. Namco did release one Splatterhouse spin-off in the form of 1989's platformer Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti, a watered down and \"cutesy\" take on the more mature (but still quite tongue-in-cheek) beat 'em up outings. It can nowadays be played via the Namco Museum Archives . But there was another unreleased Famicom Splatterhouse game. That was proven in October when a fully playable ROM of something called Splatterhouse: World was dumped on 4chan. Taking the form of a ye olde 8-bit JRPG, it's a truly fascinating artefact, not least because there are very few horror-themed JRPGs from that era: Capcom's Sweet Home is the only other one that comes to mind. While the October dump was a huge moment, seemingly undeniable proof of Splatterhouse: World's existence…",

And yes, occasionally, as Booker DeWitt, I would eat an entire birthday cake out of a garbage can. So what? A man's gotta heal, and sometimes a man's only option is a trash can behind a desk in a police station where someone, for some reason, threw away an entire birthday cake. Speaking of cakes: that's what our quiz today is all about! I'll show you 10 cakes, and all you've gotta do is type in the name of the game each cake is from. Should be a piece of cake, right? I'm sure you've got what it cakes to come out on top. OK, enough cake puns: be sure to let us know how you did in the comments!",

The server farm next door has way more cash to burn. Just yesterday we were reporting that high memory prices may well continue into 2028 , as Samsung and SK Hynix, who produce roughly 70% of the DRAM currently on the market, are focusing on supplying the enterprise business without dramatically increasing their production capacity. In that same story we reported that Micron, the other big player in memory, is planning to ramp up production that won't be online until late 2028. But now it sounds like those new assembly lines won't be sending any RAM our way even when they're online. You may know the Crucial brand name better than Micron, despite the tech company being established in the United States way back in 1978. Crucial is Micron's consumer-focused brand and has been used on RAM, SSDs, even SD cards for years and ye…",

Sure, melee characters, like Wylder and Raider, are getting big buffs to related passive effects, but I personally have received a huge buff because you can now rename your relic presets. Nightreign has given players the ability to save a relic setup for a while now, and it's incredibly useful to tailor them for different bosses. I have Ironeye set up with a relic that gives his bow poison damage for the bosses weak to that specific element, for instance. Not every boss is weak to poison, however, so it's a good idea to have a few different presets ready. There was one problem though: You had no way of sorting your presets by anything other than the date you saved them, for some reason. The new patch fixes this problem and lets you just name them whatever you want. No longer will I have to frantically skim through each preset to figure out which one is for fire damage and which one is for frost. I can just name them \"fire\" and \"frost\". Nightreign is finally playable. The relic system has been divisive from the st…",

Publisher Santa Ragione said in November that Valve declined to carry Horses because it contained \"content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor.\" Santa Ragione disputed that characterization, but an appeal was rejected and the ban stands. The Epic Games Store followed with its own ban on December 1, one day before Horses was set to launch.

    "body": "As the old saying goes, you can't have your cake and eat it, too. And that's a shame, because I was quite looking forward to this Logitech-flavoured one. Not too long ago, Logitech revised its longstanding low-profile keyboard lineup with a new G915 X Lightspeed model and the cheaper G515 Lightspeed TKL option, both of which I've looked at in the past. Both of those keyboards were in the Swiss brand's more traditional wheelhouse, opting for a conventional low-profile switch, plus creature comforts such as solid build quality and fast wireless connectivity. The all-new G515 Rapid TKL isn't in that wheelhouse, though. Its switches are no longer standard low-profile mechanical ones, and instead are low-profile magnetic analogue ones. That means all the fun of rapid trigger and its clever software trickery into an already short and snappy travel. I'll get to those switches in a minute. As I mentioned a minute ago, this keyboard is an example of the Logitech-flavoured cake being given to you but not consumed, in that it sacrifices any form of wireless connectivity. Say goodbye to Lightspeed, chaps, as it isn't here, which is a real shame. At least it works plug-and-play, I suppose. Log…",

But what's really amazing is every single one of them feels completely distinct, fun to play, and truly super . I just wish Marvel Cosmic Invasion offered more for them all to do. In the vein of developer Tribute Games' last game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, this is an unabashedly old school side-scroller. Bad guys appear, you punch them until they're all gone, then you move a bit further right and more bad guys appear. Repeat until you reach a boss fight. Simple, nostalgic, satisfying. (Image credit: Tribute Games Inc) But as in Shredder's Revenge, more modern ideas enhance the action. Blocks, parries, and dodges make it easier to stay on your feet than in the old classics, for example, and generous launchers and timing window…",

There's been the update that overhauled fighters and rangers , the one that gave you six more talent points , and that one that let you turn its spiders into orbs . But more is yet to come. And it was set to come, originally, this autumn, as part of the game's fall 2025 pitstop on its roadmap. \"If you’ve checked out a calendar you may have also noticed that fall is quickly running out,\" Obsidian wrote in an update for fans on its Discord. You can probably guess what that means: \"Avowed will not be receiving a fall update.\" There is an upside, though. To compensate for its tardiness, Obsidian is replacing the fall update with a one-year anniversary update, due this February, which will include all the stuff originally slated for autumn and some extra gubbins, too, making it \"the biggest update for the game yet.\" And if you think Obsidian deigned to detail just what those bonus features will contain, well, you might not …",

Google's competing Gemini AI has made progress in great leaps and bounds since the summer—and Altman looks to have called for an all hands to the pumps initiative as a result. Reportedly, the OpenAI chief has called for staff to be pulled from other projects, including advertising, AI agents, and its forthcoming personal assistant, Pulse, in order to spruce up ChatGPT. The team behind the inordinately popular chatbot will also have to attend a daily meeting to report on their progress, which I can only imagine takes place in a ready room not far from the bridge. Futuristic red and gold uniforms, optional. The recent release of Google's Gemini 3 has been very well-received , and monthly active Gemini users are already reported to have grown from 450 million in July to 650 million this autumn. The new iteration of Gemini looks to best ChatGPT in several key areas, including critical analysis, strategic reasoning, and overall performance.

This is notable because Raspberry Pi SBCs (single-board computers) are normally very consistent in pricing. As the company points out, \"at $35, a 1GB Raspberry Pi 4 costs the same as a 256MB Raspberry Pi 1 from 2012.\" But now prices are being raised. Here are the exact increases as Raspberry lays it out: Product Memory Old price New price Increase Raspberry Pi 4 4 GB $55 $60 9% Raspberry Pi 4 8 GB $75 $85 13% Raspberry Pi 5 1 GB – $45 – Raspberry Pi 5 2 GB $50 $55 10% Raspberry Pi 5 4 GB $60 $70 17% Raspberry Pi 5 8 GB $80 $95 19% Raspberry Pi 5 16 GB $120 $145 21% The biggest increases, proportionally, are hitting the 4 GB and 8 GB configurations of the Raspberry Pi 5.

This ain't no teeny tiny slider patty but a full quarter pounder. There's no details on pricing or a release date yet but what I can tell you now is that, yes, in theory you could still take this chunky gaming handheld on a plane (though, you would need to check ahead of time what restrictions on 100+ Wh batteries may be in place for your specific airline). However, it's not just the chip that's greedy; the Ayeneo Next II's TDP is 85 W in order to feed an impressive list of tech specs. To begin with, there's the 9.06-inch OLED panel that features 2400 × 1504 resolution and enjoys up to 1100 nits of brightness. This screen also offers variable refresh rates, including options for 60 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz, 144 Hz, and 165 Hz. But even such a luscious screen is still just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg.

In an analyst note this week, Moorhead first said he was \"bullish\" about Intel's new 18A node, which is in production now and will first be seen in January underpinning Intel's next-gen Panther Lake CPUs . He then explained why things are also looking up for 14A. \"From everything I’ve seen—and all the Intel customers I’ve talked to—I’m very confident that Intel will use 18A to successfully produce tens of millions of leading-edge chips in the Panther Lake family and beyond in the near term.
