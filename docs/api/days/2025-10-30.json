We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. As gamers, we all get up in the morning, check the latest gaming news, download updates for the games we want to play, then spend five to six hours closely examining the specifications and technical drawings of the latest videogame patents. Amirite? OK, maybe videogame patents aren't at the forefront of our minds, but they do come up as a topic from time to time, especially due to some of the more, ahem, litigious game companies out there. And even when they're not in the news, it can be kind of fun to look through patents for various gaming tech and game systems, especially when it comes to the diagrams included in the patents. In that spirit, I've got a new quiz for you! I'll show you a diagram from a videogame patent, and you do your best to answer a multiple choice question about it. You can hit the Hint button to remove one of the wrong answers if you need a little help. Good luck!",

Earlier this week, DHS posted an image from Microsoft's Halo game series , emblazoned with the words \"Fight the Flood,\" a reference to the ongoing anti-immigration efforts being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) across the US. Dehumanizing people by equating them to a parasitic alien life form is overtly grotesque, yes, but the message also invoked a more mundane question: Did DHS have Microsoft's permission to use the image in its message? (Image credit: Homeland Security (Twitter)) Microsoft—one of the many corporate donors supporting the construction of the ballroom that will replace the now-demolished White House East Wing—refused to comment on the use of one of its most popular games in a dangerously racist message.

While the reception of Battlefield Redsec —a free-to-play battle royale mode with its own map and class abilities—is largely positive, the wider player base isn't as happy with changes made to Battlefield 6 itself. Namely, they're fed up with pop-ads for the new Season 1 battle pass, they're unhappy with the new map Blackwell Fields , and they're miffed that the only way to complete weekly challenges is to play battle royale, a mode that doesn't necessarily appeal to the folks who paid $70 for Battlefield 6 three weeks ago. As expected, folks are taking their frustrations out on Battlefield 6's Steam rating , which has now dropped to an overall \"Mixed\" after an influx of over 5,000 negative reviews since yesterday. The flood of negative ratings pile on to an existing trend dating back over a week, around the time players were reacting to the too-blue \"Wicked Grin\" cosmetic , and when DICE axed XP gains from Portal servers in a bid to eliminate XP farms. \"Before season one it was like the moment when Gandalf showed in Helm's Deep there was hope.

Not quite a decade later, we find ourselves standing amidst the rubble of that once-great ambition, with a single question on our minds: What the hell went wrong? Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright . And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end : Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours ) but active development is over.

We spent the better part of this year lamenting ridiculously high GPU prices , and as soon as said prices finally start dropping , memory and storage prices start climbing. You might have noticed this worrying trend if you've been looking for a RAM upgrade lately. Charts on pcpartpicker.com are telling: since mid-2025, DDR4 and DDR5 consumer memory kit prices have been climbing, with particularly notable spikes since September. That's true all the way from DDR4-3200 kits up to DDR5-6000 ones. To take one concrete example, this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 kit on Amazon , which was stable at $95 or less throughout most of the year, but from mid-August onward started climbing. Now, it's up to $184, which makes for a 94% increase. This, after a good few months of sustained DDR5 price drops through the tail end of 2024 and first half of 2025. DDR4 isn't safe, either, as this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4-3600 kit on Amazon shows. It was stable at about $70 through most of the year, but excluding a brief drop back to down to this original price, from mid-August it shot up to a new price of $161. That's a 115…",

Well, I'd argue it's when you need to strap a bunch of external devices to it in order to get the most out of it, which is exactly what's happened to the Strix Halo-powered OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex . It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

In very simple terms, that means the Vera Rubin superchip sports 60 times the number of transistors of an Nvidia RTX 5090 gaming GPU . And that is a completely bananas comparison. What's more, the Vera Rubin superchip is capable of 100 petaflops of raw compute. And that is exactly 100 times more compute than Nvidia claims for its neat little DGX Spark AI box . Oh, and it packs 88 custom Arm cores suporting 176 software threads for conventional CPU compute, too.

I haven't had as long as I'd like with Embark's new extraction shooter, so this review is indeed in progress, with the final version coming sometime in the future when I've had a chance to properly experience it in all of its intersocial beauty. The premise of Arc Raiders is simple: the world has gone to hell thanks to robots and AI, so now all the humans are holed up in small communities underground, with you and other raiders occasionally popping up to the surface to gather resources to trade, create gear, and upgrade your base. On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff.

This leaves you with three choices: kill De Vries, spare De Vries, or spare De Vries and let her assassinate the representatives. Each option has its own set of consequences, so I've laid them out below, including the path you need to take dialogue-wise to get De Vries to stand down.

Options to purchase the game are gone, the recent reviews are an angry chorus of fans blindsided by Amazon's decision to kill the game, and even the screenshots have vanished. In their place is a single, static image informing onlookers that content updates are done. You can compare the page's glow-down yourself. On the Wayback Machine , a version of the New World Steam page from October 7 features 14 screenshots, three trailers, and 'Mostly Positive' recent reviews, plus options to purchase either the game's standard or deluxe edition. It's now all gone. Which is more than a little odd, since Amazon explicitly said yesterday that the MMO would remain available for purchase \"on all platforms until further notice.\" Canny readers may note that Steam is a platform, and that no notice was given that the game was being removed from it. I've reached out to Amazon to ask about this, and I will update this piece if I hear back. \"New World: Aeternum is no longer releasing conten…",

For those that missed it, the official Nvidia GTC, originally streamed live from Washington, D.C. on October 28, can be viewed here . Though it's sitting pretty at nearly 200,000 views now, that wasn't the case during the stream; while about 20,000 tuned in for the official event as it went live, nearly 100,000 viewers were said to be watching the deepfake feed broadcast (hosted by a channel calling itself Nvidia Live) at the same time (via Tomshardware ). The stream is still up with nearly 100,000 viewers. What is YouTube doing? pic.twitter.com/4uReZrTkFD October 28, 2025 The counterfeit stream has since been removed, but CRN editor Dylan Martin posted to X about the debacle as it happened, observing that at its peak, the official upload had only about a fifth of the viewership of the deepfake feed.

During yesterday's GTC keynote presentation , Huang explained how it was—who'd a thunk it?!—Nvidia GPUs that would unlock the potential of quantum computing. Huang outlined how the individual bits of quantum computing, known as qubits, are inherently unstable, only surviving for a few hundred operations. But \"solving meaningful problems requires trillions of operations,\" Huang said. \"The answer is quantum error correction. Measuring disturbs a qubit which destroys the information inside it. The trick is to add extra qubits—entangled—so that measuring them gives us enough information to calculate where errors occurred without damaging the qubits we care about.\" In this scenario, hundreds of entangled qubits combine to form a single, error-corrected logical qubit inside a QPU or quantum processing unit.

What if I told you there's a way to get around this in the Battlefield 6 battle royale Redsec, if only you show some restraint? It's only explained in a loading screen or in-game tip (if you haven't turned those off) that you can melee downed enemies to perform a shakedown . This will play a short takedown animation that will reveal the positions of any remaining squadmates, whether it's one lone straggler or three of them. It's easy to miss the prompt, so be careful not to do a standard melee swing, as that won't reveal enemies, and you risk outright killing the downed enemy instead.
