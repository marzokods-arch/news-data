As gamers, we all get up in the morning, check the latest gaming news, download updates for the games we want to play, then spend five to six hours closely examining the specifications and technical drawings of the latest videogame patents. Amirite? OK, maybe videogame patents aren't at the forefront of our minds, but they do come up as a topic from time to time, especially due to some of the more, ahem, litigious game companies out there. And even when they're not in the news, it can be kind of fun to look through patents for various gaming tech and game systems, especially when it comes to the diagrams included in the patents. In that spirit, I've got a new quiz for you! I'll show you a diagram from a videogame patent, and you do your best to answer a multiple choice question about it. You can hit the Hint button to remove one of the wrong answers if you need a little help. Good luck!",

Gelsinger's retirement wouldn't last. In March of this year he was announced as the executive chairman of Gloo , which in its own words is a \"Technology Platform Connecting the Faith Ecosystem\" working on what it calls Christian AI. Gelsinger cheerily acknowledges that we're in an AI bubble, by the way, but reckons it's all fine because it won't burst for a few years yet . In a new interview with The Guardian , Gelsinger gets expansive about Gloo and his career pivot towards spreading the word in Silicon Valley. \"My life mission has been [to] work on a piece of technology that would improve the quality of life of every human on the planet and hasten the coming of Christ's return,\" says Gelsinger. This is referring to the idea of AI that is more aligned with Christian values, which for a religion with countless subsects is an interesti…",

Namely, they're fed up with pop-ads for the new Season 1 battle pass, they're unhappy with the new map Blackwell Fields , and they're miffed that the only way to complete weekly challenges is to play battle royale, a mode that doesn't necessarily appeal to the folks who paid $70 for Battlefield 6 three weeks ago. As expected, folks are taking their frustrations out on Battlefield 6's Steam rating , which has now dropped to an overall \"Mixed\" after an influx of over 5,000 negative reviews since yesterday. The flood of negative ratings pile on to an existing trend dating back over a week, around the time players were reacting to the too-blue \"Wicked Grin\" cosmetic , and when DICE axed XP gains from Portal servers in a bid to eliminate XP farms. \"Before season one it was like the moment when Gandalf showed in Helm's Deep there was hope.

    "body": "رغم خروج ريال مدريد من الكلاسيكو أمام برشلونة أكثر قوة، بعد الفوز الثمين بنتيجة (2-1) ضمن منافسات الليجا، إلا أن النجم الأوروجواياني فيديريكو فالفيردي لم يكن من بين المستفيدين من هذه المواجهة، إذ لا يزال يبحث عن مكان ثابت له في منظومة المدرب تشابي ألونسو التكتيكية الجديدة. فالفيردي شارك في اللقاء كظهير أيمن بسبب غياب داني كارفاخال، الذي سيبتعد عن الملاعب لمدة ثلاثة أشهر بسبب الإصابة، وهو ما يجعل الأوروجواياني مرشحًا للاستمرار في هذا المركز، رغم أنه لا يُفضل اللعب في الخط الخلفي. وبحسب صحيفة \"موندو ديبورتيفو\" الكتالونية، فإنه حتى مع عودة ترينت ألكسندر أرنولد، الذي يُعد الخيار الطبيعي في هذا المركز، فإن تشابي ألونسو يُفكر في الاعتماد على فالفيردي بالتناوب مع أرنولد، لتجنب إجهاد اللاعب الإنجليزي المعروف بكثرة إصاباته. في المقابل، يبدو أن المدرب الإسباني قد وجد التركيبة المثالية في وسط الملعب، بوجود تشواميني وأردا جولر، وعودة جود بيلينجهام إلى مستواه العالي، بينما شغل إدواردو كامافينجا موقع فالفيردي، وقدم أداءً جيدًا أقنع الجهاز الفني. وهكذا يجد فالفيردي نفسه مضطرًا للتراجع إلى الدفاع، للحفاظ على مكانه الأساسي في الفريق، في وقت لا يبدو فيه أن ألونسو مستعد لإبعاده عن التشكيلة، ما دام في جاهزية بدنية تامة. وتشير تقارير صحفية إلى أن وضع فالفيردي قد يُصبح ملفًا حساسًا جديدًا، داخل غرفة مل…",

Not quite a decade later, we find ourselves standing amidst the rubble of that once-great ambition, with a single question on our minds: What the hell went wrong? Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright . And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end : Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours ) but active development is over.

It's a bit more involved than a desktop pet, but brings me a more rewarding calm when I both want and do not want to do something. It plays a lot like the name suggests. You get a beefy hose, fancy attachments, and hop from client to client blasting grime off of surfaces, and that's its biggest appeal: just the raw, sensory satisfaction of stripping dirt off of things.

These games, so old and basic their first PC ports (to Japan's MSX in the 1980s) didn't even have side-facing sprites, are more than merely unmissable 40 years later: they're foundational works in the RPG genre. And thanks to these gorgeous remasters everyone can easily acquaint themselves with their importance and nod in sage agreement when someone claims it's possible to draw a line from Dragon Quest's \"little guy goes on a big adventure\" to Clair Obscur. I'm pretty sure that's what I'm supposed to say as a certified fan of ye olden dayes , anyway. Sometimes I feel like my job is to make sure these new-old games are digested in the \"correct\" way. I dish out appropriate explanations/excuses for their age and mumble phrases like \"timeless classic\" and \"historical context\" as I do so. Surely it'd be a complete waste of a re-release if these titans weren't respected as interactive history lessons, right? But what if there was another, better reason to play them that had nothing to do with the word \"nostalgic?\" What if I said you should pick them…",

In other words, you're spoilt for choice. But in a mode where your chances of success are at least in part determined by what gear you have, what you really need are the best guns . As you'd expect from a battle royale, the types of skirmishes you'll get into in Battlefield Redsec are more varied, so you'll need guns to compete in a variety of different situations. SMGs and shotguns may be lethal up close, but you're going to want something with a bit more damage at range to pick up the slack when you're in a long-distance relationship with your enemy. Below, I'll go over all the weapons you should look out for while looting or use in a custom loadout in Battlefield 6 Redsec.

Charts on pcpartpicker.com are telling: since mid-2025, DDR4 and DDR5 consumer memory kit prices have been climbing, with particularly notable spikes since September. That's true all the way from DDR4-3200 kits up to DDR5-6000 ones. To take one concrete example, this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 kit on Amazon , which was stable at $95 or less throughout most of the year, but from mid-August onward started climbing. Now, it's up to $184, which makes for a 94% increase. This, after a good few months of sustained DDR5 price drops through the tail end of 2024 and first half of 2025. DDR4 isn't safe, either, as this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4-3600 kit on Amazon shows.

Well, I'd argue it's when you need to strap a bunch of external devices to it in order to get the most out of it, which is exactly what's happened to the Strix Halo-powered OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex . It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff.

You'll also be offered new \"flaws\" (essentially traits) every time you level up based on your actions in-game. These range from being quite useful to something nobody in their right mind would ever pick, but if you're really into the roleplaying side of things, you might like accepting perks that call out your degenerate RPG behaviour (speaking for myself there). Below I've included my picks for the best traits in The Outer Worlds 2, plus my recommended negative trait if you do take one, and the reasoning behind that. Best traits to pick in The Outer Worlds 2 (Image credit: Obsidian) The best positive traits in The Outer Worlds 2 are: Brilliant : During skill selection, specialise in one additional skill.

Here, I'll run through every pet I've found and how to acquire each one.

Options to purchase the game are gone, the recent reviews are an angry chorus of fans blindsided by Amazon's decision to kill the game, and even the screenshots have vanished. In their place is a single, static image informing onlookers that content updates are done. You can compare the page's glow-down yourself. On the Wayback Machine , a version of the New World Steam page from October 7 features 14 screenshots, three trailers, and 'Mostly Positive' recent reviews, plus options to purchase either the game's standard or deluxe edition. It's now all gone. Which is more than a little odd, since Amazon explicitly said yesterday that the MMO would remain available for purchase \"on all platforms until further notice.\" Canny readers may note that Steam is a platform, and that no notice was given that the game was being removed from it. I've reached out to Amazon to ask about this, and I will update this piece if I hear back. \"New World: Aeternum is no longer releasing conten…",

During yesterday's GTC keynote presentation , Huang explained how it was—who'd a thunk it?!—Nvidia GPUs that would unlock the potential of quantum computing. Huang outlined how the individual bits of quantum computing, known as qubits, are inherently unstable, only surviving for a few hundred operations. But \"solving meaningful problems requires trillions of operations,\" Huang said. \"The answer is quantum error correction. Measuring disturbs a qubit which destroys the information inside it. The trick is to add extra qubits—entangled—so that measuring them gives us enough information to calculate where errors occurred without damaging the qubits we care about.\" In this scenario, hundreds of entangled qubits combine to form a single, error-corrected logical qubit inside a QPU or quantum processing unit.

What if I told you there's a way to get around this in the Battlefield 6 battle royale Redsec, if only you show some restraint?

This will play a short takedown animation that will reveal the positions of any remaining squadmates, whether it's one lone straggler or three of them.
