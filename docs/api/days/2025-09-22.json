It's got all the makings of something right up my alley with Spirit Hunter artist Kera and Higurashi When They Cry creator Ryukishi07, plus a bigger focus on its Japanese horror influences. So I was more than relieved to see our Silent Hill f review from my colleague, Elie Gould, sing its praises and call it an entry that can go \"shoulder to shoulder with other goliaths in the series\" while taking risks and doing its own thing. As for when the rest of us can play… well, that depends on your platform and when you buy it. Here's a quick rundown on the Silent Hill f release date and launch time schedule, plus how its advanced access works. When is the Silent Hill f unlock time?

Instead of writing, \"Wow, look at my busted-up leg,\" however, he shared a poem: Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.

It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.

You sprint past one of the hundreds of half-naked walking corpses in the street, but even though you're several feet away from one of them and moving much faster than it is, it instantly latches onto you. Now instead of sprinting you're stopped in your tracks and you've got a gross monster trying to bite you in the face so you have to spend precious seconds punching it until it lets go. There's got to be a better way! The rank-and-file infected Dying Light: The Beast are never much of a threat: they're slow, they're loud, and they don't do much damage, but man they do know how to grab you. It sounds weird to complain about a zombie grabbing you in a zombie game, I know. But the frequency in which a zombie grabs you is way, way too high in Dying Light: The Beast. First of all, I'm Kyle Crane.

Hacker and creator Aaron Christophel recently took to their YouTube channel to show Doom on a Pixo Aspire, which is \"a way overpowered vape, for whatever reason\" ( via VideoCardz ). It has a 32-bit Arm Cortex M4 processor, 384 kB of flash memory and up to 64 kB of SRAM. Christophel notes that it would need \"that last bit of RAM\" to run Doom natively, so this version is effectively sending game output to a bit of software, which flips the screen to run on the vape. In other words, a PC runs Doom but displays it on the vape's touchscreen via a USB Type-C cable. Christophel says you can \"use it as a second monitor\", which makes sense, should you have to show a mouse or some sort of small pet a duplicate of your screen. Hey, it's nice to have the option. If you have such a mouse, you can grab custom firmware via GitHub , run it on the vape, then mirror your screen. Impressively, this little vape has a Bluetooth LE chip and a microphone, too.

Since Dahl weapons no longer exist, the Kaosin is now a Vladof SMG with a completely different design. The Hot Slugger or the Hellwalker might be more practical for mobbing, but it's hard to beat the raw stacking damage potential of the Kaoson against bosses.

To access the Arch of Origo vault, you need to find all three vault key fragments in Terminus Range. Once inside, fight through three waves of enemies until you reach Origo.

According to YouTuber The Phawx , the device feels \"comically light\" without the external battery, and he likes it a lot with the battery slapped on the back. He says, \"I just ultimately prefer the battery pack on at all times.\" Effectively, with the Win 5, you can either keep it plugged in all the time, or connect a battery to the back of the device via a port and locking mechanism. Think of how the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons work, with a clip letting them slide up and out. It is not, however, hot swappable, so plugging out the battery entirely shuts it down. The Phawx points out that the battery strapped onto the back covers some of the device's intake fans, though he hasn't had the chance to fully test the thermals yet. He did, however, notice the fans felt a little louder with the pack on. In exchange for this strange battery system, you get the full-fat Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip, complete with 40 RDNA …",

It's certainly a skateboarding game, and it has decent bones to grow into something better, but as it currently stands in early access it feels half-baked, and could seriously improve some areas before it's held to the same standard as the series is known for. Being on your board is fun, which is the most important gold star a game about skateboarding can really receive. It's also quite challenging to mess that part up. Cruising around street-skating, pulling off curb grinds and flip tricks is easily the best part, and is what I spent a lot of my time doing. After all, that's what this whole experience is about. There is a significant \"one more run\" mentality, which led to a number of hours poured into runs of tricks I'm still yet to perfect.

And when I say tad , I actually mean a hugely complicated feat of highly-skilled engineering, as one modder amply demonstrates. Apple's latest iPhone 17 Pro Max , the most expensive one in the released launched lineup, is available with four storage options: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB and 2 TB. There's a $200 price tag difference between the first three, and because of the size of the capacity jump, a $400 gap between the 1 and 2 TB models.

As spotted by Hackaday , the half-hour-long video of the YouTuber making a 'portable' Xbox Original is sort of like the lovechild of a mad scientist, a teacher, and a stream of consciousness. After grabbing an Xbox that isn't working, James figures out that the DVD drive is flagging a hard drive issue, and fixes the DVD drive by replacing a tiny failing resistor with four separate, much bigger resistors, then hot-glueing them down. This is subsequently followed by smacking the top of the Xbox until the disk tray comes out. Then, after fixing the original Xbox, James takes it apart again and starts throwing the bits of plastic he doesn't need on the floor. Taking apart this plastic is important to get the central motherboard and necessary components as small as possible, and he replaces the big unwieldy hard drive with a CompactFlash drive, saving a little more space. …",

In a recent, brief chat with YouTuber HarrisonShippp , Ogg was asked how excited he was for GTA 6's release next year. \"I feel nothing inside,\" answered Ogg, definitively. And just in case you're wondering if that's a more general cry for help, he quickly made clear he was speaking specifically about GTA: \"I'm not a gamer. I've never played a videogame, so I feel absolutely nothing.\" Which, hey, fair enough. Some voice actors get super deep into their roles—like the cast of Baldur's Gate 3—and for others it's just a paycheque. Neither's an illegitimate approach, and Ogg has made clear before that he's not keen on GTA fans essentially treating him like Trevor in real life. But then it gets a little weirder. \"I think someone said yesterday at one point, 'You should play GTA 5,'\" recounted Ogg. \"I said, 'Why?' They said 'Because it's so great!' And I said,…",

Watching as the fog settled on Ebisugaoka, listening to the eerie sound design, and witnessing the emotionally tumultuous story, I felt the same pit in my stomach that I experienced back when I stumbled across Silent Hill for the first time as I searched for Cheryl. Silent Hill f may leave behind that old rural town, but it has more in common with previous games than just its title. Need to Know What is it? An action-adventure horror game set in 1960s Japan, full of horrific monsters and puzzles that are somehow even scarier.

I don't want a combat system where I can master the timings and get into a flow state, I want it to be janky and panicked like it's simulating what it would be like for an ordinary person to be handed a plank with a nail in it and thrown in a room with a monster made of nightmares. To cut a long story short, Silent Hill F is not that kind of game. It's the kind with an involved combat system it really wants you to get to grips with. You may be playing a teenage girl in the 1960s, but by god you're going to have to master the blade.

For one, they have a library of Hollow Knight challenge videos going back years, and while they never explicitly lay out the setup they use or show real world footage of their inputs, their gameplay footage across the two Hollow Knights is synced perfectly.

User Avdievs in the Steam discussion page for the patch points out that DLSS' texture filtering and antialiasing components can be desirable even in a game that should be easy to run⁠—and Legends of the Zone can be much more of a performance hog than the original releases. \"That DLSS is the perfect option for the ones wishing to play with their insanely taxing indirect lighting in 4k 60+ fps,\" wrote user Spleen, referring to a new graphical feature introduced with Legends of the Zone's enhanced global illumination.

It's a demo that delivers. Thrasher is a kinetic, engaging little rhythm game that boasts some excellent audio and visual design. It's a pretty classic score-chasing, time attack game where you're always trying to make more and more skillful moves with your \"magnificent space eel\" in order to hit circling motions and rack up a higher combo. The visuals are excellent in that nearly-off-putting, psychedelic way I want from this kind of game. There's a glowing space eel that evolves to get ever-larger as it flies across bizarre and sometimes mesmerizing landscapes. There's a huge baby with glowing eyes, which is a bit upsetting, but hey, look at that glowing eel. The music is, of course, great at inducing that flow state you want from a good rhythm game.

It's much more complicated than people think.\" DICE producer Jeremy Chubb noted that while players have \"really particular views\" about the original Operation Firestorm and how it should be remade, they may be disappointed if the developers don't \"evolve it and embrace the new ideas and features\" in Battlefield 6.

    "body": "I first encountered Wobbly Life a few months ago when searching for new games to play with my kid. It's a physics-powered open-world sim that roughly resembles a child-friendly Grand Theft Auto, a big colourful playground with activities that include races, delivering pizzas, and taking on taxi fares. My quickfire take is that it isn't as good as Human Fall Flat , but better than Totally Reliable Delivery Service and way less cursed than Roblox . At least, those were my thoughts before the 1.0 update , which expands Wobbly Life quite a bit . The launch version basically adds a second open world to the game, if you can consider outer flipping space a world, that is. Wobbly Life's cosmic expanse adds a host of celestial bodies and manmade structures for you to explore, from moons to hop around on to an elaborate station built into the side of an asteroid. These locations also afford new opportunities to earn cash. You can join the Asteroid Defence Unit and help shoot down pesky space rocks, delve into larger moonlets and mine them for minerals, or search for stranded interplanetary craft with the space rescue job. Alongside these repeatable jobs are more bespoke missions, such as be…",

A wayward patch issued in July triggered a rampant pregnancy epidemic , while the most recent Enchanted by Nature DLC received a less-than enthusiastic response from players. Now, it seems the community is generally fed up with the increasingly buggy state of the base game, with EA revealing plans for two solid months dedicated to bugfixes and quality-of-life support. \"We see your feedback on technical issues and game performance. And we want to assure you that your concerns are heard,\" the publisher wrote in a post on Monday . \"Over the next 8 weeks, our dedicated teams will dive in to resolve current issues and get ahead of unforeseen technical disruptions.\" Those plans kicked off in earnest with a big update to the base game that arrived late on Thursday. The headline feature of this patch was a newly added playpark for kids to run themselves ragged on, as well as a 'play pretend' interaction for kids who presumably can't get to said playpark for whatever reason. The update also adds a prototype \"memory boost\" feature to eke some extra performance from your PC, though you'll need to opt into this in the game s…",

In 1998, Baldur's Gate redefined what a computer RPG – and videogame interpretation of the D&D ruleset – could be. Just two years later, Baldur's Gate 2 expanded on it so much that development nearly ballooned out of control. This is the story of one of the most influential and ambitious RPGs ever made. Many of the great RPGs are etched into the popular imagination by their beginnings, those tentative first steps in a new fantasy world that tease the vastness ahead, and the freedom to carve your own path through it. The first steps into Baldur's Gate 2's world are one of those moments. After a tough opening sequence that sees you escaping captivity from the wizard Irenicus, you emerge into Waukeen's Promenade, the trading hub of Amn's central city of Athkatla. Surrounded by golden minarets, it's a bustling amphitheater of traders and thieves, wealthy and poor – a filthy and vibrant snapshot of urban plenitude.

Luckily, I'm able to postpone starting a degree in medieval history just so I can drop 'fief' into conversation more often without coming off as a total weirdo, because feudal estates happen to be the focus of Wartales ' newest DLC. Wartales, for those unaware, is a low-fantasy RPG where you control a band of mercenaries. At a glance it looks ferociously boring, but as I discovered in my Wartales review , it proved a surprisingly capable story engine laced with gripping turn-based tactical combat. Wartales has received consistent updates—both free and paid—since it launched in 2023, but its latest expansion is apparently the one fans have been anticipating most heavily. \"Since the early days of Wartales' early access, one request has consistently stood out from the community: owning and managing a fief,\" writes developer Shiro games in a recent Steam post . \"With our upcoming DLC, Contract: The Fief , we're finally bringing that vision to life.\" The Fief adds a more strategic layer to Wa…",

Granted, it also tends to create a lot of bugs and dead ends in the process. But when Shadows of Doubt works, it's one of the best games ever made. Yet the latest update somehow makes Shadows of Doubt even more conceptually appealing, by letting you play as a detective who is also a rat. The modifiers update injects a bunch of optional mutations into the sim's algorithmic genes, one of which lets you prowl its rain-slicked alleys as a trenchcoat-wearing rodent. Simply titled \"rat detective\", the modifier shrinks your character down to a mere 10cm tall, letting you experience the powers and perils of being a city-dwelling rodent. The advantage of being a rat detective is you can climb on walls and ceilings, and sneak past people more easily. The downside is that you can't question people, and citizens may even be hostile to your presence. I gave the rat detective …",

Anyway, instead of being all sad about how history becomes legend and legend becomes myth, let's celebrate the fact that FEAR remains incredibly playable today—if you download the Echo Patch . It's not one of those games that's completely busted without mods, but if you play it at any resolution above 1080p all the text will look like it was written for ants. The Echo Patch fixes that, and adds controller support so you can play it on your Steam Deck. It also lets you disable the letterboxing in cutscenes and optionally make the flashlight last forever if you don't want to have to chase down batteries for it.

Terminally Online This is Terminally Online: PC Gamer's very own MMORPG column, and I am not Harvey Randall, your usual author. I'm Joshua Wolens, filling in for Harvey this week with a lot of wistful, misty-eyed old-man musings about the glory of the MUDs of yore. Look away and look back to the last time anything was good: the '90s, when the internet moved too slow to cook your brain and the absolute peak of graphical fidelity was translucent water and the PlayStation 1, whose vertices swam and staggered beneath their own raw aesthetic power. Back then, if you wanted a world—a real world—there was only one place to go: Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs). And frankly, my contention is that for all our modern graphical horsepower, that's still the case. Sacred texts MUDs, if you're not familiar, are large, shared, entirely text-based world…",

    "body": "If you've been playing Elden Ring Nightreign's intense new Deep of Night mode, you may have noticed your Depth level ranking sometimes doesn't increase as it should after a victory. That glitch and some much-needed quality-of-life tweaks are getting addressed in an upcoming patch Bandai Namco announced on Friday. Along with a fix for the Depth level increase bug, this patch will also give you an option to voluntarily decrease your Depth level and add Depth level demotion protection for level three onward. You gain points toward promotion for winning runs, and lose points when you fail, meaning it's possible to be demoted, similar to competitive multiplayer ranks in other games. This new protection feature effectively gives you a second chance to hang on when you would otherwise get demoted starting at Depth level three. You then get two extra chances for levels four and five each. Lastly, this patch will also allow Steam players to return to an ongoing session if they get disconnected due to Steam server issues. The voluntary demotion, meanwhile, lets you turn down the heat if you need more practice or want to better accommodate lower-ranked friends. If you've tried the new Deep o…",
