This 2D point-and-click from 2015 brought a Tim Burton flair to the genre, tasking you with saving your family—including Grandpa-raffin and Mothdog—from the dark monsters that have overtaken your home. Bringing light to the darkness is made a bit easier by the fact you are Bulb Boy, a boy who can unscrew your lightbulb head to help you solve puzzles. Also, you're immune to being electrocuted, just in case that should ever come in handy. It's a puzzle-adventure in the Machinarium style, full of secrets and silliness. Bulb Boy is currently available for free on Steam to bring attention to its recently released sequel, Bulb Boy 2: Jar of Despair . This time, Bulb Boy's mission is to find a jam jar in the cellar of the Bulb House, a simple task made nightmarish by the creature who wants to take your head for its own. It's got a demo if you want to try before you buy. The Bulb Boy adventures are twisted affairs that look like they're entirely made up of the…",

The last roundup of announcements for 2025 coincides with the Warhammer World Championships, and has shown us stuff like new miniatures coming to Grand Cathay's army in Warhammer: The Old World . But we've also had an update on the latest chapter in the life of Demetrian Titus, protagonist of the bolterporn action games in the Space Marine series. After debuting as a captain of the Ultramarines in the first Space Marine, he was busted down to lieutenant for the sequel, and as we see in the trailer has now regained his former title. As of this promotion he's captain of the Second Company in place of Acheran, the guy in Space Marine 2 who constantly tells you he can only spare three men. Maybe that's why Acheran was demoted, although it's more likely he's dead or in a dreadnought. I'm sure we'll find out later. With that new rank comes a new responsibility. Roboute Guilliman, Primarch of the Ultramarines , has tasked Titus with taking back the 500 Worlds—the Ultramarines' domain, which has been lost to various enemies like the tyranids and Word Bearers over the last 10,000 years.

Barring a delay, that would be the latest we can expect to see some form of substantial, presumably paid DLC for Nightreign.

It's easy to dismiss videogame recipe books as a frivolous marketing gimmick, and I'm as guilty of this as anyone else. My original plan for this article was to find the most preposterous example of a gaming-themed cookbook, then attempt to recreate the silliest recipe from it. I assumed this would be easy. I mean, nobody could actually write a good Sonic-themed cookbook, could they? Yet when I looked into this odd corner of gaming culture, I noticed two things. First, many of the gaming-themed recipe books you'll find on Amazon are not only well designed, but they're also filled with dishes that look like something you would actually want to eat.

It seems like Arc Raiders has successfully bridged the gap between the sickos and the rest of us, though, as not only is it the extraction shooter of choice for the chronically employed —it's one of the biggest games on Steam. According to SteamDB , the game is off to a screaming start, just hitting a peak concurrent player count of over 354,000 Friday night. That's a wild number for any shooter, especially given that the game only released a little over a week ago. It even briefly overtook Battlefield 6 , one of the biggest games on Steam in general right now , with BF6 settling in at around 318,000 players around midnight UTC Saturday morning and Arc Raiders sneaking past it with over 329,000. Arc Raiders can't match the long-running shooter's soaring highs, but it's drawn in a huge and consistent audience in its first week.

This week I've been: continuing to team up with players in Arc Raiders, and blasting the mean ones. As much as I love the nail-biting tension of extraction shooters, it's long been a genre obsessed with a rigorous gear grind and slow pace that make it almost impenetrable for new players, or those that can't dedicate more than a few hours a day or even a week. The one exception to this until now has been Hunt: Showdown , and while I can't recommend it enough, let's face it, it's not your typical extraction shooter. So, for all these years, the extraction shooter has remained the dominion of a select few with enough time and patience to dedicate to it—and invariably trounce anyone who dares to give it a casual go. Of course, with enough time and determination, you'll eventually join that elite band, but my point is that the genre isn't known for being welcoming and even semi-casual. If you want a genre to truly grow and experiment, encouraging a more diverse audience will do it. Just as I thought perhaps the genre would never become truly …",

The result utterly entranced Sam Greer, who gave it a whopping score of 95 in her Hyper Demon Review . \"The dizzying heights you reach with each powerup and each foe overcome are virtually, and visually, euphoric,\" she wrote. \"The entire dark landscape of the world literally wraps around your vision, and as your field of view folds on itself you can funnel every creature into the sights of your wrath. One small misstep can still end you, but for a few, fleeting seconds you are unstoppable.\" One other key difference between Devil Daggers and Hyper Demon is that the latter had a multiplayer mode, though you'd be forgiven for not knowing this since it was left as a secret for players to discover. Now though, developer Sorath has made the multiplayer mode not just public knowledge, but public full stop, releasing it as a free, standalone game on Steam. Hyp…",

Sure, Helldivers 2 deserves its success, but Extermination's developer, Offworld, must be a little green watching Arrowhead's bug-blasting, fascist lampooning sci-fi action game gallivant off with all of the money. Hence, it would only be fair for Offworld to copy Arrowhead's homework a little, which appears to be the case for the cooperative spinoff's latest update. Update 1.8 will primarily introduce a Company progression system to Extermination when it arrives later in November. But I'm more intrigued by its tertiary feature—in-game airstrikes. Now, these work a little differently from Helldivers 2's airstrikes. Where Arrowhead's game lets you deploy them as a Stratagem, they form a side-mission in Extermination, something you can take on alongside the primary objective of building/defending your base.

But developer Tomas Sala wasn't satisfied with the end product, and has spent the last year or so overhauling the game in his spare time from supporting his other game— Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles . The result released this week, a free update that, according to Sala, reworks \"literally everything\" about the game. Certainly, the changes are extensive. The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster provides a complete visual overhaul of the game, not only improving the lighting, visual effects, animations etc, but also reworking the world itself. Many of its cities and key locations have been remade, while others have been expanded to look grander and more impressive. The comparison shot below gives you some idea of the differences (Image credit: Tomas Sala) The remaster also alters many of the Falconeer's key mechanics.

Back in 2006, Microsoft released a seemingly innocuous device called the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000.

The great Steam enwidening came to the Steam beta client in August (you can opt into beta updates in the \"Interface\" tab of the Steam settings), and has now rolled out to everyone. As one effect, the screenshots on Steam store pages can now be displayed at a higher resolution, and there are new theater and full-screen browsing modes for images and trailers.

A recent and hilarious example is a bug allowing players to use deployable items such as the barricade to squeeze through locked doors. Streamer canefis demonstrated the technique in a post on X . You can get into ANY locked door in @ARCRaidersGame with a deployable barricade #plsfix pic.twitter.com/uR6qrYsrpF November 5, 2025 Naturally, this was not an intentional use case, so the bug was fixed Thursday in a small patch . But players are pointing out that without their incidental role as a skeleton key, barricades aren't the most desirable item. As one reply on an X thread discussing the bug from pizzaboneman put it: \"Darn it! I thought the barricades were useless so I sold them all. Turns out they were the master key!\" I'm sure it's a tough balancing act for Embark: on one hand, a wall wherever you need one might be the only thing between you and a hail of enemy bullets.

Blizzard has yet to step in on a newly discovered method of spawning endless numbers of enemies in the latest phase of Legion Remix. Unlike the Gulp Frogs incident in Mists of Pandaria Remix, this farm seems relatively less broken, but it still can net you millions of infinite power, which is used to level up your weapon and increase your character's overall strength. It's been two days since players began capitalizing on it and Blizzard hasn't made any move to kill it. The exploit does, however, cause serious lag from the volume of enemies pouring in if you happen to be nearby, which might be enough for it to land on Blizzard's nerf radar. For now, players are grouping up to slay as many demons as they can before the valve gets shut off. The Sentinax farm, as it's being referred to, is pretty straightforward. In the Broken Shore area there's an event full of demons that drop items you can use to spawn more demons. The trick is to join a group so you can keep a constant supply of them flowing in.

The good news is that one UK team reckons it's cracked the problem, and it's already made the tools for game devs. Human vision has a horizontal field of view of around 200 degrees or so, but the vast majority of 3D games stick with 75 to 90 degrees. Many will let you play around with an FOV (field of view) setting, but once you go over 100, the edges go all kinds of wonky. It is possible, of course, to code a game so that it doesn't do this, but it's easier said than done. That's because while it's a piece of cake to increase the horizontal size of the frustrum created by the camera in a 3D world, objects at the edge of the FOV will look distorted and stretched unless this is all accounted for and corrected. And what might work fine at 110 degrees, for a game that's normally 90 degrees, might not work very well at higher FOV values. Enter stage left, Fovo Techno…",

Rockstar announced yesterday that GTA 6 was getting delayed again , and is now scheduled for November 19, which seems like an eternity away. As you can imagine, GTA 6 fans have been reacting really normally to this news. No, I'm serious, after the last delay, it seems like everyone went through all the stages of grief and has reached acceptance , or near enough: \"Nothing wrong with delaying a game. Nothing at all. But why keep giving dates with so much confidence when they know it needs more time to polish?\" (Image credit: Rockstar) But among fans trying to rationalise another delay, there are others within the gaming industry sharing support , thinly-veiled threats , and even some theories about the breaking GTA 6 news. \"Interestingly, just a little industry knowledge for all you gamers, a Nov 19 launch puts them outside the nomination window for most game awards in 2026,\" Palworld's communications director, Bucky, says in a social media post . \"Intentional or…? Either way, expect to see many games (especially AAA ones) swerve to avoid the 2027 awards season.\" Interestingly, just a littl…",

Arc's relatively peaceful game world (not counting all the damn robots) has thus come as a genuinely pleasant surprise, and instead of getting mad and going back to Find My Frogs after an hour or two, I'm thoroughly hooked. I had just one problem: The sound in Arc Raiders would persistently hiccup and hitch, and the troubles would get worse the longer I played. After three or four matches, the audio would drop out for a full second or two, intermittently but repeatedly, multiple times per minute. The game continued to run normally, to be clear, it was just dead silent. The effect was incredibly distracting and irritating, and for a game as dependent on audio cues as Arc Raiders, it was a deal breaker: I was ready to quit playing if I couldn't find a fix. Fortunately, I did find a fix. A search through the Steam forums revealed that I was far from alone in struggling with this issue, which made me feel slightly better about things—misery and company, and all that. The real relief, though, came from Steam user awsk, who shared a fix …",

    "body": "Surviving Mars: Relaunched is an unusual remaster, though this is not particularly clear at a glance. Remasters tend to fall into two categories: gussied up classics that take advantage of technological improvements, new consoles and a new audience, or cynical attempts at double dipping. Surviving Mars comfortably slots into the first group, but given the original's relative youth, you could be forgiven for assuming it's part of the latter. Haemimont Games and Paradox Interactive released the original Surviving Mars back in 2018. In my Surviving Mars review , I said it was \"a lot of hard work, but managing a burgeoning colony never stops being compelling\", and then slapped an 80% on it. Thanks to the DLC, we were then able to keep expanding our colonies with new features all the way up to 2022. (Image credit: Paradox) This is not an ageing classic, then. Nor has its relevance diminished. Survival city builders are even more popular than they were when Surviving Mars first launched, and the fantasy of colonising Mars is as zeitgeisty as ever. It largely feels as fresh as it did back in 2018. Yes, it launched during a previous console generation, but it's compatible with PS5 and Xbo…",

But I still consider myself a fan of the Mafia series and, indeed, of Hangar 13 as a studio—it proved it can put out a game I love with Mafia 3 (and an idea I love with Rhapsody , its sadly canned post-Mafia-3 project), and I want to see more from both. So, regardless of my cold feelings toward the game, I'm glad to hear The Old Country did well enough to appease Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K's parent company, Take-Two. Zelnick told The Game Business that Mafia: The Old Country's sales had surpassed Take-Two's internal expectations—though he didn't say what those expectations were—and that \"What we suspected was confirmed.\" What did Zelnick and company suspect? \"If you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.\" Which sounds to me like Take-Tw…",

So it's only natural that you'd do exactly the same as one Redditor did, and try to get it to run Cyberpunk 2077. Well, they did more than just try ; they actually succeeded. In a post on Reddit , user Retrotom explains the steps they followed to get Nvidia's DGX Spark to natively run Cyberpunk 2077. The little 'AI-supercomputer-in-a-box' sports a GB10 APU, which has a 20-core Arm CPU and a Blackwell-based GPU with 6,144 shader cores. Cyberpunk 2077 runs on DGX Spark from r/nvidia The latter is, to all intents and purposes, the same GPU that's in a GeForce RTX 5070 . Same number of shaders, TMUs, ROPs, ray tracing units, tensor cores, and L2 cache. Where they differ is in VRAM and power. While the GB10 sports 128 GB of LPDDR5x unified memory across a 256-bit wide memory bus for 273 GB/s of bandwidth, the GB205 in the RTX 5070 is home to 12 GB of GDDR7. AI models need lots of RAM, which is why the DGX Spark is so heavily loaded compared to the graphics card, but as the RTX 5070 is for gaming, it us…",

That's just the kind of world we live in now. As an acknowledgement of this change, Collins Dictionary has awarded the term Word of the Year, despite, well, being two words. This week, Collins Dictionary posted a blog celebrating and explaining its choice for the Word of the Year (via The Register ). Vibe coding is relatively contentious in itself. Generative AI has been widely criticised for flagrantly ignoring copyright and for its adoption by investors declaring it's the next big thing in games, movies, or whatever art form you hold dear. And that's because there are productivity gains to be made in skipping through all the manual work of creative labour. Of course, that comes with its own set of problems. An overreliance on the black box that is generative AI can make coders less able to actually fix their own problems when they inevitably pop up. As well as this, we've seen stories of AI coding tools 'panicking' and destroying entire databases , and coding assistants being vulnerable to targeted attacks . That is to sa…",

Cyberpunk 2077 is, now, an excellent game—worthy of inclusion on our list of the top 100 games you can play right now, no less. At launch? Less so . Now, the studio has extended a little social media backing to Rockstar over yesterday's delay to Grand Theft Auto 6 . One of the many venues in which Rockstar announced GTA 6's delay to November next year was X (the everything app!).

Now, this may not seem like a lot compared to games like Valorant, League of Legends, or even Overwatch 2, but Arc Raiders isn't a free-to-play game, so these charges are on top of the $40/£30 game price.

That's unacceptable.\" While another player points out , \"Those skin prices are kinda...brutal. And to add to that, we still have gameplay affecting items in the battlepass, in a $40 game.\" The discontent with how Embark is pricing their cosmetics has clearly been spreading for some time now, with the latest store update sparking an even angrier reaction from fans. 📡Store updateWhether you're cutting new paths topside or wading through the muck for buried treasure, gear up like a true survivor.The Le…",

However, the findings of one US repair shop suggest that this might not be the case, because at least two Corsair models don't have all of the fixes, and there's no way for owners to apply them. That's according to Matt's Computer Services on YouTube, which says that a $5,000 Corsair gaming rig, with a Core i7 14700KF, had been submitted to the repair shop three times, due to crashing in games. The host of the video explains that, having gone through every possible check and attempt at solving the problem (including usual things such as reinstalling Windows and trying a more powerful PSU), the issues persisted. It was only when they delved into the motherboard's BIOS that the penny finally dropped. The pre-built in question is using an Asus Prime Z790-P motherboard, updated to Corsair's most recent BIOS for it (version 9046).

Trials provides more challenges for players to complete during excursions, like damaging Hornets, searching new wave husks, or destroying Ticks, Fireballs, and Pops, alongside the quests that different raiders from Speranza give you. For each challenge, there are three milestones at 1,000 points, 2,500 points, and 4,000 points, and each milestone will reward you with a better mystery prize. (Image credit: Embark Studios) At first, I thought that these were easier quests that I could simply tick off my to-do list without thinking too much about it, and while challenges at the lower levels aren't too difficult, it often takes a dedicated run to complete them.
