    "body": "Apparently someone thought it was a good idea to give the Eartha Kitt disco-era defender a soundbar and subwoofer to review. Not only that, they gave it to the person who's never known the delight of having such a snazzy sound setup before. Will she go drunk with power? Will she stop referring to herself in the third-person? Is this what happens when you listen to I Don't Care at full volume one too many times? Well friend, if that's simply not your cup of tea, I'm afraid the playlist is only going to get much, much worse from here. Once I'd got my grubby little mitts around the Creative Stage Pro sizeable box, and subsequently torn into its cardboard prison with a scavenger's frenzy, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy the setup process was. Yes, this is a beefy sound device that requires a lot of wires plus its own power plug, but you're only setting up one soundbar alongside one subwoofer, and it all comes with straightforward, easy to understand instructions in the box. Also inside the box is a remote, though this runs off of 2x AAA batteries that are very much not included. The soundbar features a few rubberised control buttons too, so it's not the end of the world if pick…",

Chances are, if you like to explore, you've already found one or two of the Mossberries when you were making your way up to the top of the Moss Grotto.

We've got character motivations, stakes, and jokes not rooted in years-old memes! Which is fair enough. Borderlands 3's story ( which, warning, I will be spoiling ) was so atrocious it nearly spoiled what I otherwise found to be a great little game. I massively enjoyed zipping around as Zane with my movement speed build, and the moment-to-moment blasting was as consistent as ever. And then the story would happen and I'd start itching desperately to be shooting something again. It wasn't just the jokes, either. Borderlands 3 tripped over itself when it came to its serious moments, too. Maya's death, its insistence that Ava was the chosen one, Lilith throwing herself into a moon for some reason, any time the Calypso twins, who could've been 1,000% more interesting, were on screen—it wa…",

Examples include MS-DOS and GW-BASIC , and now another blast from the past has been added to the collection. Somewhat surprisingly, though, this one is really old and just so happens to be a version of its first-ever software product. Specifically, it's a port of BASIC, the OS that founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed for use on the Intel 8080-powered Altair 8800 . As explained in a Microsoft blog , the version that's just been released on GitHub was created for computers using MOS Technology 6502 processors (via The Register ). The Intel 8080 and MOS 6502 were both 8-bit CPUs, launched in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Although the latter was less capable than the former, it was considerably cheaper, which is why Acorn Computers, Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and many others bought it in droves to power their computers and consoles. Such was the popularity of the 6502 that Gates and Ric Weiland wrote a port of BASIC specifically for that processor, which Commodore paid a flat license fee to use on its PET computer (then i…",

    "body": "شهدت مواجهة الأرجنتين مع فنزويلا، التي انتهت بفوز راقصي التانجو (3-0) فجر اليوم الجمعة بتوقيت جرينتش، الظهور الأول كأساسي للاعب ريال مدريد الشاب، فرانكو ماستانتونو، بينما لم يتجاوز بعد 18 عاما. وخاض ماستانتونو 62 دقيقة، قدّم خلالها أداء واعدا، إذ لمس الكرة كثيرا، وسجّل 44 تمريرة صحيحة من أصل 51. لكن أبرز ما أثار الجدل، كان رفضه تمرير إحدى الكرات إلى زميله الأسطورة، ليونيل ميسي، مفضلا التسديد على المرمى. ولعب ميسي، أمام فنزويلا، ما يُرجح أنها مباراته الأخيرة مع منتخب الأرجنتين داخل البلاد، مع قرب اعتزاله الدولي. واعترف ماستانتونو بخطئه، حيث نقلت صحيفة \"ماركا\" الإسبانية قوله: \"أردت أن أقتل نفسي في تلك اللحظة، لكن ميسي تفهّم الأمر.. اعتذرت له 3 مرات على هذه اللقطة\". وأضاف: \"كان أمرا لا يُصدق أن ألعب إلى جانب ميسي.. إنه حلم حياتي، وحدوث ذلك على ملعب ريفر بليت جعل الأمر أكثر روعة.. لقد كان مثلي الأعلى منذ الطفولة، تابعت مسيرته كاملة، ورؤيته يلعب بتلك الجودة عن قرب أمر مذهل\".",

This is exactly what's happened with an Indiana-based lawyer called Mark S. Zuckerberg, as reported by TechCrunch . Sharing a near-identical name with Meta's CEO might seem to be a relatively innocuous thing, as does the fact that the aforementioned lawyer has been legitimately using Facebook to advertise his legal services. However, as explained in a short report from WHTR, Meta's moderation systems have apparently flagged such Facebook posts as being a false impersonation of the other Zuckerberg and promptly taken them down. The lawyer has, of course, paid fees for using a commercial Facebook page, but you never get them back if a post is removed. This has apparently been going on for so long that Mark Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta for breach of contract and other aspects.

It's definitely not uncommon for exploration-focused platformers to have obscure or downright useless maps, but for a while Silksong seems like it might not even have one at all. Don't worry though: not only does Silksong have a map, but it can be very useful so long as you cough up some rosaries ASAP. After about an hour in Silksong you'll encounter the NPC Shakra in The Marrow—listen out for the lovely yodelling. After some dialogue they'll offer to sell you a bunch of map-centric stuff, and your first instinct might be to ignore it. Of course this metroidvania will just plot out my map as I explore it, right? Nope: not only do you have to buy maps, but you have to buy map markers and other useful icons, such as those demarking resting places. Oh, and you also have to buy the ability to see yourself on the map. Even though Shakra's gear might seem expensive in total, you should 100% buy it all up as soon as you meet them.

Considering he's recently announced that Stardew Valley will be getting a 1.7 update and apparently done a little moonlighting as a bug, I think he might've been onto something. I checked Silksong's credits today to see how many folks contributed to the long-awaited metroidvania outside Team Cherry's core trio, and there's Barone, right alongside several members of designer William Pellen's family. Considering Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight released within a year of each other and both went on to become some of the most successful indie games of all time, I'm not too surprised to see they travel in the same circles. Or at least they're friendly enough that when Team Cherry was in need of \"additional character voices\" for Silksong's new cast of characters, Barone got the call. Or perhaps Barone is such a massive Hollow Knight fan that he begged to go bug mode for the sequel? (Image credit: Team Cherry) If you harbor any doubt that it's the Barone, The…",

The Apple dance, as it became known, was a huge TikTok trend in summer 2024 and has been adopted by Charli XCX herself: Heyer even performed the dance live at one of the star's concerts. It was impossible to avoid at the time, and was subsequently incorporated into a Charli XCX-themed \"Brat\" update for the Roblox game Dress to Impress. The legalities all get a little murky here. Heyer and Roblox were apparently in talks to license the dance in early August last year, but then the update containing the emote was released before any \"signed agreement\", and Heyer subsequently copyrighted the dance. Her lawsuit claimed that Roblox had made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November 2024, and said Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" Well, now she has been, although there's no disclosure of the su…",

Instead, there are a few ways to get Rosaries, which you'll use to purchase items from merchants like Pebb in Bone Bottom or maps from Shakra once you encounter her. Here I'll explain the main ways to get Rosaries, though I'll update this if I come across any better methods later on.

    "body": "Deadlock's \"Six New Heroes\" update has added, you guessed it, six new heroes. You gotta respect the economy of language there. Two of which, the Drifter and Victor, are causing a bit of a scene. See, both the Drifter and Victor are what you might, in the MOBA lingua arcana, call \"pub stompers\"—if you play around their abilities, you'll mostly be fine. If you don't, they'll snowball into an incredible problem. When it comes to the Drifter, this issue's a little more apparent. Bloodscent gives you a literal blood trail and heartbeat sound effect while you're near isolated enemies and, more importantly, a permanent stacking weapon damage buff whenever you kill (or assist in a kill) an enemy hero. In other words, if you've got terrible map sense and are blindly farming the jungle while the Drifter's about, he's going to get a bazillion Bloodscent stacks and run you over. Victor's a little more complicated. His Aura of Suffering builds up damage to enemies and himself, his Jumpstart trades HP for regeneration and movement speed, and his Pain Battery lashes out whenever he takes damage. With the right item build, these abilities can make him an absolute menace—but the real kicker is his…",

Politicians, CEOs, and even Tim Sweeney are not happy about what is being perceived as just \"a slap on the wrist\" for its illegalities. As noted by the Guardian , Barry Lynn, the executive director of the Open Market Institute thinktank, says, “Judge Mehta’s order that Google share search data with competitors and cease entering into exclusive contracts does nothing to right those wrongs. Instead, it lets Google and every other monopolist know that even the most egregious violation of law will be met with a slap on the wrist.” Nidhi Hedge, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project , argues, \"You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot… Similarly, you don’t find Google liable for monopolisation and then write a remedy that lets it protect its monopoly.

Well, now Valve has trademarked \"Steam Frame\" a new brand for use with gaming consoles and peripherals. The shizzle here involves a couple of new trade mark applications by Valve centred on the term \"Steam Frame\", as spotted on Reddit yesterday . The more interesting and specific of the two says, \"STEAM FRAME™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of computer game consoles for recreational game playing; video game consoles; video game accessories, namely, controllers for video games.\" That's about as unambiguous as it gets. Of course, applying for a trade mark doesn't guarantee that trade mark gets used. It could even be an intentional distraction designed to draw attention away from some other naming scheme or project. But if you take it at face value, there's a good chance Valve is indeed planning some kind of console and it's going to be known as the Steam Frame.
