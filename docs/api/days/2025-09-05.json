Unless, that is, you actually enjoy map reading and inferring your location through local landmarks—I doff my hat to you if so. The good news is that if you miss a map in Silksong and fail to find resident cartographer Shakra in her new spot, then you can still get the map quite easily. All you need to do is head back to Bone Bottom, jump up the platforms marked with gold rings on the right side of the town and hit the ring tied to the post in Shakra's usual spot two times . This will make Shakra return, where she'll offer you whatever map you somehow managed to miss. Similar to Cornifer in Hollow Knight, Shakra is on her own journey through Pharloom, so she can jump around to new locations when you hit certain progression points or enter new areas, making it tricky if you miss her in one place and accidentally stumble into an entirely new region on your wanderi…",

Musk sees himself as an outsider and heroic figure taking on the status quo, despite being the world's richest man, the owner of X, and a sometimes-ally of Donald Trump. When Musk rails against 'the establishment', it's only when it threatens his vast fortune, his ability to indulge in hate speech, or when he's promoting conspiracies. Indeed, he posted multiple tweets during the Covid-19 lockdowns where he drew connections between essential measures to protect the vulnerable and the plot of Deux Ex, where a man-made pandemic is deployed by the world's richest man to advance a political power play. Unsurprisingly, Austin Grossman, who wrote Deus Ex alongside Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, is not a fan of Musk's take on the classic cyberpunk immersive sim. Deus Ex—and Dishonored, which Grossman also wrote—is a game very much interested in the powerful, and the tools they use to control people. It's also an exploration of the ethics of transhumanism—an industry that Musk himself is extremely invested in. \"That kind of pol…",

No, the LCD-S20 is for sitting back and engrossing yourself in your favourite game or album and enjoying the tonal brilliance of planar magnetic drivers. Marketed at professional musicians and producers, the LCD-S20 are a little out of our usual comfort zone for PC gaming apparel. However, what makes them great for recording a track in a studio also has a benefit for PC gaming. Namely, planar magnetic drivers with SLAM technology and superb sound isolation. The LCD-S20 look a lot like the Audeze Maxwell . That's a pair of headphones that we rate very highly, with multiple members of the PCG hardware team using them as their daily driver, and I'll get back to comparisons with these later in the review.

I picked up the 2017 game pretty cheap, for reasons I'm not quite sure of—I've never really played or enjoyed sports games, I don't care for golf, and I'd never even heard of the series prior to this purchase. Maybe it was the promise of anime models that looked like they'd been ripped out of a 2000s online rhythm game or sheer summer boredom, but I'm glad my silly little brain made that decision. Everybody's Golf is an excellent game, and I loved the 2017 version's open courses that I could drive a cart around with my own wee custom character. Also, you know, the actual golfing part was surprisingly good with tight physics and a steep but fairly intuitive learning curve. (Image credit: Bandai Namco) It's why I was especially excited to discover that the series was going to be making its PC debut with Everybody's Golf Hot Shots. It's exclusively been a PlayStation thing since the first game released in 1997—except for the one game that made its way to mobile in Japan. What I wasn't so excited about was the fact Clap Hanz is no longer at the helm. Hot Shots instead has been tackled by…",

Konami has acknowledged the issues and says it's \"currently investigating the causes and working on a patch to resolve these problems\", but as yet there's no ETA.

This is backed up by a statement from Broadcom's CEO, Hock Tan, who said that the company had secured $10 billion in AI system orders from a 'new customer', which should result in significant revenue growth in 2026. As things currently stand, OpenAI uses large-scale computer systems with Nvidia chips for AI model training and inference.

Now, though, with AI becoming increasingly able to beat Turing tests and the likes, it's increasingly important to be able to verify whether someone online is a person or a bot. So, lest we head towards a vindication of the dead internet theory , we also need increasingly more accurate methods for distinguishing neurons from silicon. This is no less true for gaming than anywhere else. Players using bots to cheat in online games is a real problem , and as AI gets more sophisticated, we can only assume the problem will get worse. Anti-cheats tackle this issue from one angle—checking program executables and so on—but another way of tackling it is to check that a user is a live person, a method that is often called 'liveness detection' or 'proof-of-human'.

    "body": "في الوقت الذي تستعد فيه إنجلترا لاستئناف مشوارها في تصفيات كأس العالم 2026، يجد المدير الفني توماس توخيل نفسه في قلب عاصفة من التساؤلات والانتقادات. الفريق، رغم تصدّره مجموعته بالعلامة الكاملة بعد 3 مباريات، لا يبدو مقنعًا في أدائه، ولا يمنح جماهيره الثقة بأنه سيكون بين المرشحين البارزين لحصد اللقب في الولايات المتحدة والمكسيك وكندا صيف العام المقبل. المعسكر الأخير في يونيو كان ناقوس خطرٍ حقيقي: فوز باهت على أندورا أعقبه سقوط ودي أمام السنغال، زاد الشكوك وأشعل الجدل حول هوية المنتخب تحت قيادة مدربه الألماني الجديد. واليوم، ومع غياب ثلاثة من أبرز نجوم الفريق – جود بيلينجهام، بوكايو ساكا، وكول بالمر – بسبب الإصابة، يبدو أن الطريق نحو استعادة الثقة سيكون أصعب مما توقعه الكثيرون. لكن، كما يقول المثل، الأزمات تصنع الأبطال. وهذه المرحلة قد تمنح توخيل فرصة لتقديم حلول جديدة، وبث دماء شابة، وصياغة ملامح فريق قادر على تجاوز الصعاب. وهنا تبرز سبعة أسئلة محورية لا بد للمدرب من الإجابة عنها خلال أيام قليلة، قبل مواجهتي أندورا وصربيا اللتين قد تحددان شكل المزاج العام قبل المونديال. 1. هل يبقى جوردان بيكفورد الحارس الأول؟ منذ 2018، لم يعرف المنتخب الإنجليزي حارسًا أساسيًا سوى جوردان بيكفورد. كان الرجل الأمين تحت العارضة، وصاحب لحظات حاسمة في يورو 2020 وكأس العالم 2022. لكن الواقع تغيّر: المنافس…",

One thing I've seen repeated often in Borderlands 4's interviews is the insistence that yes, we've learned our lesson with Borderlands 3, and we're not going to give you a headache this time . We've got character motivations, stakes, and jokes not rooted in years-old memes! Which is fair enough. Borderlands 3's story ( which, warning, I will be spoiling ) was so atrocious it nearly spoiled what I otherwise found to be a great little game. I massively enjoyed zipping around as Zane with my movement speed build, and the moment-to-moment blasting was as consistent as ever. And then the story would happen and I'd start itching desperately to be shooting something again. It wasn't just the jokes, either. Borderlands 3 tripped over itself when it came to its serious moments, too. Maya's death, its insistence that Ava was the chosen one, Lilith throwing herself into a moon for some reason, any time the Calypso twins, who could've been 1,000% more interesting, were on screen—it wa…",

Examples include MS-DOS and GW-BASIC , and now another blast from the past has been added to the collection. Somewhat surprisingly, though, this one is really old and just so happens to be a version of its first-ever software product. Specifically, it's a port of BASIC, the OS that founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed for use on the Intel 8080-powered Altair 8800 . As explained in a Microsoft blog , the version that's just been released on GitHub was created for computers using MOS Technology 6502 processors (via The Register ). The Intel 8080 and MOS 6502 were both 8-bit CPUs, launched in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Although the latter was less capable than the former, it was considerably cheaper, which is why Acorn Computers, Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and many others bought it in droves to power their computers and consoles. Such was the popularity of the 6502 that Gates and Ric Weiland wrote a port of BASIC specifically for that processor, which Commodore paid a flat license fee to use on its PET computer (then i…",

In a chat about Silksong and the mad scramble of devs to escape the orbit of its release date , Lowrie mentioned that there is, of course, an upcoming release even bigger, more enormous, more Brobdingnagian than Hornet and her needle: GTA 6. \"There are AAA games and then there's AAAA games,\" said Lowrie, \"and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game.\" That's quintuple-A, if they start blurring together at some point for you like they do for me. \"It's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands.\" Silksong might have loomed over other indie games, but GTA 6 hangs over anything you could conceivably call a videogame.

This is exactly what's happened with an Indiana-based lawyer called Mark S. Zuckerberg, as reported by TechCrunch . Sharing a near-identical name with Meta's CEO might seem to be a relatively innocuous thing, as does the fact that the aforementioned lawyer has been legitimately using Facebook to advertise his legal services. However, as explained in a short report from WHTR, Meta's moderation systems have apparently flagged such Facebook posts as being a false impersonation of the other Zuckerberg and promptly taken them down. The lawyer has, of course, paid fees for using a commercial Facebook page, but you never get them back if a post is removed. This has apparently been going on for so long that Mark Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta for breach of contract and other aspects.

You need to gather 25 Spine Cores from these creatures, but unlike gathering the pilgrim shawls for Bone Bottom, these items don't simply drop from killing them—there's a special trick to farming the item.

Fortunately, the Cult of the Lamb social media pages have been drip-feeding information to us about the size of the DLC in comparison to the first game, how it ended up getting slightly out of hand, and why the devs have chosen to release a paid update rather than another free one. According to a TikTok posted by Cult of the Lamb , the DLC will be \"almost as long as the original game\" for no other reason than \"we flew a little too close to the sun here. We tend to go all out, be at weddings, to raves, to three free massive content updates. This DLC is not free, but I promise you'll love it.\" They're not wrong, either. If there's one game I know I can rely on when it comes to crazy marketing, it would be Cult of the Lamb.

    "body": "For the brave among us who are diving into Silksong without having played Hollow Knight, some of the game's quirks will seem a bit opaque. One of these quirks is the map system, or rather, the seeming lack of it. It's definitely not uncommon for exploration-focused platformers to have obscure or downright useless maps, but for a while Silksong seems like it might not even have one at all. Don't worry though: not only does Silksong have a map, but it can be very useful so long as you cough up some rosaries ASAP. After about an hour in Silksong you'll encounter the NPC Shakra in The Marrow—listen out for the lovely yodelling. After some dialogue they'll offer to sell you a bunch of map-centric stuff, and your first instinct might be to ignore it. Of course this metroidvania will just plot out my map as I explore it, right? Nope: not only do you have to buy maps, but you have to buy map markers and other useful icons, such as those demarking resting places. Oh, and you also have to buy the ability to see yourself on the map. Even though Shakra's gear might seem expensive in total, you should 100% buy it all up as soon as you meet them. It's going to make early exploration a lot more …",

Considering he's recently announced that Stardew Valley will be getting a 1.7 update and apparently done a little moonlighting as a bug, I think he might've been onto something. I checked Silksong's credits today to see how many folks contributed to the long-awaited metroidvania outside Team Cherry's core trio, and there's Barone, right alongside several members of designer William Pellen's family. Considering Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight released within a year of each other and both went on to become some of the most successful indie games of all time, I'm not too surprised to see they travel in the same circles. Or at least they're friendly enough that when Team Cherry was in need of \"additional character voices\" for Silksong's new cast of characters, Barone got the call. Or perhaps Barone is such a massive Hollow Knight fan that he begged to go bug mode for the sequel? (Image credit: Team Cherry) If you harbor any doubt that it's the Barone, The…",

As a point of comparison, the original Hollow Knight's Day 1 concurrent player count on Steam peaked at 812 players. In other words, there are roughly 615 times as many people playing Silksong in its first hours than there were playing Hollow Knight at launch. Call me crazy, but I think this one might be a big deal. While it's hard to say anything definitive without digging into the numbers—SteamDB and similar services are more interested in presenting all-time concurrent player counts than day one peaks—Silksong is c…",

Instead, there are a few ways to get Rosaries, which you'll use to purchase items from merchants like Pebb in Bone Bottom or maps from Shakra once you encounter her. Here I'll explain the main ways to get Rosaries, though I'll update this if I come across any better methods later on.

In May of this year , the roadmap said the black version of Noctua's NF-A12X25 G2 fans, known as Chromax Black, would be launching in Q3. That has now been pushed back to Q4 this year. That's a shame, as I know plenty of people have been waiting on these fans in a more palatable colourway. They're still the best PC fans around, even in beige, promise. Two products we saw over at Computex, the Antex Flux Pro Noctua Edition, a new version of Flux's PC case with a wood finish on the front, and Pulsar Feinmann mouse with a fan embedded in the back, were both originally intended to launch in Q4, 2025, but will now launch in Q1, 2026.
